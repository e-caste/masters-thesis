00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.870
PROFESSOR: We'll be talking
about the diode and charge

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.830
separation inside
of a solar cell.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.540
So at the end of
last class, we ended

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.680
with this little
demonstration right here,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.690
where after much
discussion about band

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990
gaps and light
absorption, we agreed

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.610
that that little
piece of silicon

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.080
there should be
absorbing the light

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.420
and free charges should be
generated inside the silicon.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.800
But without some
fixed fields, some

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.810
built in field inside
of the silicon material,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.110
it wasn't possible to
measure any current output

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.380
once we shown light on it.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.620
And that made sense.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.490
There were free charges
being generated,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.090
but due to Brownian motion,
there was no net charge flow.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.267
They were just moving
around with no net movement.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:05.850
And as a result,
there was no current.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.580
Now if we attach the
batteries in series,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.160
the batteries apply to field
across this little piece

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.110
of silicon resulting
in current flow-- more

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.630
precisely, drift current
across that piece of silicon.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.580
And today we're
going to be talking

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.060
about how the solar cell device
has a built in electric field.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.407
So obviously we don't want
an external power source.

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.490
We don't want to have a
set of batteries attached.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.130
That defeats the purpose of an
autonomous energy generation

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.986
device.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:36.860
We'll be talking about
how the built in field

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.670
inside of a solar
cell comes into being.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910
As we've followed in
the last few classes,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.384
we will be discussing
physics when it is necessary,

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:48.800
taking a very
engineering approach

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.802
to this so as to keep everybody
from a business background,

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.510
from a mechanical
engineering background,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.420
and from a material science
background on the same page.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.330
We will have, in the
lecture, I think n plus 2.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.970
Very physics-y
lecture, and we'll

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.360
be getting to the nitty-gritty
of semiconductor physics

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.940
and how it relates to
solar cell devices.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.731
So for those of you
who are already experts

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:10.199
in this material, bear with me.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.816
And again, try to relate
to the solar cell device.

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:15.190
You may not have had that
connection in previous lectures

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.040
in previous classes.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.230
So we'll jump right on in.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.640
To remind everybody, you're
here in the fundamentals.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.140
We'll be getting
to the technologies

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.040
and cross cutting
themes after we really

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.980
have a good, solid understanding
of how a solar cell works.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.975
The conversion efficiency is the
output energy versus the input.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:32.600
We have our inputs in the solar
spectrum, the outputs in charge

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.820
collection, and we've been
steadily making progress

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.020
down toward the outputs here.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.580
We discussed the
solar spectrum, then

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.270
light absorption, the
charge excitation,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.330
and finally now we're on to
charge drift and diffusion.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.310
So we have the total
solar cell efficiency

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.390
as a product of all the
individual processes.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.480
And any one of these
processes can kill

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.784
the efficiency of the device.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.950
That's why it's important
to think about your device

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.970
like so.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.530
And just not to make this
introduction so boring,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.190
I want to really
emphasize this point.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.090
So I'm making it
over and over again.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.530
But I wanted to relate this
to other engineering devices

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.440
as well.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.730
Namely, today it's
a Toyota Prius.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.770
These are all the
components inside of a Prius

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.870
that have to work well
for the car to function.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.320
If one of these
components, let's say

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.750
this one, the inverter, is
broken or not functioning well,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.240
you're not going to have the
car in an autonomous mode.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.100
So in a similar
manner, in a solar cell

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.100
we have to have all the
different pieces working

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.490
well together.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.180
So the essence of
charge separation,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.920
we're going to begin our
exploration of charge

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.210
separation using
the diode analogy.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.170
And just to situate
everybody, I brought

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.090
in a number of small discrete
components, small diodes.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.890
Those are the ones
that are orange-ish

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.460
that have two leads coming out.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.030
There are a bunch of
transistors in here as well.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.739
Those have three little
leads coming out.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.196
You'll be able to
distinguish them.

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:58.320
But just to situate
ourselves, these are diodes.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.660
The essence of a diode is that
you have a dissimilar material

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.340
on either side of the device.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.510
That's why I've worn these
dissimilar colors today

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.927
to denote that on
different sides.

00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:12.260
And of course, you have this
mixed region in the middle.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.680
We have here an n and
a p on either side.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.040
And if current is attempting
to flow in one direction,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.640
it will be barred.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.723
But if it attempts to flow
in the other direction,

00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:22.360
it will go through
rather easily.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.240
That's the essence
of what a diode is.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640
How is it made?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.150
Well, we're
manufacturing materials

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.660
of the same base element.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.930
Let's say, silicon.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.630
But we're doing
something special

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.650
to the material to add
particular types of charges

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.300
on either side.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.150
We call doping.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.210
And we'll get to
that in a few slides.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.430
Why do we care about diodes?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.520
Well, this is the essence
of charge separation.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.160
And this is what drives the
voltage inside of a solar cell

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.660
device.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.750
That's why we care.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.170
It's pretty important for
at least understanding

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.810
the traditional
semiconductor-based solar cells

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.550
like this one here.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.840
So for those history
folks, I figured

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.350
I would add a quick
at description.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.120
You typically see
the diode represented

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.650
like this in an
equivalent circuit

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.630
diagram, a little triangle
and a line orthogonal

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.480
to the direction of
the current path.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.220
And does anybody know
where that comes from?

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.620
No?

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.280
All right.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.030
So back in the day
of that, we used

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.151
to have vacuum tube components
for a lot of our-- I

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.660
would say the discrete
components within our circuits.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.590
In the case of a diode, you
could envision a very simple

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.290
one where you have a filament
that by thermionic emission

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.630
heats electrons off
of the filament,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.050
and then they're collected by
this other collector up top.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.400
If you remember our etymology
in Greek, ana is above,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.510
cata is below.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.470
Catatombs, right?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.950
Catatonic, below.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.520
So the anode up above is
collecting these electrons,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.510
and then the electron
flow is moving

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.090
like this, which means that
our current flow, defined

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.810
as the flow of
positive charge, is

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.460
moving the opposite direction.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.950
And that's why we have a similar
representation right here

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.260
from our vacuum technology.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.080
You could envision
also a point where

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.100
the field is
concentrated at that tip

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.910
and electrons are spreading off.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.437
So learning objectives.

00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:19.520
Today is going to be rather
intense, rather dense.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.650
And so we will be trying to hold
as much as possible in our RAM,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.840
so that by the end of class
we can really truly understand

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.650
the solar cell as an entirety.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.190
If you get lost along
the way, come back

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.510
to these learning objectives.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.780
They're like flag
posts along the way.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.284
So you can find yourself again.

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:39.950
What we're going to
do first is describe

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.832
how the conductivity
of a semiconductor

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.790
can be modified by the
intentional introduction

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.960
of dopants.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.630
What this means is
we're going to learn

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.170
how to create the n
and the p over here.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.840
So if we look at a
semiconductor such as silicon--

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.730
this is a little piece
of silicon right here.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.610
Here's a silicon-based
solar cell.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.992
It's a fairly easy
semiconductor to understand.

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:04.700
It's what's called a
unary semiconductor.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.650
It means it's comprised
of one element.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.440
Silicon right here in
the periodic table.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.940
This is just an excerpt
from the rightmost side

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.590
of the periodic table.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.300
And silicon has 4
valence electrons.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.340
So it forms what are called
sp3 hybridized orbitals when

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.510
it's in a crystal structure.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.460
It has four bonds with
its nearest neighbors,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.820
all of equivalent type.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.740
And those are covalent bonds.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.740
So you can envision that if
you were to introduce an atom

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.200
and substitute out one
silicon atom in that lattice

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.430
for something else that
has 5 valence electrons,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.450
such as a phosphorus, it's
almost of equivalent size.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.300
So those material
scientists in the room

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.950
from the Hume-Rothery
rules, you should

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.450
be able to estimate that the
miscibility is rather large.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.140
In other words, that you could
mix in a high concentration

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.670
of phosphorus into your
silicon given the similar size

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.420
and similar atomic structure.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.050
Electronic structure, rather.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.440
So you substitute here
a group 5 element.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.400
Silicon is a group 4 element, as
is carbon, germanium, and tin.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.480
So we substitute in
a group 5 element.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.670
Let's say a phosphorus atom in
for one of our silicon atoms

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.810
right here.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.530
And this phosphorus
atom will have

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.880
4 plus 1 valence electrons.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.660
So those 4 valence
electrons will

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.300
bond to the silicon atoms,
the nearest neighbors.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.170
And that one extra valence
electron will be left over.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.745
It will have nobody to bond to.

00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:24.540
And we'll describe
mathematically

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.710
what happens to that
electron in a minute.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.550
But in principle,
just intuitively you

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.800
should be able to understand
that that electron should

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.258
be able to be
removed rather easily

00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:34.920
and move around the
lattice with relative ease.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.419
Likewise, instead of moving one
to the right, if we move one

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.600
to the left into our
group 3 column here,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.470
we can dope our material
with a boron atom, let's say.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.030
Substituting one silicon
atom for a boron atom.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.980
Boron has 3 valence electrons.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.830
Now, those 3 will form bonds
with the 3 silicon atoms.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.420
And then you'll
have a missing bond,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.600
a missing electron if you will.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.590
That will be a hole.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.240
So with phosphorus, or
group 5 elements in silicon,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.290
we can dope the
material with electrons.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.390
And with group 3
elements in silicon,

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.200
we can dope the
material with holes.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.180
And this is interesting
because now we

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.890
can arbitrarily change the
density of charge carriers

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.370
in our bands.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.530
As long as these
holes and electrons

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.320
can become dissociated
from the dopant atoms

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.980
and move freely
around the lattice.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.490
So that's a big
question, how easy

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.300
is it to remove that electron
around the phosphorus atom?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.950
If you want to think
about this electron just

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.950
from a quantum
mechanical sense, you

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.319
could almost envision that
this electron is attracted

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:38.360
to the phosphorus atom
because the phosphorus has

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.440
one extra proton than
the silicon, right?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.730
So it has a positive
charge here in the nucleus.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.180
And here's a negative charge.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.810
In net, they balance out.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.929
But if the electron
goes too far away,

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:51.720
it will feel that
attractive potential back

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.840
and be drawn back towards
the phosphorus atom.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.923
So the big question is,
what is the binding energy

00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:57.834
of that electron to
the phosphorus atom?

00:09:57.834 --> 00:09:59.250
And a simple way
to think about it

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.010
is through a hydrogenic model.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.570
If you consider a hydrogen atom
to have an electron surrounding

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.010
it, then that binding
energy is well-defined.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.230
But in the case of a phosphorus
atom within a silicon lattice,

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.510
it's a little trickier.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.380
Because now we have to
worry about the electron

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.120
screening coming from the
other elements in our lattice.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.420
And we also have to worry about
a property of the electron

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.610
in a crystal, which changes
the mobility of that electron

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.910
through the crystal.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.610
So what we do is we
treat this as a hydrogen

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.814
atom, 13.6 eV binding energy.

00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:40.230
But then we do a
couple of things.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.604
We account for
electron screening

00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:44.134
and we account for what
we call effective mass.

00:10:44.134 --> 00:10:45.800
We'll get back to
this in a few lectures

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.212
and describe exactly
what this is here.

00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:50.170
We need a little bit more
semiconductor physics

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.850
to understand it
in its entirety.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.380
But think about an electron
moving in a crystal

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.850
as moving differently
than moving

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.310
in free space in a vacuum.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.340
That's what this
term here is about.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.740
This other term, the epsilon,
is rather straightforward.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.470
It's the electron screening.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.595
It's the fact that you have
so many other electrons

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:06.730
in your system here that
screening the charges,

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.420
screening the electron from
the extra positive charge

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.110
in the nucleus here.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.140
And so it becomes easier for
that electron to move away.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.140
This is about a factor of
0.1, the effective mass.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.150
And that's about 1/100.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.210
And so overall, we're
reducing the binding energy

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.490
by about a factor of 1,000 down
to about 10 m eV in practice.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.870
So if we were to run through
the calculation for silicon,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.520
the binding energy of that
electron around the phosphorus

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.730
atom in the silicon lattice
would be around 10 m

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.470
eV on that order.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.590
And that is very,
very small compared

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.160
to the thermal energy in your
system, just kt, Boltzmann's

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.334
constant times the
temperature in Kelvin,

00:11:46.334 --> 00:11:47.750
we have a thermal
energy somewhere

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.540
on the order of 26 m eV.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.666
And that's enough to
dissociate that electron

00:11:51.666 --> 00:11:53.790
and allow it to move freely
throughout the lattice.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.625
Question?

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:56.445
AUDIENCE: Is that
electron screening

00:11:56.445 --> 00:11:58.630
related to the [INAUDIBLE]
constant at all?

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.410
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolutely.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.201
AUDIENCE: I just had
a [INAUDIBLE] question

00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:03.500
about the holes.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.560
So I understand that-- I can
imagine an electron moving

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.340
around in the lattice.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.930
But I imagine that
a hole moving would

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.668
be forming a bond-- breaking
and forming bonds over and over.

00:12:17.668 --> 00:12:19.858
Does that actually happen,
or are the electrons

00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:21.924
more free to move?

00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:22.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.160
This is an excellent question.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.830
The question, if
I may paraphrase,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.240
relates to the hole and
electron mobilities.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.449
How easy is it for them to
move around the lattice?

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.490
And typically, the hole
mobility is about a third

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.200
of the electron
mobility in silicon.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.060
So absolutely, it is a
little bit more difficult

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.500
for those holes to move around.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.130
Holes, you may recall,
are quasi-particles.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.653
OK, so we have an
understanding of doping,

00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:47.870
a rough understanding
at this point.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.420
We understand that if we dope a
certain type of material, let's

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.940
say our n-type material,
with phosphorus,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.000
we have an excess of electrons.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.120
And if we dope another
type of material

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.160
with an excess of, say,
boron, we would then

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.900
introduce a large
number of holes

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.350
and the material might have
a majority conductivity

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.100
through our holes.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.080
Hence, we call it p-type.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.920
n and p comes from
negative and positive.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.790
Negative being the
electron charge

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.660
and positive being
the hole charge.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.291
So that's where the n-
and p-type come from.

00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:21.340
Great.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.200
So now, pictorially
we're going to draw

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.800
a pn-junction or a junction with
our fixed and mobile charges.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.010
OK, so let's start out with a
simple review of Gauss' law.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.810
Spatially variant fixed charge
creates an electric field.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.130
What do I mean by that?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.870
I mean that if you have
a high concentration

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.370
of fixed charge over here and
a lower concentration of fixed

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.209
charge over here, an
electric field will develop.

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:50.750
And that's the
expression right there

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.190
that relates-- that describes
this in mathematical terms

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.330
where we're using psi here
as our electric field.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.200
We're using psi instead of e.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.060
You probably remember
your physics textbooks

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.060
using e as the electric
field because we're

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.100
going to reserve that variable
for the electron energy.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.500
That will come in
several slides forward.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.580
So the charge
density will be given

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.640
by that rho and the material
permittivity by our epsilon.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.690
And an example is
a capacitor here.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.710
All I've done is expanded
the dimensionality

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.692
of the derivative here.

00:14:23.692 --> 00:14:24.900
I'm looking at the capacitor.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.490
I have fixed charge
on either side.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.850
And I have electric
field in between.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:35.010
Now, this right here, obviously
in the case of a capacity,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.670
you're under high vacuum.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.560
Just as a very quick aside,
this is-- I can't resist.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.690
This is really an
interesting historical note.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.979
This space right here in
the diode as we recall,

00:14:45.979 --> 00:14:48.520
where you have the thermionic
emission of the electrons going

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.853
off to the other plate, this
space right instead of here

00:14:50.853 --> 00:14:54.070
is called the space
charge region.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.290
Keep that name in mind.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.230
We're going to come back
to it in several slides.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.920
So a bit of history there.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.060
So we have the capacitor
as our prime example.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.310
We have fixed charge on
either side and electric field

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.310
in between.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.770
And note that the charge
will move parallel

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.100
to the electric field.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.150
If there's no electric
field-- in other words,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.036
if we're just exciting
charge inside of a bare piece

00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:16.410
of silicon with
no electric field

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.310
applied-- imagine
our batteries here

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.090
are taken out of the circuit.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.970
We'll have simple
Brownian motion

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.850
of those photo-excited electrons
until they decay back down

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.200
into their ground state.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.187
However, if we apply
an electric field,

00:15:28.187 --> 00:15:29.520
now we have the Brownian motion.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.420
But superimposed on top
of it, a certain drift

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.470
of the electrons in response
to that electric field.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.700
And we can describe this
mathematically as well.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.600
The drift currents for
holes and electrons being

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.739
described by the charge q.

00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:44.280
Note that the charge
q is going to be

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.660
different for the electrons
and the holes-- the same value,

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.060
but negative or positive.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.430
The mobility of holes and
mobility of electrons.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.500
The density of
holes or electrons.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.380
And then finally, the
electric field right here.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.810
And the reason in this
equation you typically

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.340
see the q's being
the same value here,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.932
although no minus
sign is put in front,

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.640
is because under the
same electric field,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.056
you'll have electrons drifting
in this direction and holes

00:16:11.056 --> 00:16:13.980
drifting in the
opposite direction.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.600
So it's important to keep these
signs straight in your mind.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.675
Yeah, question?

00:16:18.675 --> 00:16:19.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.746
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.460
So p and n denote
the concentrations

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.870
of free electrons or
free hole-- actually,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.950
free holes for free
electrons, respectively.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.670
So you can almost think
of p as being synonymous

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.710
with the density of boron atoms.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.450
If every hole is
ionized, meaning

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.460
dissociated from the dopant
atom and free to move around

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.256
the crystal, then
the density of holes

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:46.630
and the density
of boron atoms is

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.530
going to be almost identical.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.800
Likewise, for
phosphorus atoms and/or

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.360
the donor atoms
and the electrons,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.860
you'll have almost
an equal number.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.710
So that's right here.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.962
The n is related to
the number of electrons

00:17:00.962 --> 00:17:02.670
that are free to move
around the crystal.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.630
The p, the density of holes
that are free to move around

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.440
in the crystal.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.910
And these are given in units
of number of particles charge

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.740
carriers per unit volume.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.619
So per centimeter
cubed, let's say.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.483
Question.

00:17:17.483 --> 00:17:21.347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you're creating more holes.

00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:23.659
So is that not on the
same order of magnitude

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:25.700
as the number of holes
introduced by [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.866
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:31.170
So the density of holes and
electrons here in the dark

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.190
is dictated by the
dopant density.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.870
Where are we?

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.810
Right here, for instance,
the dopant density.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.620
If we add light, that's
a complicating factor.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.564
The intrinsic population
of electrons and holes

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.730
and the dopant concentration
of electrons and holes,

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.400
we are adding a photo-generated
population as well.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.700
Let's leave that
for next lecture

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.980
and try to simplify things.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.410
So we just discussed
the diode in the dark.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.640
Perhaps we turn the light
off here just for effect.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.312
So we're trying to take this
piece by piece, so that we

00:18:02.312 --> 00:18:04.270
can really construct
everything and not add too

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.390
much into the pot at one time.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.890
I wanted to discuss the
notion of electron drift.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.530
And I also wanted to
review the concept

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.459
of diffusion, which everyone
should be familiar with.

00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:17.500
This is the reason why
we're breathing right now,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.670
and why all the air
molecules aren't crowded

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.100
into that corner of the room.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.590
It's because of Fick's law,
the process of diffusion.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.630
If we have a concentration of
a particular species in one

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.850
spatial location, the natural
tendency through random motion

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.880
is for that concentration
to distribute

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.210
itself equally throughout.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.960
And this is described
very nicely by Fick's law.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.040
If we want to describe
a current to it,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.160
we would then describe
the current of holes

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.000
and the current of electrons
by, again, the charge.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.160
The diffusivity, this is
a quantity typically given

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.920
in units of centimeters
squared per second.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.080
And the gradient.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.750
In other words, the
concentration gradient.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.720
In this case, in one dimension.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.360
And that, again, should
be review for most folks

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.600
from physics.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.720
And so we can see here
two different methods

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.597
of currents, two different
methods of current flow inside

00:19:12.597 --> 00:19:13.680
of a semiconductor device.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.670
We can have diffusion
or we can have drift.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.660
Drift occurs when
there's an electric field

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.500
present and diffusion occurs
when-- well, in this case,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.900
diffusion can occur in the
absence of an electric field

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.350
simply when there is a
concentration gradient present.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.840
So we can envision,
just quickly,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.970
that if we have an
electric field confined

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.200
to a certain region of
our solar cell device,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.380
the electric field will be
dominant in one portion.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.710
And if the rest of
our device we don't

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.930
have a strong electric field,
but the electrons nevertheless

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.530
can sense the electric
field far away

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.370
because of the
concentration gradient,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.870
diffusion can drive
those electrons--

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.300
can drive those electron
toward the electric field.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.190
So in our solar cell device,
the ratio of drift and diffusion

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.650
current will change as
a function of distance

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.900
from the pn-junction,
from the built-in field.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.600
OK, so I want everybody
to upload into their RAM

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.180
the checkerboard example
that we went through.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.570
Because this will be important
for understanding the next few

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.510
slides.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.560
So let's imagine these
n-and p-type materials are

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.490
in contact, but there's
this imaginary barrier

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.281
right between them.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.560
Here are p-type materials,
here are n-type materials.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.690
And let's parse
through this figure.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.530
Let's dwell, just a minute.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.010
So we have this
imaginary boundary

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.650
between p-type material over
here and n-type material.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.720
The boundary is right
here in the middle.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.800
The blue dots here
are representing

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.590
mobile holes, holes that
are free to move around

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.870
the material.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.800
And while there's this
imaginary barrier here,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.940
these holes are just
moving in Brownian motion.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.680
There's no net current.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.100
There's no net charge flow.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.710
These minus signs that are left
behind are the boron atoms.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.160
The boron atoms have one
less proton in their nucleus

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.000
than the silicon atoms do.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.970
And so the hole plus
the negative charge

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.050
that's within the boron
atom core if you will,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.280
that combination is neutral.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.100
So we haven't perturbed the net
charge of the entire system.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.630
But locally, if we draw a
little circle around these two

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.360
for instance, the boron
atom that's fixed,

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.300
that's not moving.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.100
The boron atom is bound to
the neighboring silicon atoms.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.420
It's not moving around.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.410
And the hole, which is free
to move around the material,

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.790
now we have net
charge neutrality.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.380
But if that hole
moves too far away,

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.940
then you could have
a field building up.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.680
On the other side, very similar.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.250
Here we have phosphorus atoms
embedded within our silicon

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.070
lattice.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.677
The phosphorus atoms have one
extra proton in their nucleus

00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:49.760
than the silicon atoms do.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.980
Hence, we denote that as a
positive charge right here.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.530
And there's an extra electron
associated with the phosphorus

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.220
atoms.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.180
Now as those electrons move
around, when it's in isolation,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.960
again, there's no
net charge flow.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.300
There's no current.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.840
And we have a situation
of net charge neutrality.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.880
Question is, what
happens if we remove

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.260
the barrier in between the two?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.990
Let me ask you just
a basic question.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.130
Would the phosphorus atoms
diffuse over to this side?

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.970
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.345
PROFESSOR: Probably not,
because the phosphorus atoms are

00:22:22.345 --> 00:22:24.280
bound to 4 silicon neighbors.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.540
Those bonds are really
tough and it's probably not

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.270
going to break.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.990
Unless you heat it up to
a pretty high temperature.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.809
But the electrons are
free to move around.

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:34.100
They're in the conduction band.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.910
They're able to move.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.290
And because the binding
energy to the phosphorus atoms

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.849
is on that order of
10 m EV on that order,

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:43.640
the thermal energy here
at room temperature

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.780
is enough to dissociate
them, and to allow

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.140
those electrons to move away
from the phosphorus atom thanks

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.400
to the screening potential
of the surrounding lattice

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.370
and thanks to the fact that the
electrons inside of a crystal

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.450
are more easily-- can more
easily move than in vacuum.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.180
So when we remove that
boundary in between,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.950
what begins to happen?

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.220
So we've removed the boundary.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.610
We have these two materials
in direct contact.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.400
The nuclei are not moving.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.140
The fixed charge associated
with the boron atoms

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.830
in this side and the
phosphorus atoms on that side

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.160
are not moving.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.250
However, the instant you remove
this boundary in between,

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.430
there is a high concentration
of electrons over here

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.970
and a very low concentration
of electrons over there, which

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.929
means that you will have
a diffusion process.

00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:31.220
So the concentration gradient
drives the electrons over

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.510
to this side.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.340
Likewise, holes are being
driven from here over to here.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.580
Now, notice what happens.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.940
Holes carry a positive charge.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.450
The fixed charge from the
phosphorus is also positive.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.430
So you have a buildup
of net positive charge

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.620
on this side of the junction.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.570
Electrons are negative
charge carriers.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.880
The boron atoms have a
net negative charge here.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.421
And so you have a
net negative charge

00:23:51.421 --> 00:23:52.770
building up on this side.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.640
And now you have
a field beginning

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.150
to develop, an electric field.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.220
And at some point, this
built-in electric field

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.640
will counteract the
diffusion process.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.760
The diffusion current is driving
electrons in this direction,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.720
but the field will be driving
them back the other way.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.360
And it's that equilibrium that
establishes the pn-junction.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.200
It's that equilibrium
that defines

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.820
the width of this region here,
this transition region, which

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.390
comes in a variety of names.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.930
The transition region is also
called the depletion region.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.740
And it's also called
the space charge region.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.610
Interesting how these words
and terms come back into use.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:37.200
So that's the essence of the
formation of this junction.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.100
We have this
diffusion process that

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.380
drives the carriers from
this side into this side.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.330
And then as we have the
electrons moving over

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:51.032
here, and summing to
the boron nuclei that

00:24:51.032 --> 00:24:52.740
are left behind once
the holes, likewise,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.156
have moved over
to the other side.

00:24:54.156 --> 00:24:56.610
We have a buildup of net
negative charge on this side,

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.040
a buildup of net positive
charge on that side,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.810
and the establishment of
a built-in electric field.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.120
That's cool.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.430
It takes a while
to really get it.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.460
And so the chessboard
example was brilliant.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.100
I thank Joe for that.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.000
And hopefully, this
as well reinforces

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.250
several of those concepts.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.250
And it might take some time
studying it on your own

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.340
or setting up special
office hours with Joe

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.380
or coming to my office
hours on Mondays.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.220
But whatever it takes, make
sure that you understand

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.040
this concept well--
the fundamental--

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.975
gaining an intuition
about the concept.

00:25:31.975 --> 00:25:33.710
We'll be getting
into the math soon.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.751
And if you don't have a
good, solid understanding

00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:39.920
of the intuition of where
charges are moving around,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.760
it becomes less easy, let's
say, to really get the math.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.690
So we have a buildup
of net charge

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.040
on either side of the junction.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.790
We have a buildup of
net negative charge

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.499
on one side of the
junction and a buildup

00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:55.873
of net positive charge on the
other side of the junction.

00:25:55.873 --> 00:25:57.400
And this line
right here is meant

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.990
to represent that dividing
line where the two materials

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.640
initially came together.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.420
So the dashed line is meant
to represent the real charge

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.050
distribution and the
boxed colored rectangles,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.340
the rectilinear boxes, are meant
to represent an approximation

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.140
that we'll use for the
rest of today's class.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.190
We're making successive
approximations

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.070
here because we want the
mathematics to be manageable.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:29.830
You can, of course, discretize
this entire material

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.590
in one dimension, for instance,
and do a finite element

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.290
solution.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.000
We'll show you the equations
that you can use to do that

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.960
later on in today's class.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.080
So we have the net
charge distribution

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.150
on either side of the
junction shown here.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:49.310
We also have, as a result
of that net charge,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.460
an electric field.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.130
And this goes back to Gauss'
law, or the derivative form

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.670
there of.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.990
And so we have here a built-in
electric field as you can see.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.314
And the field reaches a maximum
right here in the middle.

00:27:04.314 --> 00:27:05.480
So that kind of makes sense.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.490
If you're too far away
from that junction,

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.740
you're not going to-- if
you're a charge carrier,

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.220
you're not going
to see the field.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.700
But if you're right there in
the middle of that junction,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.950
that field is going
to be very strong.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.783
You'll be swept out of
there pretty quickly.

00:27:16.783 --> 00:27:19.030
That's why the field
reaches a maximum right here

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.730
in the middle.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.220
So that intuitively
makes a lot of sense.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.260
Now, if we take one further
integral of the electric field,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.340
here the electric
field, arc psi.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.020
If we integrate our arc psi,
we will get the potential.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.500
And this potential right
here essentially follows

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.830
this wave-like
curve, where you have

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.970
a lower potential on
this side and a higher

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.460
potential on that side.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.570
And if we take this potential
and translate it into something

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.580
that we can understand,
which is electron energy,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.790
by multiplying the
potential by q.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.150
And q in the case of an
electron is a negative number.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.614
That's why we're flipping this.

00:27:57.614 --> 00:27:59.030
So we're flipping
this upside down

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.738
because we're multiplying
this value here

00:28:00.738 --> 00:28:02.180
by a negative number.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.200
Now, what we can
see is that there's

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.590
an energy gain for the electron
by going from the p-side

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.380
to the n-side.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.870
This is the electron energy.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.780
Obviously, if you give
them an opportunity,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.310
all the electrons would want
to come down to this side.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.944
But why wouldn't all of
them come down over here?

00:28:21.944 --> 00:28:23.282
AUDIENCE: Because of diffusion.

00:28:23.282 --> 00:28:24.615
PROFESSOR: Because of diffusion.

00:28:24.615 --> 00:28:26.670
So there's that balance
of the two effects.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.360
So there is a net energy
gain for the electrons,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.426
but diffusion is what's
driving some of the electrons

00:28:32.426 --> 00:28:34.300
back across the other
side of the junction is

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.340
that equilibrium, which is
establishing the final energy

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.660
band diagram of the pn-junction,
which is really looking

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.950
something very much like that.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:49.220
So this right here describes
for you how you go from atoms

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.240
and charge carriers
up at the top

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.450
to charge distribution, electric
field, potential, and finally

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.980
electron energy.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.006
Yes.

00:28:58.006 --> 00:28:59.683
AUDIENCE: Are
these four diagrams

00:28:59.683 --> 00:29:01.615
specifically for electrons?

00:29:04.513 --> 00:29:07.411
Would the hole
ones be [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:08.860
the reverse of that?

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.150
PROFESSOR: So if you wanted to
look in terms of hole energy,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.690
this equation here
would be equally valid,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.441
but your charge would
be a positive value.

00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:20.023
And so you'd have a curve that
looked very similar to this one

00:29:20.023 --> 00:29:22.560
right here, where there'd be a
net energy gain for the holes

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.360
to go on to the other side.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.980
And that's what establishes
the separation of charge.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.890
AUDIENCE: So the bottom one is
the only one that would change

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:31.547
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:31.547 --> 00:29:32.630
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.250
Yep.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.569
Everything else identical.

00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:37.360
So this is important,
this electron energy.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.380
And this jump right here
confuses a lot of folks.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.290
Because in books, they don't
often describe very clearly

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.030
what is potential
and what is energy,

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.230
almost using those two
terms interchangeably.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.850
But it's that cue, the
fact that the electron has

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.560
a negative charge that
sets things right.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.640
OK, this is pretty important.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.330
This is the foundation,
the fundamental,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.440
of how a pn-junction
comes into being.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.920
And the summary of
our understanding

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.550
so far is that when
the light-- here we go.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.850
When light creates an
electron-hole pair,

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.360
a pn-junction can separate the
positive and negative charges

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.660
because of the built-in
electric field.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.332
Let me repeat that
one more time.

00:30:17.332 --> 00:30:19.040
When light creates an
electron-hole pair,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.675
a pn-junction
potentially can separate

00:30:20.675 --> 00:30:22.050
the positive and
negative charges

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.150
because of that
built-in electric field.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.040
For very small
light intensities,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.870
very small light
intensities, such

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.770
that you can think of that
photo-generated carrier

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.330
as a perturbation to the
system, not fundamentally

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.526
altering the energy levels
yet-- it does eventually happen.

00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.150
But if you have, say,
one photon coming

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.880
into your material
exciting electron

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.690
over here, that
electron can move down,

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.010
can be swept out of
the device, because

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.370
of that built-in electric field.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.600
Again, assuming that we
have a very small impact

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.260
on the electrostatic
[INAUDIBLE] system

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.880
that it's just a
small perturbation,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.840
maybe one single
electron in our system

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.330
is not going to affect you
much because we have 10

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.560
to the 23 or so atoms
per cubic centimeter.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.980
We have a very small
perturbation to our system,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.496
that charge carrier will
be swept out very quickly.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:15.245
The built-in electric
field is established

00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:19.310
at a pn-junction because of the
balance of electron and hole

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.330
drift and diffusion currents.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.000
Let me be more precise about
this one point right here.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.010
Because the built-in
electric field

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.240
is established at a
pn-junction because

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.198
of the balance of electron
drift and diffusion.

00:31:28.198 --> 00:31:29.290
We talked about that.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:31.500
But hole drift and
diffusion as well.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.040
So if you go back over to here,
notice how the electron drift

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.970
and diffusion are opposed and
equal and opposite to the hole

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.570
diffusion and drift.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.960
So let's think about it
from this perspective

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.190
right back here.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.890
This is clear, our
electron diffusion

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.600
is going in that
direction because we

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.183
have a high concentration
of electrons

00:31:52.183 --> 00:31:54.550
that tend to move toward the
low-concentration regime.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.770
So our electron
diffusion current

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.840
is pointing toward the left.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.290
Our hole diffusion current
is pointing to the right.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:06.510
And the hole drift current,
because of this built-in field,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.570
is pointing opposite
the hole diffusion.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.400
So the hole drift current
will be pointing to the left.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.330
Whereas, the electron
drift current

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.010
would be pointing to the right.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.101
So we have, in total,
four currents here.

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.350
The way to think about it
would be, for example, let's

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.660
take the electrons first.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.850
Electron drift or electron
diffusion and drift counteract.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.660
And then you can take the holes.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.190
Hole diffusion and
drift counteract.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.480
They're all balanced.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.400
And this is resulting in
zero net current flow when

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.930
you have no illumination and
no external field applied

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.308
to that device.

00:32:41.308 --> 00:32:44.275
That's pretty nifty.

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:46.150
So the built-in electric
field is established

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.420
at the pn-junction because
of the balance of drift

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.820
and diffusion current for
both electrons and holes.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.840
So we have a small
in-class exercise.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.780
I'd like you to take out these.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.756
And I'd like you
to work in pairs.

00:33:00.756 --> 00:33:02.880
So that if anybody reaches
a small stumbling block,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.440
you can help each other
work through the problems.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.510
So first off, let's focus on
this upper left-hand portion

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.700
right here as shown right there.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.700
This is a replica of
the sheet that you

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.550
should have in front of you.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.720
So what we're doing is we're
dividing-- we're considering

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.990
the pn-junction under no bias.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.730
That means that we're
not applying a battery

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.200
to our pn-junction.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.920
So we have a pn-junction and
we don't attach a battery

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.420
in series.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.690
We just have the pn-junction
under zero bias conditions.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.390
So the way we'd represent that
in that equivalent or model

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.990
circuit diagram
right here is notice

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.710
how we have these
little lines extending

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.230
from the p- and the
n-regions and going above.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.246
Those represent the
external circuit outside

00:33:46.246 --> 00:33:47.120
of the actual device.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.510
The device would be
this one right here

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.490
where we have p and our n.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.490
We have our positive
and negative charges

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.340
here representing the
charges that have built up

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.380
in that space charge
region that are creating

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.707
the built-in electric field.

00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:03.040
And under no bias conditions--
I'll give you the answer.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.340
It's pretty straightforward.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.820
We would just draw
a straight line

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.810
across right there bridging that
external circuit because there

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.139
is no external bias.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.300
There is no battery applied.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.650
And so from an energy band
diagram, e versus x, for e

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.420
being the electron
energy in this case.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.170
And our p-type material
being on this side

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.280
and our n-type material
being on that side,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.630
let's draw the energy band
diagram, just like we've done

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.949
or we've alluded to so far.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:32.120
Sketch out the energy band
diagram for this pn-junction.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.440
And I'll give you a hint.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.320
It's going to look something
very similar to that right

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.960
there, except that you'll
have to take into account both

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.280
the conduction
and valence bands,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.219
because they're both affected
in a similar manner to that.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.030
So why don't you go ahead
and give it your best?

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:53.270
Draw the energy band diagram
in terms of the electron energy

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.590
and position.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.840
Notice your p-type on one
side, n-type on the other.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.120
You can assume that
the point of division

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.599
is like right here
in the middle.

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.140
And for those who
are a little quick,

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.080
you can go on and draw
the relative magnitudes

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.802
of electron drift and
diffusion currents.

00:35:06.802 --> 00:35:08.760
So why don't we give that
a quick, little shot?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.840
Maybe 30 seconds to think
about it and another 30 seconds

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.110
to draw and chat over
it with your colleagues.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.650
So we want to draw
the band diagram,

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.880
just to make sure
everybody's in the same page.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.255
So we're going to
be starting out

00:35:27.255 --> 00:35:32.820
with our valence band and our
conduction band over here.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.550
And as we move toward
our space charge region,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.700
as we move toward our depletion
region, our transition region

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.780
here in the middle, we're
going to see some effect.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.910
We're going to see some bending
of the bands, if you will.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.120
So your question
is to figure out,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.800
do the bands do
something like this?

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.480
Or do they do
something like that?

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.210
Do the bands go up
or do they bend down?

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.660
And that should be a
relatively easy copy

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.500
and paste from two slides prior.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.490
The correct answer
is, indeed, we

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.820
have the band bending
down like this.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.510
So we would have the bands
higher on one side, lower

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.740
on the other.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.570
The electron energy is
higher on the p-type side

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.580
than the n-type side.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.246
So if we add one
electron to our system,

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:23.350
for example a
photo-generated carrier

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:26.317
from one photon coming
into our device,

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.150
that electron will have
the natural tendency

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.460
to go onto this side.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.000
It will be swept down.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.470
Note that the net
current flow inside

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.050
of the device, in the absence
of an external excitation,

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.410
like light or a battery pack
over here, an external bias

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.340
voltage source, the net
current flow is zero.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.940
Because electron
diffusion is pointed

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.840
in that direction
and electron drift

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.175
pointed in that direction.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.330
All right, good.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:37:00.240
So now that we've done one
example, I wanted to-- oh,

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.150
one last thing.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.167
So hole diffusion.

00:37:02.167 --> 00:37:03.750
So this is electron
diffusion pointing

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.050
to the left and electron
drift pointing to the right.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.210
Hole diffusion is pointing
to the right and hole

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.500
drift pointing to the
left as one might expect.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:17.060
Let's try these two right now,
forward bias and reverse bias.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.380
And your trick is to
figure out, if you

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.920
have a battery for instance,
if the battery looks like this.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.460
This would be positive
terminal and negative terminal.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.800
If you have a battery,
which way would you

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.970
align the battery to induce a
forward bias or reverse bias?

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.220
It's perhaps a little
bit beyond my expectation

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.440
of what you would get.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440
Let me add that for you.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.070
Let me just give that
to you right here.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.653
The forward bias
would look like that.

00:37:42.653 --> 00:37:44.590
The reverse bias
would look like that.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.180
OK.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.720
And now the big question is,
what do the band diagrams

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.220
look like?

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.710
How would these look?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:59.270
If we forward bias, if we
forward bias our device

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.929
and we inject electrons
into this side right here,

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:03.220
what would happen to our bands?

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.678
What would you
expect would happen?

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.560
We'll prove this out
in the next few slides,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.029
but I want to see how
people's intuition is

00:38:14.029 --> 00:38:14.820
doing this morning.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.410
So as you bias a device,
you're shifting one level

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:27.332
relative to the other.

00:38:27.332 --> 00:38:29.540
And so the basic question
that you have to answer is,

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.370
should it shift up or
should it shift down under

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.410
Forward and reverse
bias conditions?

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.134
Spend a minute.

00:38:37.134 --> 00:38:38.050
Talk to your neighbor.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.630
Discuss it.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.620
All right, folks.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.814
Why don't we tie it in?

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:49.350
We should be able to
get band diagrams that

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.750
look something like that.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.260
I saw several of you
have already begun

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.520
reaching this consensus here.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.702
Rationale?

00:38:56.702 --> 00:38:58.160
An easy way to
think about this is,

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.618
if our battery is aligned with
our pn-junction in that way,

00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:02.740
and we're injecting
electrons into one side,

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.140
we then have a large
electron diffusion current.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.450
We have the bands shifting
in this direction.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.600
Now the barrier, the energy
barrier for the electrons

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.810
to overcome, to go from the
region of high concentration

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.680
to the region of low
concentration, is smaller.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.930
And you'll get a larger
diffusion current as a result.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.480
More electrons will be moving
over that n-type silicon

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.110
into the p-type silicon.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.090
And the drift current
will be smaller.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.600
Notice here, the balance of the
two, if you add them together,

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.020
you have a net electron flow
in that direction, which

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.910
means you have a
net current flow

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.870
as defined by the flow
of positive charges

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.346
in the other direction.

00:39:37.346 --> 00:39:39.380
A lot of definitions
to keep straight.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.770
Whereas, under reverse bias
here, you're shifting the bands

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.490
like so.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.240
Because you have the
large electric field,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.720
the drift current will be
increased, but only slightly.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.080
Because there's a limited
number of carriers here

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.070
that you can pull from
the p-type material.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.750
And the diffusion current is
going to be drastically reduced

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.070
because now the energy barrier
is so large that the electrons

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.470
have a very hard time getting
from the n-type material

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.010
into the p-type material.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.910
And then that net current flow
is in the opposite direction.

00:40:13.374 --> 00:40:15.040
Does this make intuitive
sense to folks?

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.540
Ashley.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.655
AUDIENCE: So when you touch
the battery [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:21.655 --> 00:40:26.027
is the minus side injecting
electrons [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:26.027 --> 00:40:26.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.900
So in between these
two, the easiest way

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.920
to go from battery to
electron energy band diagram

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.841
is to follow the same sequence
that we did over here.

00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:39.590
And if you're thinking
battery, and you're

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.173
thinking positive
and negative, you're

00:40:41.173 --> 00:40:45.160
shifting the potential of one
side relative to the other.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.336
Then, take that potential shift
and flip it for the electron.

00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:53.380
AUDIENCE: I follow why the
diagrams are the way they are.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.750
But is it conceptually accurate
to think of the negative side

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.628
as putting more electrons
into the n-side?

00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:02.530
PROFESSOR: One could.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.750
AUDIENCE: Like
injecting carriers?

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:04.390
PROFESSOR: The way
I prefer to think

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.230
about it is that you're
changing the energy

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.500
levels, the potential one
relative to the other.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.780
And as a consequence, you
have more electrons flowing

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.420
from that n-side to the p-side.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.050
And that's what's pulling the
current through the circuit.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.100
It's almost a tail wagging
dog, dog wagging tail.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.250
But I would take a
slight preference

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.360
toward understanding it from
the perspective of if you change

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.206
the potential one
relative to the other,

00:41:30.206 --> 00:41:31.580
and allow for a
greater diffusion

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:35.250
current, that motion of
electrons, the electron moving

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.880
from here to here,
will pull current

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.490
through the entire circuit.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.110
And that's what you'll be
measuring with your external--

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.110
essentially, all of the
electrons in the circuit

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.708
are moving through.

00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:50.398
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so
we've opposed the field that

00:41:50.398 --> 00:41:51.469
was set up [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:52.260
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.968
We are opposing the
field that was set up

00:41:53.968 --> 00:41:56.900
by the balance of the drift and
diffusion currents initially.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:57.872
Yeah.

00:41:57.872 --> 00:41:59.573
AUDIENCE: Under
the first bias, how

00:41:59.573 --> 00:42:02.732
come the many electrons
in the anti-material

00:42:02.732 --> 00:42:04.676
aren't [INAUDIBLE]
through the entire circuit

00:42:04.676 --> 00:42:06.150
and injected into
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.025
PROFESSOR: Certainly.

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:11.480
So the reverse bias is
such that the battery

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.720
is aligned to prevent that.

00:42:15.977 --> 00:42:17.810
perhaps one simple way
of thinking about it.

00:42:20.029 --> 00:42:22.320
Yeah, I think that would be
the way I would describe it

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.986
most accurately.

00:42:22.986 --> 00:42:26.150
You could-- and you are
dragging some of the electrons

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.770
out through the
external circuit.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:32.940
But what is driving the current
is mostly the drift current.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.790
It's pulling carriers
from-- essentially,

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:35.998
through your external circle.

00:42:35.998 --> 00:42:38.770
Because carriers are moving
from the p-type to the n-type

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.360
and creating that
charge imbalance

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.860
resulting in the drift current.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.730
Why don't we continue
moving on just a little bit

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.960
because we have some nice
demos we'd like to get to.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.920
I do know this is
really, really important.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.030
And I would welcome
you, actually urge you,

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.390
encourage you to come to
some of the office hours

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.160
and our recitation as well.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.890
I'd like to continue
moving forward

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.680
for the benefit of several
of those who may have seen

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.510
similar material in the past.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.820
But let me, before we
move too far ahead,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.690
on our I-V
characteristics, we still

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.560
don't know how to map an I-V
characteristic of that device.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.589
We don't know how the current
voltage, I current V voltage,

00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:21.130
we don't know how
the current voltage

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:24.080
response is going to look like
for that particular device.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.060
But we do know that
under no bias conditions

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.080
we're at bias voltage equals 0.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.450
So V is at 0.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.710
And we know that we have
no net current flow.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.760
And so our current is
going to be at 0 as well.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.850
And so we know that
we're going to have

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:37.360
one point on our
I-V curve that's

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.890
going to be situated at 0, 0.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.990
Likewise, in this
case over here,

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.872
we have electron diffusion
driving the circuit.

00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.830
And in the other, we have
electron drift, which

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.440
is in the opposite direction.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.140
And so you'd expect
that the current flow

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.840
in I under forward bias
conditions-- forward bias is

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.990
positive-- would be
somewhere up here.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.970
And likewise,
under reverse bias,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.970
that our current would
be opposite the sign.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.110
So whereas we had positive
current over here,

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.290
we would expect negative
current over there.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.110
So our I-V
characteristic is going

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.450
to look something like a
combination of one point

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.730
right here and some
function up in this quadrant

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.940
and some function
down in this quadrant,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.090
just by glancing at
the net current flows

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.715
and the type of bias that
we've applied to our diode.

00:44:25.715 --> 00:44:28.920
We'll come back to this
at the end of class

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.100
and confirm it using those
small apparatus over there.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.630
So current flow
in a pn-junction.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.455
We're going to describe the
nature of the drift, diffusion,

00:44:36.455 --> 00:44:38.270
and illumination
currents in a diode.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.317
Show the direction and
magnitude in the dark.

00:44:40.317 --> 00:44:42.150
Eventually, we'll do
this under illumination

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.050
as well, but let's
just focus in the dark.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.800
In fact, we've
already done this.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.510
I've already-- I've
already tricked you

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.370
into doing learning objective
number 3 on your own,

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.339
before even describing the math.

00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:54.630
But I will show you the
mathematics as well so that you

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.480
have the complete picture.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.080
We have the diffusion current.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.800
This is the essence
of diffusion current.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.820
We talked about Fick's
law as well for holes

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.270
and for electrons.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.740
We have our drift current.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.710
We spoke about the nature
of the drift current

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.100
as well for holes and electrons.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.440
And we know that by
combining the two,

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.170
we can describe the net current
flow across a pn-junction.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.830
So by combining the two, by
combining drift and diffusion--

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.870
drift and diffusion for
electrons and holes--

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:25.220
we can describe the current
flow across that pn-junction.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.350
So when the electric
field is large,

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.370
the drift current term
is going to dominate.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.960
If you have a
large field, that's

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.170
going to be the dominant
current source if you will.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.500
And when the electric
field is small,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.560
diffusion is going to dominate.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.380
So if we have a device
like this right here.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.380
And if I told you that the
built-in electric field was

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.075
located pushed up toward
the top 1/100 of the device.

00:45:49.075 --> 00:45:51.830
So it was located very
close to the surface.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.230
You might surmise that
the drift current is going

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.300
to be having a large influence.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.830
If you're a single
electron, you'll

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.790
feel the influence
of the electric field

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.440
near the front
surface of the device.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.480
And deep within the bulk,
the diffusion current

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.830
is going to be driving the
carriers toward that junction.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.700
There's a relationship
between the mobility

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.380
and the diffusivity of carriers.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.870
It's known as the
Einstein relation.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:19.390
And that's given
to you over there

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:22.230
on the right-hand side
for a band conductor.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.610
Note that if you have--
this is an advanced concept.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.430
But if you have a dispersive
hopping mechanism,

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.810
for instance, you may need
to become a little bit more

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.310
sophisticated in how you relate
the diffusivity of a carrier

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.180
to your mobility.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.970
But let's assume that is
valid for nice, well-behaved

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.260
semiconductors.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.312
It's just a warning for those
who work on organic materials.

00:46:41.312 --> 00:46:44.040
I'd be happy to talk to you
more about that in a bit.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.756
So again, we have Gauss' law.

00:46:46.756 --> 00:46:48.630
The question is, what
is that electric field?

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.540
What is arc psi?

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.109
What is our built-in
electric field?

00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:52.650
Well, we know that
the charge density

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:56.340
is going to be comprised
of the free hole

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.940
density, the free electron
density, the fixed

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.854
density of our donor atoms.

00:47:02.854 --> 00:47:04.645
You could think of
these as the phosphorus,

00:47:04.645 --> 00:47:07.890
the ionized phosphorus
atoms, and our fixed density

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.650
of ionized acceptor atoms.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.455
We can also think of this as
our boron atoms and silicon.

00:47:12.455 --> 00:47:15.750
And so that is our fixed--
actually, not our fixed.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.760
These are fixed charges.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.610
These are mobile charges.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.900
But under equilibrium,
they've distributed themselves

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.850
in a certain way.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.950
That is our charge
density, our rho.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.750
And that will figure
into Gauss' law

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.300
and allow us to
calculate arc psi.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.390
And so in summa, we have here
arc psi as a function of dx.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.270
We have an expression that
relates the electric field

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:38.725
to the density of dopant
atoms inside of our material.

00:47:38.725 --> 00:47:41.100
Note that we made one critical
assumption going from here

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.690
to here, where we went from
the ionized donor and acceptor

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.570
concentration to the total
dopant concentration.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.320
We're assuming that
everything is ionized.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.130
Again, because the
ionization energy,

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.220
because the binding energy
of those free carriers

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.190
to their dopant
atoms is so small

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:01.400
that under kt, under thermal
energy at room temperature

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.500
it's enough to
dissociate the charge.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.280
OK, so we've gotten to here.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.440
We can describe quantitatively
using this approximation,

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.170
using the box function
approximation.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:14.870
We can describe the electric
field quantitatively.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.710
And now we have to
get to the potential

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.530
and find the electron
energy as well.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.930
So we do a little
bit of accounting.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.500
If we want to account for
all of the electrons flowing

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.750
through our system,
we would have

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.430
to consider as well, in
any voxel of our material,

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.580
in any unit volume
of our material,

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.420
we have electrons going
in, electrons coming out.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.500
And within it, we could have
electrons being generated,

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.270
say by light, or
electrons recombining.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.060
Meaning they're
losing their energy

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.750
and falling back into a ground
state where they're bound.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.772
And that's this
U-term right here.

00:48:47.772 --> 00:48:49.730
And so the continuity
equations are essentially

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.080
a set of accounting
equations that

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.430
just describe the
difference, the net change,

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.290
going in and out.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.460
If something changes
on either surface,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.110
it's because your either added
carriers or took them away.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.880
And the way you add is by
shining light on your sample

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.120
and generating more carriers.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.480
G, for instance.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.590
That's one way of generating
carriers by adding light.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.020
Or recombination.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.606
And one way of recombining
is, for example,

00:49:13.606 --> 00:49:14.980
through a defect
in our material,

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.070
where the electron
is moving along.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.844
It finds a defect and it falls
back into a ground state.

00:49:19.844 --> 00:49:22.260
So the continuity equations
are nothing more, nothing less

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.310
than housekeeping, bookkeeping.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.630
But it's very important as
you'll see in the next slide

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.670
right here where we
combine five equations that

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.240
describe current transport
in a pn-junction.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.400
We have drift and
diffusion up here.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.120
Those are the
equations we just saw.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.520
We have the equation
describing the electric field.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.460
And we have our accounting
equations down here.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.010
And if we look at these
equations in unison,

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:50.550
we'll notice that, oh, well, we
have our hole current appearing

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:51.530
twice here.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.980
We have our electric field
appearing in two cases.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:55.530
Sorry.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.180
Back.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.620
Back.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.380
There.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.800
We have our electric field
appearing in those three

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.070
equations right here.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.510
And we have a system
of non-linear equations

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:10.200
as a result. It is not possible
to solve these analytically

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:10.980
in their entirety.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.730
We'll have to make a
series of assumptions

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.210
to really get to
the full solution.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.140
But it's possible to
solve them numerically

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.520
using computer simulations.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.930
This is important
because we want

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:25.540
to be able to define the current
coming out of our solar cell

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.090
device.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.840
Without solving these
equations, we really

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.130
don't understand what
the current is out

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:33.110
of a pn-junction, out of a
solar cell under different bias

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:33.670
conditions.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:35.836
That's why these equations
right here are important.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.260
What I want to do is not to
just dwell on the current.

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.110
I want to emphasize
that to calculate

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.230
the voltage across the
semiconductor-- sorry,

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.910
a semiconductor device, a
pn-junction-based solar cell.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.670
To calculate the voltage
across a solar cell,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.660
we have to understand
a little bit more.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:07.810
So far, we've been assuming
that each electron is

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.120
a unique individual.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.980
That an electron over here
is a small perturbation

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.580
to a larger system in
that it will flow down

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.440
based on that electric field.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.150
For a voltage,
we're really talking

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:19.722
about an ensemble of electrons.

00:51:19.722 --> 00:51:21.180
All of the electrons
in the system.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.970
And so we have to define
some chemical potential

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:24.920
for our system.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.510
We have to define
some-- one could

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.090
think of it as an average
energy for our system.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.930
So let me define chemical
potential for you

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.930
in a semiconductor.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.100
If we describe the
semiconductor-- here's

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.110
our valence band and
our conduction band.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:43.270
This is our band gap right
here in between the two bands

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:45.982
as described by e sub g, our
conduction band, valence band.

00:51:45.982 --> 00:51:47.940
And these little red dots
here are representing

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.350
our covalently bonded
electrons in the ground

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.260
state at 0 Kelvin.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.955
If we heat this material
up just a little bit,

00:51:55.955 --> 00:51:57.580
there will be some
fraction of carriers

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.910
moving across into the
conduction band just

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:02.680
through simple probability.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.330
And we'll get to the
precise equation that

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.100
describes the
probability distribution

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.020
function in a few lectures.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.440
But for now, let's just
assume that a certain number

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.600
through thermal
processes are able to be

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.580
excited across the band gap.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.920
So these are
thermally-excited electrons.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.270
And we call these-- this
is the intrinsic carrier

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:23.270
concentration.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.420
So these carriers up here
are free to move around

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.140
the crystal.

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.400
They can conduct electricity.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.654
They can conduct charge.

00:52:28.654 --> 00:52:30.070
We could measure
a current flowing

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.130
through if we applied a
bias voltage across material

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:33.970
like this.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.230
Those are our charge carriers.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:36.500
These holes as well.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.516
And so this is the intrinsic
carrier concentration.

00:52:40.516 --> 00:52:41.890
To give you an
order of magnitude

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.210
of the intrinsic carrier
concentration in silicon,

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.290
it's around 10 to the 10
carriers per cubic centimeter.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:55.180
That's 1 over 10
to the 12 per atom.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:58.680
So each atom of silicon is
generating roughly 1 over 10

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.080
to the 12 free carriers
due to this process.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.520
Very small concentration of
free carriers in the material.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.440
Around 5/10 into the 22
atoms per cubic centimeter

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.660
and only 10 to the 10 free
carriers per cubic centimeter

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.770
due to this thermal process
at room temperature.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:15.410
So it's a very small
effect in silicon.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.579
As you shrink your
band gap, the energy

00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:20.120
necessary to excite
across a band gap

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.630
becomes less since you
have more thermal carriers.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:27.610
So the chemical potential is
describing the average energy

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:30.950
necessary to remove an
infinitesimally small quantity

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.200
of electrons to the system.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.640
And again, infinitesimally
small quantity meaning it's

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.479
a mere perturbation.

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:37.770
You're not changing the volume.

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.680
You're not changing the
electrostatics of the system.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.630
You're just adding one
electron to the system,

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:43.046
or taking it away,
and determining

00:53:43.046 --> 00:53:45.340
how much energy was required.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.030
And so we describe that
chemical potential,

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:49.980
we call it by a different name.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.770
We call it Fermi level, but
it is the exact same thing.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.950
It's the energy necessary
to remove that electron

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.930
from the material.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.740
So you can envision
that it's going

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.320
to be the Fermi level on either
side of the pn-junction that

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.480
will determine the voltage
output of our solar cell

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:05.980
device.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.146
And that's why we want to
be able to calculate this.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.530
So let's look, first off what
happens to our Fermi level

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.850
when we dope our material,
when we intentionally

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.340
add, in this case, boron
atoms to make it p-type

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.980
or phosphorus atoms to
make the material n-type.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.810
What happens?

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.790
Well, we end up
shifting our Fermi level

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.240
toward the valence band
or shifting the Fermi

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.220
level toward the conduction
band by the addition of holes

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.536
or electrons.

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.410
An easy way to think
about it without getting

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.120
into complicated semiconductor
math is the following.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.920
If I'm adding more electrons to
my system, by doping at n-type,

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.507
essentially I'm shifting
the energy level up.

00:54:44.507 --> 00:54:45.965
It's an easy way
to think about it.

00:54:45.965 --> 00:54:47.880
If I'm removing the
electrons from the system

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.710
by adding holes
down here, then I'm

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.630
shifting the Fermi level down.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:53.830
Easy way to think about it.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.110
We'll get to the math.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:56.610
Actually, if you're
really curious,

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.080
I think I included one
slide of the derivation

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.880
of the precise
chemical potential

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.850
so you can walk
through that as well.

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:05.990
So voltage across a pn-junction.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:09.070
Under zero bias conditions,
this is in the dark

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.820
and without a battery
pack attached to it.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.790
So this is an
unperturbed pn-junction

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:19.090
just in the dark without
any external bias.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:23.130
We have the Fermi level
constant throughout.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.920
Both the p-type and
the n-type flat.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.780
Notice the bands are
bending, so the distance

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.960
of the Fermi level
from the valence band

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.640
here is smaller than the
distance from the Fermi level

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.530
to the valence band in
the n-type material.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:36.690
That's because in
the n-type material

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.064
we have more
electrons, and we're

00:55:38.064 --> 00:55:40.570
pushing the Fermi level higher.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.850
The vacuum level
follows these bands.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.722
It just happens to
be way up there.

00:55:45.722 --> 00:55:47.680
And so the amount of
energy necessary to remove

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.480
the electron from the system,
to move it to the vacuum level,

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.680
changes from the
p-type to the n-type.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.480
But for the purposes
of our diagram right

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.140
here, we're drawing the Fermi
level constant throughout.

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.030
Now, we have that transition
region, the depletion region,

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.950
the space charge region--
all anonymous, same thing.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:08.100
We have that transition
region here in the middle.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.300
So if we begin quantifying
the different parameters here,

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.350
we have a Fermi level distance
from the valence band.

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.987
So that's this
distance right here.

00:56:16.987 --> 00:56:18.820
We have the distance
between the Fermi level

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.130
and the conduction band
in the n-type material.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:24.040
And then we have our
built-in potential.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.220
And when we multiply our
built-in potential by q,

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.085
we get an energy.

00:56:28.085 --> 00:56:32.600
Essentially, an energy gain
across that pn-junction.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.801
So that quantity here is equal
to the band gap minus these two

00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:37.300
parameters.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.230
Minus this, minus that.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.200
And so you can see that
the built-in potential

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.392
across the junction is
benefited by higher doping.

00:56:45.392 --> 00:56:47.100
The higher we dope
our material, the more

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.680
we shift our Fermi level
toward either band.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.630
And the greater the
separation we get,

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.750
the smaller this quantity is,
the smaller that quantity is,

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.900
and the more our built-in
potential approximates

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.240
the actual band gap
of the material.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.524
This built-in potential
will relate to-- it

00:57:02.524 --> 00:57:03.940
wont' be identical
to, but it will

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.760
be associated with
our maximum voltage

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.737
that we can get
out of the device.

00:57:08.737 --> 00:57:11.070
And so we'll want to engineer
our material in such a way

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:13.180
so as to maximize that quantity.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.750
That's important.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:20.010
The relation between our
built-in potential and the dope

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.530
intensity is shown here.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.430
For now, you'll have
to take my word for it.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.170
I'm sparing you a lot of
semiconductor physics.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.170
It's written on the next
slide right here if you

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:30.130
care to look in some detail.

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.000
It's also described in,
I believe, Chapter 2

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.290
in Martin Green's textbook.

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:37.015
But for now, let's assume that
the built-in junction potential

00:57:37.015 --> 00:57:39.170
is a function of the
dopant concentrations

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:40.499
just by our intuition.

00:57:40.499 --> 00:57:42.290
If we're adding more
electrons to one side,

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:45.960
we're going to be shifting
the Fermi energy up.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.760
OK, so the voltage
across a pn-junction.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.320
Now, let's bias our device.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.400
We have under zero bias
conditions this expression.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.550
Sorry, there we go.

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.200
Under zero bias conditions,
we have that expression there.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.020
And under biased
conditions, now we

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.700
have an applied biased
voltage, our V sub a.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.070
We're applying a bias voltage.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.130
We've effectively
shifted-- notice here,

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.870
we've shifted our bands
when relative to the other.

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.340
So we've shifted this side
up by a certain V sub a.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.510
And now if you'll notice
the quantities here,

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.320
we have a separation
of the Fermi energy

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.620
on one side to the other.

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.610
There is a bias now
across this device.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:31.270
There is a driving
force for electrons

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.230
to go and complete an
external circuit, to travel

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.570
through the external circuit.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.028
Because the electrons
that are over

00:58:37.028 --> 00:58:40.390
here have a higher energy net
than the electrons over there--

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:43.640
the ensemble, on average.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.529
The transition region,
likewise, will get smaller.

00:58:47.529 --> 00:58:48.570
Sorry for that animation.

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:51.460
But if we keep track here,
the transition region

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.800
becomes smaller
under forward bias.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.049
Because we're depleting-- we're
removing the amount of charge

00:58:58.049 --> 00:58:58.840
that was over here.

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.130
We're squeezing it back.

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.030
We're reducing that
barrier height.

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:06.490
And so over here, if we
go back to this diagram,

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.140
you can now draw in what's
written in these red circles.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.620
You can draw in the
actual depletion

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:17.040
width, the width of the space
charge region on your diagrams,

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.630
just like that.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.920
I'll give you just a second to
complete that diagram there.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.840
Under reverse bias, likewise,
the width of the depletion

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.715
region will increase.

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:38.390
And the depletion
region is increasing,

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:39.950
the built-in charge
is increasing,

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:41.815
the amount of band
bending is increasing,

00:59:41.815 --> 00:59:44.450
and the amount of drift
current also increasing.

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.610
So it all fits together.

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.490
It's beginning to really
come together nicely in one

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:50.720
nice picture in our minds.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.028
So yes, one question.

00:59:55.028 --> 00:59:57.134
AUDIENCE: So I understand
that for our solar cell,

00:59:57.134 --> 01:00:01.019
we wouldn't want to actually
use a battery to drive current.

01:00:01.019 --> 01:00:03.310
PROFESSOR: Let's get to
illuminated current next class.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.580
For now, we'll just
focus on the battery.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.080
Yeah.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.500
AUDIENCE: So should we
not quite yet understand

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.129
why forward bias and reverse
bias applies to [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.920
PROFESSOR: Let's leave
that for next class.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.407
For now, let's assume that the
illumination current-- if you

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:20.990
really want to satisfy
your curiosity,

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.656
your illumination
current is going to be

01:00:22.656 --> 01:00:24.070
one additional arrow to this.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.320
It's going to be in addition
to everything else that's

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.220
going on.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.900
But the majority of
the field is going

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.280
to be created by what is
doped into the material.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.490
So think of the
illumination for now

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.492
as a small perturbation
to the system.

01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:39.200
That's the easiest
way to think about it.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.800
To justify to
yourself why we need

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.760
to understand first the
solar cell in the dark,

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.090
and then because of
that small perturbation,

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:49.590
we can treat it as a linear
superposition of effects.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.850
And we'll add the
illumination next class.

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.969
But bear with me
in the dark first.

01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:55.760
Because if we really
don't understand this,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.218
we're not going to
understand fully

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:59.670
how the solar cell operates
in the light either.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.590
So next, we'll draw
the I-V response.

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.400
We'll want to really
get to this last point

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.860
right here where we can draw
the current voltage response.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.130
And we want to recognize
that minority carrier flux is

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.070
what's regulating the current.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.050
So to do this well,
to do this properly,

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:18.690
we have to shift
our focus from here

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:20.480
where we were talking
about ensembles

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.090
and individual particles.

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:25.870
Here we're going
to be discussing

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:30.160
in terms of carrier densities
on either side of the junction.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.440
Densities of
electrons and holes.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.940
And unfortunately,
I'm going to have

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.880
to move rather quickly
through these slides.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.360
This is the essence of
why a solar cell behaves

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.440
like a diode.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.180
And it's really
something that is best

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.830
done by studying on your own.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:48.440
I'm happy to walk you through
the most salient points,

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.610
the most important
approximations

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.200
that we have along the
way, but this is best

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.460
understood by going
home, looking up

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.590
the readings on stellar, and
walking through the derivation

01:01:58.590 --> 01:01:59.290
yourself.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.910
It's not something
that very easily I

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:05.160
can convey a series of
equations in the class.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.930
So before we go into
detail into current flows,

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:13.074
I wanted to touch on this
with the space charge region.

01:02:13.074 --> 01:02:15.240
We can describe the width
of the space charge region

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.410
now by the built-in bias
across the junction.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:22.560
The applied bias right here
and some fundamental material

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.400
properties as well.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.230
And this little
epsilon right here

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:31.340
is essentially the dielectric
constant and the vacuum

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.822
permittivity, a constant.

01:02:32.822 --> 01:02:34.530
And so you want to
take that into account

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.610
when you're running your
actual calculations.

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.540
It's very easy to be off on
the width of the space charge

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.470
region by several
orders of magnitude

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:46.060
if you don't do the proper
accounting for those fixed

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.030
variables.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.110
And so if you walk
through the equations

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:51.550
to describe the width of
the space charge region,

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:54.140
you'll find that in a
typical solar cell device,

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.422
it's on the order of a micron.

01:02:55.422 --> 01:02:57.630
And this is related to one
of your homework problems,

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.230
so stash that away
somewhere in your brain.

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.569
It's on the order of a micron.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.110
The width of that
space charge region

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:05.380
typically could
be on that order.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.965
So it's going to
be some multiple.

01:03:07.965 --> 01:03:09.340
And the reason
that's interesting

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.280
is because the entire
solar cell device

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.110
is about 100 to 200 microns.

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.590
That's for a crystalline
silicon device.

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:20.590
That means that in a
crystalline silicon device,

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:23.090
the diffusion current
is what's driving

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.730
most of the current flow
inside of the solar cell.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.740
If our solar cell is
much, much, much thinner,

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.470
say in the order of a micron,
then our drift current

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:32.026
would be dominating.

01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:33.650
This is a more advanced
topic and we'll

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.608
return to that when we
describe the differences

01:03:35.608 --> 01:03:38.400
between thin film operation and
crystalline silicon solar cell

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.760
operation.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.060
Device capacitance.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.320
For those who are running
experimental measurements

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.890
and want to determine
the RC time constant

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:52.920
necessary to have the device
settle into a measurable state,

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.480
that's there.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.060
And the capacitance
is described, again,

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.500
by the various
properties as well as

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.140
the built-in potential which is
related to the dopant density.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.810
OK, so under zero bias,
we have a concentration

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.292
of holes on one side of
our junction that's high.

01:04:10.292 --> 01:04:12.750
In the p-type material, the
concentration of holes is high.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.690
And it's approximately equal
to the acceptor concentration.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.620
On the n-type side
of our junction,

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.730
the whole population
is drastically reduced.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.480
And the flip side, our electron
concentration is very high

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.877
and it drops into
the p-type side.

01:04:27.877 --> 01:04:29.710
So we have predominately
holes on this side.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.470
Predominately
electrons in that side.

01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:35.330
But a small concentration
of holes on the n-type side

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:38.220
and a small concentration of
electrons in the p-type side.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.730
And we call this the
minority carrier.

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.340
And we call that the
majority carrier.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.100
The majority carrier
is in the majority.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.220
The minority carrier
in the minority.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.890
And an interesting thing
happens when we bias our device.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.580
When we bias our
solar cell device,

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.360
populations of both
carriers increase.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.070
But because this
is on a log scale,

01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:00.510
we're increasing this-- shall
we say the minority carrier

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:04.610
concentration in an
absolute sense by a lot.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:08.240
And it's because of this drastic
uptick in the minority carrier

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.060
concentration right at the
edge of the space charge region

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.380
that we have current flow
across that junction.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:19.520
And that's described by a
series of equations here.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.420
Let's see, the way to walk
through the derivation,

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.860
there's a series of
approximations to make.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:29.010
Think of it in terms of
electron and hole fluxes

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.590
on either side of the junction.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:33.090
You can make a series of
assumptions as to what currents

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:34.574
matter and which don't.

01:05:34.574 --> 01:05:36.240
You can, of course,
make the assumptions

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.060
as to the charge
distribution as well,

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.940
fixed using that box potential.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.830
And you can consider the cases
in which the minority carrier

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:49.430
concentration here is dominating
to be the regions of interest

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:52.380
for a current generation
inside of our device.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.500
And so if we walk through,
again the diffusion equation,

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.360
the diffusion of carriers
at the edge of the space

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.700
charge region.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.520
And from the
previous slides here,

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.810
add our approximations
in, we will ultimately

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:08.760
derive an expression that
has an exponential relation

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.590
between current and our voltage.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:16.200
And if we continue through
the series of calculations,

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.100
including the continuity
equation for accountability,

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.950
we wind up with
an expression that

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:23.670
looks like this right here,
where the total current flowing

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:27.466
through the device will be
equal to the electron current

01:06:27.466 --> 01:06:29.340
at the edge of our space
charge region coming

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.370
from the p-type side.

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.000
The hole concentration
coming from the n-type side.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.660
The addition of
the two together.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.700
And that's effectively,
this equation right here,

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.880
where we have an exponential
relation between current

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.590
and voltage.

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:50.610
So again, this we really
need to go home and study.

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.894
And if you'd like to
do this pictorially,

01:06:52.894 --> 01:06:54.560
I provide you with
that link right there

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.930
so you can see it visually.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:00.120
If you're more of a math type,
Chapters 3 and 4-- actually,

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.580
Chapter 4 in Martin Green is
probably the best place to go.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.400
And the important
thing to keep in mind

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.784
is that in the pn-junction,
the current flow

01:07:08.784 --> 01:07:10.200
across that junction
is determined

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.830
by the minority carrier current
flow at the edge of the space

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.380
charge region.

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.460
And that's why we wind up
with the exponential relation

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.060
between voltage and current.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.000
I decided the best
way to emphasize

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.540
this voltage-current relation
is actually to measure it,

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.710
to run it.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:28.700
To do it.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.330
And we have around 10 minutes
left before the end of class.

01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:33.110
Do you think that is
time for our demo?

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:33.960
Cutting it kind of short.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.220
AUDIENCE: Probably
wait for Tuesday.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.261
PROFESSOR: Probably wait
for Tuesday on the demo.

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:38.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.650
PROFESSOR: So we're going
to run the demos on Tuesday,

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:41.629
I suppose.

01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:43.670
Because we're running a
little bit short on time.

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:45.128
I know David is
really disappointed

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:46.830
because he's been
working hard to get

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.980
these in perfect
ship-shape condition.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.756
But we'll have
another couple of days

01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:52.630
to work out some of the
bugs in the software,

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.463
so we don't need to
restart it every time we

01:07:54.463 --> 01:07:57.224
take a new I-V measurement.

01:07:57.224 --> 01:07:58.640
But by and large,
what we'll do is

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.490
we'll measure the
current voltage relation

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:03.380
for a real solar cell device.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.660
And we'll see that it
definitely does follow,

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:08.150
at least under forward
bias conditions,

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.600
this exponential relation.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.280
So as v goes forward,
as v-- this v over here

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.490
is our applied bias condition.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:19.890
As our v increases, we have
that exponential current output

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:21.120
from our device.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.700
As v goes towards
a negative number,

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.779
we have pretty much a flat
lining of our current.

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:30.314
It goes into a slightly negative
condition and a flat lining

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:30.939
of the current.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:37.109
So if we look at this again
right here, our I versus V,

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:40.160
now we can plot
the same equation.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.460
Or essentially, the same
curve on all three of these.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.180
We'll want to plot the same
curve-- this one over here.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.520
And for now, let's assume
that this big lump over here

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.517
is a constant.

01:08:51.517 --> 01:08:54.100
And so we just need to plot an
exponential function, something

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.580
similar to this right here.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.399
And under zero bias conditions,
we'll be right there at 0, 0.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.729
Under forward bias conditions
will be further up.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:06.040
And the reverse bias
conditions will be down there.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.370
And let me give you a second
just to draw this down.

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:12.410
And please do.

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:15.090
We'll be validating it
to ourselves on Tuesday.

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:17.939
My sincere apologies for not
having enough time to really

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:21.120
go into the demos as well.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.479
But suffice to
say the following.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:25.189
Under forward bias
conditions, when

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:28.260
we reduce the barrier
height between the n-

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.710
and the p-type side, we're now
allowing that diffusion current

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.590
from the n to the
p to take over.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:37.470
And as we reduce the barrier
more and more and more,

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:40.770
we have this exponentially
increasing density of electrons

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:43.760
flowing through our system.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.390
And that's why we have this
exponentially increasing

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.109
curve here.

01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:51.700
As we reverse bias--
our device, we're

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.323
increasing the barrier height
for the electrons to pass over.

01:09:55.323 --> 01:10:00.080
So our diffusion current
practically vanishes.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.570
And our drift current
stays, more or less,

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:05.300
constant all the way
throughout because there's only

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.100
a finite carrier density,
a finite minority carrier

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.510
concentration inside
of the p-type silicon.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.534
The thermally excited
carriers for instance,

01:10:12.534 --> 01:10:14.700
that are finding their way
to the junction and being

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.830
drifted across.

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:18.370
And that concentration
is virtually finite.

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.560
At some point, you'll
reverse bias this so much

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.850
that the carriers will
begin tunneling across

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:27.740
from the valence band into
the conduction band over here

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:30.640
and you'll have a catastrophic
failure of your device,

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:33.237
but that's more of
an advanced point.

01:10:33.237 --> 01:10:33.737
Yeah.

01:10:33.737 --> 01:10:37.550
AUDIENCE: So does the x indicate
the coordinate of I and V

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:38.360
at steady state?

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.390
PROFESSOR: So the
entire line represents

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:44.860
the I-V characteristic
under all biased conditions.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:49.150
The x represents the
current and voltage

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:52.920
for this particular operating
point on the solar cell.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.190
On the I-V characteristic.

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:55.980
So if you're under
forward bias condition.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.110
In other words,
your v is positive,

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:01.340
you will have a positive current
flow through your device.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.490
Positive current flow,
electrons flowing that way.

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.580
And under reverse bias,
notice the sign of the current

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.925
is flipped because
now the electrons used

01:11:09.925 --> 01:11:10.800
to be going that way.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.100
The electrons are predominately
moving the other direction.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.280
The net current flow is
in the opposite direction.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.570
And the voltage is
also changing sign.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.212
AUDIENCE: You can
say, OK, I'm going

01:11:20.212 --> 01:11:21.779
to put myself in this voltage?

01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:22.570
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.150
And that's important
because we want

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.876
to be able to describe
what our current voltage

01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:29.250
characteristic is
of a solar cell

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:32.000
because the product of
the two is the power.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.200
For efficiency, we want
to know what the power out

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.429
of our solar cell is.

01:11:35.429 --> 01:11:37.220
And it's the product
of current and voltage

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:41.560
that will give us the power
of our solar cell device.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.830
Time for a few
questions, actually.

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:47.940
About five minutes of Q&A
since we had to forgo the demo.

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.020
Promise me you'll do one thing.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.620
Promise me you'll go home.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.750
And sometime between
now and Tuesday, you're

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.620
going to read through
these chapters

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.630
and do the derivations
that will work

01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:15.280
through to this ideal
diode equation right here.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.800
Because this is
pretty important.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.820
And you have to
convince yourself

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.180
that that's indeed the case.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.970
I can wave my hands
and phenomenologically

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.680
describe, OK, we have
an energy barrier.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.430
I kind of get it.

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.950
I should have an
exponential probability

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:28.595
of passing over
an energy barrier.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.970
At least from quantum mechanics
that kind of makes sense.

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:33.350
So I kind of get how if
I forward bias my device,

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:38.630
I'll have an exponentially
increasing diffusion current.

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.750
I get that if I go into
reverse bias conditions,

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:44.430
there's just a finite density
of carriers, minority carriers,

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:45.730
in my p-type material.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:48.050
If I'm not, say, shining
a light on the material,

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:50.480
I'm not changing that
concentration by much.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.080
And I'm going to flat line.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.415
Yes, they'll be drifting
across, but they'll

01:12:55.415 --> 01:12:59.660
be limited more by their
ability to reach the junction.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:03.650
You can hand wave all you want,
but this is really-- whoopsie--

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:07.800
the equations that describe
the ideal diode equation.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.634
Those are really where it's at.

01:13:09.634 --> 01:13:11.050
With that equation,
you can really

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:13.540
understand how material
properties will

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.670
impact solar cell
performance, let's say.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.705
Yes, question?

01:13:16.705 --> 01:13:19.675
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the band diagrams.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:27.100
For all three diagrams, the
energy levels [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.090
the same.

01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:31.060
We're just changing
where the n-type side is.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.040
Both of them [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.968
Yep, absolutely.

01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:41.170
The point was here, what we've
done for simplicity is shifting

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:42.470
one side relative to the other.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.100
Yeah.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.180
In energy-- see,
energy is a funny thing

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.970
because you can
redefine your zero.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:53.470
Yeah.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.370
So depending on where you're
defining your zero point at,

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:58.220
you can move things
relative to each other.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.220
But let's assume
that you're changing

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.420
both sides relative to
some universal ground

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.830
potential that's off on
an external component

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:08.606
of your circuit.

01:14:08.606 --> 01:14:09.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:27.072 --> 01:14:28.530
PROFESSOR: That's
a great question.

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:31.519
So the question was, when
you dope your material, what

01:14:31.519 --> 01:14:33.060
are the experimental
methods that you

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.620
can use to really
determine whether or not

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:40.110
the atoms have occupied a
substitutional position?

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:43.930
One of the methods is called
Rutherford backscattering

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:47.260
or channeling, IN channeling,
where you introduce ions

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.320
down your lattice.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.360
And if there is an
atom here, for example,

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.330
an interstitial
site, it will scatter

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.680
some fraction of those
introduced ions back

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.590
at the detector.

01:14:56.590 --> 01:15:01.460
And so channeling is one
characterization method

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.310
for determining the interstitial
to substitutional ratio inside

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:09.420
of a semiconducting material.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:13.350
Another way that we have
very strong evidence

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:15.942
that boron is occupying a
substitutional site and not

01:15:15.942 --> 01:15:21.000
an interstitial site is we can
calculate the binding energy

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.890
of this hole to
the boron atom here

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:24.620
on the substitutional site.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.610
In principle, if the
interstitial was also--

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:28.840
if it was a charge
to defect, we could

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.190
calculate the binding energy
of the charge to that defect.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:35.840
And the density
functional theory

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.770
could tell you which
is the more likely

01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.750
given your experimental
observation that you

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.280
get about one hole for every
one boron anatomy inside

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.359
of your sample.

01:15:43.359 --> 01:15:45.150
Boron has been studied
to death in silicon.

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:47.150
It's pretty well-known
that it's substitutional.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:49.580
But if you're working with a
new semiconducting material,

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.640
you never know.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.973
You have to run the experiments.

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.978
Yeah, question.

01:15:56.978 --> 01:16:01.768
AUDIENCE: Under bias
[INAUDIBLE] diagrams, are the p-

01:16:01.768 --> 01:16:04.642
and n-sides far away
from the [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:04.642 --> 01:16:07.050
Are those bands actually--
do they actually

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:10.584
have a slope to them because
of the applied field?

01:16:10.584 --> 01:16:11.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:15.880
So the question was far away
from the space charge region

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.950
here, do these
bands have a slope?

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:21.730
My argument would be that
if we go back to the way

01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:24.830
we derive-- there we go.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.100
The way we derive this
band to begin with,

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.790
it's predicated upon an electric
field, which is predicated

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:31.430
upon a charge distribution.

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:34.390
So the biggest question is,
what does this real charge

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.970
distribution look like?

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.370
Most of the time,
it's relatively

01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:41.980
concentrated to the near
space charge region.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.280
If you get too far away, OK,
yes, it decays exponentially.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.970
But it falls below the
background intrinsic carrier

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:51.464
concentration and
effectively doesn't matter.

01:16:51.464 --> 01:16:54.370
AUDIENCE: Under applied
bias, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:55.142
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:16:55.142 --> 01:16:57.100
AUDIENCE: Usually they're
just drawing it flat,

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.500
but is it such a small
effect they're just

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.950
drawing it flat [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:01.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.530
So under applied
bias, what happens

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:03.670
to these charge distributions?

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:05.170
Well, if you reverse
bias it, you're

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.400
essentially increasing
the amount of charge

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.240
on either side of the junction.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.906
If you forward bias,
you're reducing it.

01:17:09.906 --> 01:17:11.570
So under forward
bias, probably you

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:13.320
wouldn't see the effect
you're describing.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.490
Under reverse bias, the width
of the space charge region,

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:21.960
let's say, increases from, let's
call it 1 micron to 3 microns.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.940
And the thickness of the
entire device is 200 microns.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.740
So still, I think it would
be a relatively small effect

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.507
several 10's of microns
away from the junction.

01:17:30.507 --> 01:17:32.090
It really depends
on the length scale,

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:35.850
the geometry of your device
relative to the length scale

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:39.490
of your space charge region.

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:40.162
Good?

01:17:40.162 --> 01:17:42.620
Well, to give you time to reach
your next class, thank you.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.203
We'll come back on Tuesday, and
we'll have a great demo set up

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.180
for you.

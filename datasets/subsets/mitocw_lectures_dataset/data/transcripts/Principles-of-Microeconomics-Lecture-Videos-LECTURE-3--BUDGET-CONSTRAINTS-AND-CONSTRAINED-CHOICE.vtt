JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today, we're going

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.480
to continue our discussion
of consumer choice.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.490
And we're going to
talk now about what

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.310
happens when we take that
unconstrained choice we talked

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.270
about on Monday and
impose budget constraints.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.480
We'll talk about what
budget constraints are.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.470
We'll then come to talking
about how consumers

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.210
make constrained choices.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.670
And then we'll end with
an example of food stamps.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.410
So let's start by talking
about budget constraints.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.990
And we'll start by talking
about their construction,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.970
the construction of
budget constraints.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.020
So, basically, last
time, we talked

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.270
about the fundamental
axiom of consumer choice

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.690
that more is better.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.410
So what stops people from
just bingeing on everything?

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.910
It's their budget constraint.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.860
It's their limited resources.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.410
Now, for most of
this course, we're

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.580
going to make a simplifying
assumption that your budget--

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.680
that is what you spend--

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.020
equals your income.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.360
That is what you earn, OK?

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.080
That is there won't be any
savings or borrowing, OK?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.110
Now that is a
simplifying assumption.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.860
And, indeed, we'll
spend a couple lectures

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.110
at the end of the semester
talking about what happens

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.780
when people can save or borrow.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.150
That said, this is not
a terrible description

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.500
of most Americans.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.220
The median American household
has $400 in the bank.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.770
So this is not kind of
a terrible description

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.530
of the way most people live
their lives in America,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.270
which is what they
earn each week is

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.890
what they spend each week.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.605
So that's what we'll do.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.730
It also might not be sort
of a terrible description

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.195
of your life.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.570
I presume, in college, you're
not doing a lot of savings.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.640
You maybe do a little
borrowing, but not

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.493
a lot of savings or borrowing.

00:01:56.493 --> 00:01:57.910
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.440
going to assume that's
true for you as well.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.570
We're going to assume your
parents have given you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.160
some amount of money to spend.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.760
We'll call it Y. Your income
Y is the amount of money

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.740
your parents have given
you to spend for say

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.800
the semester or the month.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.530
And, once again, let's say
all you spend your money on

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.070
is pizza and cookies, OK?

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.100
That's all you want to
spend your money on.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.140
We write the budget
constraint as saying

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.830
that your resources,
your income Y,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.980
can be spent on either
pizza or cookies.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.080
And the constraint is
that you could spend it--

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.510
that budget has to be divided
between pizza, where there's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.720
the price per slice of pizza
times the number of slice

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.670
of pizza, or cookies.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.370
We have the price per cookie
times the number of cookies.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420
So p sub p is the price
per slice of pizza.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.510
p sub c is the price per cookie.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.090
P is the number of pizzas, and
C is the number of cookies.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.340
That's your budget constraint.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.520
You can essentially
devote your income

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.092
to some combination
of pizza and cookies,

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:03.050
but you have to consider
how much they actually

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.540
cost in doing that.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.680
I find this easier
to see graphically.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.270
So let's turn to figure 3-1.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.845
Figure 3-1 shows a
budget constraint.

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:14.470
So how does the budget
constraint look?

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.500
Well, the x-axis is
your income divided

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.970
by the price of cookies.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.380
That is, if you decide to devote
all your income to cookies,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.340
then how many
cookies can you have?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.320
Y over pc.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.960
If your income is $100,
and cookies are $10--

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.850
that means you're going
to Insomnia Cookies--

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.660
then you can only have
10 cookies, et cetera.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.210
Likewise, the
y-intercept is the income

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.460
divided by the price of pizza.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.170
That's how many
pizzas you can have.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
The budget constraint
represents--

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.410
the budget constraint, the
slope of the budget constraint,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.680
is the price ratio, the
negative of the price ratio

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.930
because it's a downward-sloping
line, pc over pp.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.560
That is every extra
cookie that you

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.310
buy, holding your
income constant,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.190
lowers the amount of pizza
you can have by p sub p, OK?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.480
So let's consider an example.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.180
Suppose that Y is $96,
that the price of pizza--

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.970
it's an expensive
pizza place-- is $12,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.730
and the price of a
cookie is $6, OK?

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.480
$12 for pizza, this is like
downtown San Francisco or New

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.400
York.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.680
$96 income, $12 for a slice
of pizza, $6 for a cookie, OK?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.180
I'm sorry.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.990
Y is-- I wanted to
make Y 72, my bad.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.230
So Y is 72.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.650
Your income is $72, OK?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.400
And you can spend it
on pizza and cookies,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.730
and those are the prices.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.830
Now what that means is,
if you wanted just pizza,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.000
you could get six pizzas.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.880
If you wanted just cookies,
you can get 12 cookies.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.850
And, generally,
the rate at which

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.290
you can trade off pizza for
cookies is minus 1/2, OK?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.270
That is every additional
cookie would require giving up

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.937
half a slice of pizza, OK?

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:22.520
Every additional cookie requires
giving half a slice of pizza.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.010
That's why the slope
would be negative 1/2, OK?

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.520
So, basically, we're going to
call the slope of the budget

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.250
constraint--

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.150
the slope, we are going
to call the Marginal Rate

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.720
of Transformation, the MRT.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.720
Last time, we did the MRS, the
Marginal Rate of Substitution.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.690
Now we're going to have
MRT, the marginal rate

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.720
of transformation, which is
equal to minus pc over pp.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.280
Or the slope of the
budget constraint, OK?

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.650
That is the marginal
rate of transformation.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.250
Now this class is not alchemy.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.770
We are not literally
transforming pizza

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.370
into cookies.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.578
That would be kind of cool,
but we're not doing that.

00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:08.370
That's somewhere
else at MIT, OK?

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.770
But it's effectively
doing the same thing.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.330
What we're doing is, given that
we have a fixed amount of money

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.920
and given that we're
going to spend it all,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.920
the more you spend on pizza,
the less you spend on cookies.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.780
So you're effectively
transforming pizza

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.700
into cookies and vice
versa because you're

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.950
going to spend all your money.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.450
You've got to spend
it on something.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.920
So, the more you spend on one,
the less you get of another.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.337
So, through the
budget constraint,

00:06:31.337 --> 00:06:34.870
we are effectively transforming
one good to the other.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.610
By having more of one, we're
getting less of the other.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.110
So that's the sense
in which we call

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.777
it the marginal rate
of transportation--

00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:43.450
of transformation.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.660
So, basically, this comes
back to the key concept

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.940
we talked about in the very
first lecture, opportunity

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.930
cost.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.010
The opportunity cost of a
slice of pizza is two cookies.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.760
Remember, opportunity
cost is the value

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.160
of the next best
alternative, OK?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.960
The opportunity cost is
the next best alternative.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.960
Well, here you only have
two alternatives, pizza

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.290
and cookies.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.480
So the opportunity cost of a
slice of pizza is two cookies.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.980
And that's the sense
in which you're

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.880
transforming pizza into cookies
or cookies into pizza, OK?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.550
Now this seems kind of
abstract, but let's actually

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.220
think of an organization
which has taken this principle

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.550
to heart to develop the
best method of weight loss

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:37.410
in America, which is Weight
Watchers, OK, Weight Watchers.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.460
Now it turns out that
dieting is super hard

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.865
and basically doesn't work, OK?

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:45.240
There's a large
literature, which

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.400
says that people go
on diets all the time.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.800
Then they stop them, and
they gain the weight back.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.460
OK, dieting is incredibly hard
and basically doesn't work, OK?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.080
But a much more
successful approach

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.550
has been established
by Weight Watchers.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.050
It's not the only
approach, but it's

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.720
been proven much
more successful, OK?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.700
And, essentially, what
does Weight Watchers do?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.060
They set up a budget constraint
and ask you to follow it.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.690
So, for example,
they essentially

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.308
assign point values to every
good you might consume.

00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:14.850
You go on the website,
and everything

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.850
in the world you might want
to eat has a point value.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.755
They then ask, well, what
weight are you today?

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:22.880
What's your age and gender?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.080
That stuff matters
for weight loss.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.125
And what weight do
you want achieve?

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.000
And they say, if you
want to achieve a weight

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.850
loss of x over y
days, then you've

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.400
got to limit
yourself to z points.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.169
So, essentially, your
goal is to lose weight.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.240
So we're going to give
you the budget constraint.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.907
We're not going to
tell you what to eat.

00:08:40.907 --> 00:08:42.550
That's why it's
better than dieting

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.300
because, once again,
Adam Smith was right.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.467
People like to have choices.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:47.730
They like to let
choice drive things.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.780
But we are going to
tell you a total budget.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.450
So, for example, vegetables
are like zero points.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.460
Snickers bars are like
six points, et cetera.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.130
They have various
point systems, OK?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.500
So, for example, suppose your
budget is 30 points, which

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.440
would be pretty typical, OK?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.570
Suppose you go to
McDonald's for lunch,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.370
and you get a number one.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.470
The number one at
McDonald's is a Big Mac,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.010
which has 14 points, fries,
which have 10 points,

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.720
and a Coke, which
has six points.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.280
That's 30 points, and
it's only lunch, OK?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.570
You've blown your whole
budget for the day on lunch.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.420
Now you could just get
depressed and say screw it.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.777
I'll just be fat.

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:29.360
But, clearly, looking
around the room,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.050
you guys have not
made that choice.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.800
Or you could look at
the budget constraint

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.690
and say, well, what
else can I get.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.270
Well, it turns out you can
get a 10-piece nugget, which

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.300
is 12 points, apple
slices, which is one point,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.160
and a Diet Coke,
which is zero points,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.260
for a total of only 13 points.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.015
Now you have 13 points and
plenty of room for dinner.

00:09:48.015 --> 00:09:49.640
Now, to be honest,
anyone who tells you

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.760
that second lunch is as good as
that first lunch is a liar, OK?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.250
I'd much rather a Big Mac and
fries and a Coke than nuggets

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.500
and apple slice and Diet Coke.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.440
Give me a break.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.920
But I'd also much
rather have dinner, OK?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.950
So, basically, this lets
you make the trade-off

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.470
by imposing a budget
constraint, by setting

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.810
relative prices across goods.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.330
The points are like utils.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.520
They're not meaningful.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.255
They're only
meaningful relatively.

00:10:14.255 --> 00:10:17.950
It lets you set relative
prices across goods

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.540
and then it lets
you, essentially,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.210
optimize across those various--

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.980
across those various goods.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.170
So budget constraints,
essentially,

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.290
by setting up this marginal
rate of transformation,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.054
can help with a lot of
kind of decisions in life.

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:36.330
OK, questions about that?

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.848
OK, now what happens if we
shock the budget constraint?

00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:40.390
So we talked about
constructing them.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.550
What about shocking
the budget constraint?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.425
We're going to do a lot
in this class of what

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:46.967
we call comparative statics,
which is, essentially,

00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:48.550
making changes in
one thing or another

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.780
and seeing what it
does to the system.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.910
So let's talk about shocking
the budget constraint.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.060
Let's start first with
a change in prices.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:04.250
Suppose the price of pizza
goes from $12 up to $18.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.860
This is a really good
slice of pizza, OK?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.700
Well, what happens to
the budget constraint?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.490
Let's look at figure 3-2.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.800
Figure 3-2 shows what happens.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.010
You have your original
budget constraint BC1.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:24.040
The equation of that line is
12P plus 6C equals 72, OK?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.302
The price of pizza and the
number of slices of pizza

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:28.510
plus the price of cookies
times the number of cookies

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.810
equals 72.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.120
Now the price of
pizza has gone up.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.210
What that's done is that has
pivoted inward your budget

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.870
constraint to BC2.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.110
It has flattened the
budget constraint

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.200
because the slope,
remember, is the ratio

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.310
of the price of cookies to
the price of pizza, right?

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.330
That's a ratio.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.520
Well, that ratio
has just fallen.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.050
It used to be a 1/2.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.360
Now it's a 1/3.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.110
Negative 1/2-- well,
it used to be a half.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.735
Now it's a 1/3.

00:11:56.735 --> 00:12:00.880
So the slope has fallen from
negative 1/2 to negative 1/3.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.940
So what's happened is you can
still have as many cookies

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.350
as you had before.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.690
The y-intercept has
not changed, but you

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.440
can have fewer slices of pizza.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.150
That's why it's a pivot
because one price has not

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.400
changed, only the other price.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.402
So it's a pivot inward.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.860
The other thing
here, you'll notice

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.070
we have all these funny
dots and stuff, OK?

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.930
That represents
what has happened

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:30.280
to what we call your opportunity
set, your opportunity

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.080
set, which is an
important concept, OK?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.900
Your opportunity set is the
set of choices available to you

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.440
given your income
and market prices,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.550
the set of choices available
to you given your income

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.500
and market prices.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.570
So your opportunity
set initially

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.440
was the black dots
plus the red dots.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.140
Now your opportunity
set has shrunk.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.930
Your opportunity set is
now just the black dots.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.900
Given your income,
you can now get

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.710
less stuff, same amount of
cookies, but less pizza.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.060
And you are worse off.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.905
Your opportunity set has shrunk.

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:14.280
Your opportunity set-- even
though your parents are still

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.800
sending you the same check, you
are worse off because you can

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.950
now buy less pizza with it, OK?

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.495
So that's what happens
to the opportunity set

00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:26.370
when a price changes.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.990
And, likewise, you
should show to yourself

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.540
the same thing will happen when
the price of cookies change.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.040
In that case, you'll
get an increase

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.710
in the steepness of the
budget constraint, OK?

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.570
But your opportunity
set will still--

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.810
your opportunity set
will still shrink, OK?

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.560
Now what about-- yeah?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.477
AUDIENCE: Don't we not
care about all the dots

00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:45.750
below the line, though,
because we're assuming

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.130
we're spending all the money?

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.100
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a good point,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.910
and we're going to
come back to that.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.130
We haven't-- we assume they're
spending all their money,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.630
but it's just a way
of representing.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.968
You could think of the line
being lower as the same thing.

00:13:56.968 --> 00:13:58.760
We care about-- we just
care about the area

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.813
because it represents the
set, but you're right.

00:14:00.813 --> 00:14:02.480
You could just focus
on the line and say

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.490
the line is everywhere lower.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.690
So they're worse off.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.380
That's another
way to look at it.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.880
But we like to think
about as a set.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.580
It comes in handy later
for various reasons, OK?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.970
But that's a good question.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.950
Now let's ask about
a second thing.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.660
What if your income goes up?

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.180
What if prices are
back to 12 and 6,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.940
but your parents decide
to send you more money?

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.952
Suppose your parents--
or send you less money.

00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:28.160
It turns out you haven't
been paying enough attention

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.820
in 14.01.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.812
You're parents are mad.

00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:30.770
They're monitoring you.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.540
That's why we have
the camera here.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.242
This goes directly to
all your parents, OK?

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:39.470
I'm sort of joking.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.570
And so let's say parents cut
your allowance to $60, OK?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.570
Well, what does that do?

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.800
That's in figure 3-3.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.340
OK, in figure 3-3, the
old budget constraint

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.180
was that you get
pizzas and cookies

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.180
at a price of $6 and $12,
and you could get them

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.040
until you spend $72.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.830
Now you can only get
them until you spend $60.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.260
Now what we see is not a pivot
in the budget constraint,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.042
but an inward shift in
the budget constraint,

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:07.000
because the relative
price of pizza and cookies

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.230
has not changed.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.075
Therefore, the slope
hasn't changed.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.700
OK, the slope is
dictated solely--

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.590
you don't do anything
to control the slope.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.560
The market controls
the slope, OK?

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.370
But you and your family
control the level,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.180
and the level has shrunk.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.750
So you're pivoting inwards, OK?

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.880
And, once again,
now, instead of being

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.090
able to buy say 12
cookies and six pizzas,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.850
now you can only buy say
10 cookies and five pizzas.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.400
That's the most you can get, OK?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.310
So, once again, your opportunity
set has been restricted,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:43.722
but in a different kind of way
through this pivot inward, OK?

00:15:43.722 --> 00:15:45.180
So that's how we
sort of manipulate

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.222
these budget constraints.

00:15:46.222 --> 00:15:48.475
And we're going to come
back to that next lecture.

00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:49.350
That'll be important.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.935
Yeah?

00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:51.768
AUDIENCE: So, in looking
at the differences,

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:54.210
can like an increase
in the price of pizza

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.940
or like a decrease
in your budget--

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.032
is it more showing that
like the change in slopes

00:15:58.032 --> 00:15:59.490
doesn't really
affect you if you're

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.690
like say buying more
cookies than pizza?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.760
But like, in terms of if
your budget as a whole

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.910
decreases, then it
affects you overall.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.930
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a great question,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.370
and we're going to actually
answer that question

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.780
next lecture very explicitly.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.370
So hold on to that
question, and we'll

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.500
talk about we're going
to compare explicitly

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.035
why income changes
differ from price changes

00:16:16.035 --> 00:16:17.660
and what are the
underlying mechanisms.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.310
Yeah?

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.140
AUDIENCE: How do you
determine your marginal rate

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.760
of transformation?

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.990
How do determine your--
like say it wasn't just

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.780
pizza and cookies.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.500
Like say it was more products.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.785
How would you
determine that value?

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.410
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Great, great question.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.060
So, as I said, we
always are going

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.410
to start with simplifying
assumptions to make life easy.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.260
There's no reason
that this couldn't

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.750
be written in three dimensions.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.050
And you'd have
relative marginal rates

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.425
of transformation, rates at
which you're willing to trade

00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:43.703
off various things.

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:45.870
So you could just extend
the math in all dimensions.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.662
It wouldn't add any
richness, and it'd just

00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:49.200
make your head spin.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.540
But the basic-- so
all the basic ideas

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.350
can come across with
two goods, but it'd

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.288
be the same mechanics
with more goods, OK?

00:16:56.288 --> 00:16:58.830
You essentially, when we get to
the constrained optimization,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.020
you'll essentially have
more first-order conditions

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.440
in your constrained
optimization.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.440
That's the way to
think about it.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.609
OK, so let's-- actually,
that's a great segue.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.349
Let's turn to the
second part, which

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:12.430
is how we use budget
constraints and the utility

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:17.109
function we learned about
last time to actually describe

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.369
how consumers make choices.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.900
So we're going to take utility.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.869
Remember, I said
last time consumers

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.630
are going to maximize their
utility subject to a budget

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.381
constraint.

00:17:26.381 --> 00:17:28.089
Well, now we've taught
you about utility.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.900
We've taught you about
budget constraints.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.990
Let's put them together, OK?

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.340
How to consume-- how do
consumers put them together?

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.360
Well, graphically, the
representation of preferences

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.100
was our indifference curves.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.930
That represented
people's indifference

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.430
with further out
indifference curves

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.660
made people happy, right?

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.623
That was last time.

00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:50.790
So, essentially, what we're
going to ask graphically

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.310
is what is the
highest indifference

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.490
curve you can achieve
given your budget, right?

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.740
We know you want to be that
highest indifference curve

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.840
possible by more is better.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.700
So we're simply
going to ask what

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.410
is the highest
indifference curve you can

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.330
reach given your budget, OK?

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.880
So let's consider the same
utility from last time.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.940
Utility is square
root of P times C, OK?

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.450
And let's consider the same
budget we wrote down up here--

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:26.370
$72 income, $12 price of
pizza, $6 price of cookies.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.347
And now let's ask where
can you go with that.

00:18:30.347 --> 00:18:32.430
So let's turn to figure
3-4 and do it graphically.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.390
We'll do it mathematically
in a minute, OK?

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.480
So, in figure 3-4, you
have our budget constraint,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.060
which runs from 6
pizzas to 12 cookies.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.650
That's the original
budget constraint.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.940
And you have a series
of indifference curves.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.260
And these indifference
curves, I1, I2, I3, I4,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.950
they all come directly
from this utility function.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.972
So, simply, I've solved
this utility function.

00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:56.680
I'll talk about the
math in a little bit,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.850
and you'll do more math
in section on Friday, OK?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.350
But, essentially,
you can solve--

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.350
we'll show you--
you'll drive on Friday

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.225
how you take this
utility function

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:08.810
and literally can draw the
indifference curves from it,

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.390
OK?

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.570
But, for now, take my word
that these indifference curves

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.530
represent this utility function.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:21.173
And what we see is that
point D is the furthest out

00:19:21.173 --> 00:19:23.090
indifference curve you
can achieve while still

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.070
meeting your budget, while still
meeting your budget constraint.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.730
And, therefore, we say that
the optimum, graphically,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:36.200
is the tangency between
your indifference curve

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.210
and your budget constraint is
the optimal constrained bundle.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.210
You see how we brought--

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.627
last time, we talked about
further out indifference curves

00:19:44.627 --> 00:19:45.335
make you happier.

00:19:45.335 --> 00:19:47.127
Today, we talked about
the fact that you're

00:19:47.127 --> 00:19:48.120
limited by your budget.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.870
So we have the furthest
indifference curve

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.020
you can get to is going
to be, definitionally,

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.750
at the tangent of the
indifference curve

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.850
and the budget constraint.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.390
And, once again,
that gives you--

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.560
we realize we don't want
to measure utils, but, just

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.560
for mathematical, for
mathematical purpose, that

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.840
gives utility at the tangency
of square root of 18, OK?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.370
At that point, you are choosing
six cookies and three pizzas.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.650
That is the choice
you are making.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.370
That is the best off you
can get given your budget.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.920
And, to see this, let's
talk about some other points

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.170
and why they're not better, OK?

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.680
Let's talk about point A.
Why isn't point A better?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.970
Why isn't it better
to have two-- maybe

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.880
you just-- maybe you
like cookies a lot

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.380
and don't like--
or like pizza a lot

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.755
and don't like
cookies that much.

00:20:37.755 --> 00:20:40.392
How can we say that point
D is better than point A?

00:20:40.392 --> 00:20:40.892
Yeah?

00:20:40.892 --> 00:20:42.870
AUDIENCE: Because point D is
on a higher indifference curve.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.430
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's on a
higher indifference curve.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.290
So point D dominates
point A because it's

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.560
a higher indifference curve.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.060
Well, fine.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.327
Same person, by that logic,
why not choose point E?

00:20:52.327 --> 00:20:53.660
AUDIENCE: It's above the budget.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
you can't afford it.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.090
So the bottom line is
you can see graphically

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.960
why the tangency is
the best you're going--

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.330
is the best you're going to do.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.770
OK, likewise, point C
you wouldn't choose.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.660
Point C has the same slope.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.280
It has the same
slope as point D.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.520
In other words, the slope
is minus 1/2 at point C.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.530
You've drew a line tangent
to point C. The slope will

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.897
be minus 1/2, just
like it is at point D,

00:21:19.897 --> 00:21:21.730
but you wouldn't be
spending all your money.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.350
So you wouldn't choose
that point either.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.330
Yeah?

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.435
AUDIENCE: What if you have
just three indifference

00:21:27.435 --> 00:21:29.310
curves so there is none
that hit the tangent?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.640
Do you just go for one that's
like the most tangent I guess?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.057
JONATHAN GRUBER: We're going
to come to-- we're going to--

00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:35.530
well, first of all,
we're not going

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.780
to have discrete indifference.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.560
We could have lines, and
the lines could end up--

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.068
you could end up lying along.

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:44.610
You could end up lying along a
budget constraint for example.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.460
Or you could have--

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.680
you could even have
utility functions,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.700
which just touch a
budget constraint

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.090
at one extreme or another.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.730
And we'll talk
about those cases.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.285
Yeah?

00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:53.680
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
utility function

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.010
go through lines and the
budget constraint, right?

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:56.624
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:21:56.624 --> 00:21:58.240
AUDIENCE: Isn't this just
Lagrange [INAUDIBLE]??

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
let's come to the math then.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.820
OK, let's come to the
mathematical derivation.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.737
So that's the graphic.

00:22:02.737 --> 00:22:04.460
So let's come to the math, OK?

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.150
Now, always a bit
of a tightrope act

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.400
when I'm doing math up here on
the board, so bear with me, OK?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.500
But the key thing is the math
of constraint optimization

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.450
is all about the
marginal decision.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.260
Remember, it's hard to say
how many cookies you want.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.340
It's easier to say should
I have the next cookie, OK?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.140
It's about constraint
optimization.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.950
And what we want to ask is we
essentially want to compare

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.640
how do you feel about trading
off pizzas versus cookies

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.690
versus what will the market let
you do in sort of trading off

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.220
pizzas versus cookies.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.440
That is the optimum
is going to occur

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.770
when we set your marginal
rate of substitution,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:55.221
which, remember, we defined
as minus MUc over MUp, equal--

00:22:55.221 --> 00:22:57.630
I'm going to get rid of this--

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:03.390
equal to your marginal
rate of transformation,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.620
which we defined as
minus pc over pp.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:13.280
And this is the fundamental
equation of consumer choice.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.780
If you understand
this equation, you

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.490
can solve virtually
every consumer choice

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.410
problem I'll give you, OK?

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.820
That basically, at the optimum,
the ratio of marginal utilities

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.100
equals the ratio prices.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.060
That is the rate at which
you want to trade off pizza

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.730
for cookies is the rate
at which the market will

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.570
allow you to trade off
pizza for cookies, OK?

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.770
Basically, it's saying
the ratio of the benefits.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.500
Think of this as the benefits
and this as the costs.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.928
Think of the MRS
as the benefits.

00:23:46.928 --> 00:23:47.720
It's what you want.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.820
MRT is the costs.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.170
It's where you're constrained.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.240
You want to set the
ratio of the benefits

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.840
equal to the ratio
of the costs, OK?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.660
Now I find it actually easier
to think of it this way.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:04.300
If you just rearrange terms,
you can write it as MUc over pc

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.656
equals MUp over p sub p.

00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:10.810
I like this way of writing
it because I call this

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.040
the bang for the buck equation.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.140
What this is saying, your
marginal happiness per dollar

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.860
should be equal.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.210
This is sort of the happiness
per dollar spent on cookies.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.740
This is the happiness per
dollar spent on pizza.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.050
And you want those to be equal.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.550
You want the bang
for the-- you want

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.380
to put your next
dollar where it's

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:37.040
going to make you happiest, OK?

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.020
And so, basically, think of
that as your bang for your buck.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.370
So, for example, suppose
you were in a position

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.350
where the MRS was
greater than the MRT.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.393
You're in a position where the
marginal utility of cookies--

00:24:50.393 --> 00:24:51.810
and I'm getting
rid the negatives.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.830
There's negative on both sides.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.580
So I'm just going to get
rid of the negatives, OK?

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.955
The marginal utility of cookies
over the marginal utility

00:24:56.955 --> 00:25:02.280
of pizza was greater
than the price of cookies

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.280
over the price of pizza, OK?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.640
That is the slope of
the indifference curve

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.230
was greater than the slope
of the budget constraint.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.310
This is the slope of
the indifference curve.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.280
OK, this is slope of
the indifference curve.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.290
This is the slope of
the budget constraint.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.045
In absolute value, the slope
of the indifference curve

00:25:20.045 --> 00:25:22.420
is greater in absolute value
than the slope of the budget

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.780
constraint, OK?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.500
That would be true at points
like point A, point A where

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.180
you intersect--

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.780
where you basically intersect
from above the budget

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.510
constraint by the
indifference curve.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.530
So a point like point
A has a steeper slope

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.660
of the indifference curve than
does the budget constraint.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.330
What that says is
intuitively-- and, once again,

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.280
I want you to understand
the intuition--

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.120
the rate at which you
are willing to give up,

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.670
the rate at which you
are willing to give up

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.820
cookies for pizzas--

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.660
I'm sorry.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.485
Let me say it--

00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:00.610
let me say it a better way.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.120
The marginal benefit to
you of another cookie

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.910
relative to another
pizza is higher

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.660
than what the market will charge
you to turn pizza into cookies.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.560
Let me say it again.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.373
The marginal benefit to you of
another cookie, which is this--

00:26:17.373 --> 00:26:19.290
this is how much more
you want the next cookie

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.570
relative to how much more
you want the next pizza--

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.987
is greater than
what the market is

00:26:22.987 --> 00:26:27.300
going to charge you to trade
in your pizza for cookies.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.415
Therefore, you should trade
in your pizza for cookies, OK?

00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:32.790
So let's say this
mathematically.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:38.010
At a point like A,
point A, OK, you

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.330
have your marginal
utility for pizza

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.180
is the derivative of the
utility function with respect

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.690
to the number of
slices of pizza.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.600
It's the marginal utility.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.267
It's derivative of
the utility function.

00:26:49.267 --> 00:26:59.490
So it's dU dp, which is equal
to 0.5 times C over square root

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.330
of P times C, OK?

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.550
And, at point A,
at point A, we had

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.200
two cookies and five pizzas.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.120
At point A, P was five.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.370
C was two.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.600
OK, that's true of point A.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.685
So we can evaluate the
marginal utility dU

00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:22.595
dp, which equals 0.5 times C
over square root of P times C.

00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:24.220
So that's 1 over the
square root of 10.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.895
That's the marginal utility
of the next slice of pizza.

00:27:30.895 --> 00:27:32.270
The next slice of
pizza makes you

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.590
1 over square root of 10 happy.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.215
Once again, that
number is meaningless.

00:27:35.215 --> 00:27:36.690
So we only care
about it in ratios.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.790
So we need the ratio.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.060
So let's do the marginal
utility of cookies.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:48.890
That's dU dC, which
is 0.5 times P

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:54.650
over square root of P
times C, which is 2.5

00:27:54.650 --> 00:28:00.870
over the square root of 10, OK?

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.290
So the marginal utility of pizza
is 1 over square root of 10.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.330
Marginal utility of cookies is
2.5 over the square root of 10.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:14.410
Therefore, your marginal rate
of substitution is minus 2.5.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.110
Remember, marginal rate of
substitution is MUc over MUp.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.430
So your marginal rate of
substitution is minus 2.5.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.292
What does that mean?

00:28:22.292 --> 00:28:23.750
Can anyone tell me
what that means?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.500
Your marginal rate of
substitution is 2.5.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.333
What does that mean?

00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.560
That is a meaningful concept.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.700
Utils are not, but that is.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.630
Yeah, say it loudly
so we can hear.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.825
AUDIENCE: You're
willing to trade--

00:28:33.825 --> 00:28:35.962
you're willing to trade
two pizzas for one cookie.

00:28:35.962 --> 00:28:37.670
JONATHAN GRUBER: You're
willing to trade.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.790
Exactly, you're willing to
give up 2.5 slices of pizza

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.900
for one cookie.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.310
That's what that number means.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.420
And that is a meaningful number.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.020
That's not an ordinal.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.687
That's cardinal.

00:28:46.687 --> 00:28:47.590
We can use that.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.030
You are willing to give
up 2.5 slices of pizza

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.260
to get one cookie.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.870
What is the market
asking you to give up?

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:00.270
How much pizza do you have
to give up to get one cookie?

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.160
Half a slice.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.353
You are happy to give up
2 and 1/2 slices of pizza

00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:06.770
to get a cookie,
but the market is

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.010
saying we'll let you
have a cookie for half

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.160
a slice of pizza.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.440
So what should you do?

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.380
AUDIENCE: Trade.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.713
JONATHAN GRUBER: Eat less pizza.

00:29:12.713 --> 00:29:13.780
Eat more cookies.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.890
That will unambiguously
make you happier.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:21.320
And that's why you should move
from point A towards point D.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.640
OK, that's the intuition, OK?

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.940
You basically want to
trade pizza for cookies

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.210
until these things are equal.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.050
Indeed, I'd like you to go home
and do the same math starting

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.810
at point B. If you do the
same math starting at point B,

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:43.280
you'll find the MRS
is much below 1/2.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.410
That is, at that point,
you are happy to give up

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.290
tons of cookies to get pizza
because, jeez, you've got 10

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.750
cookies and one slice of pizza.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.542
You'd give up tons of
cookies to get pizza.

00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.375
But the market says you
only have to give up

00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:57.590
two cookies to get pizza.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.770
So you'll happily do it, and
you move back towards point D.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.890
And that's sort of in a bundle
sort of the intuition and math

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.160
and graphics of how we do
constrained optimization.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.900
OK, that is hard
and very important.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.440
Questions about that?

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.240
Don't hesitate to ask.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.150
OK, that is hard
and very important.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.880
If you understand
this, you're sort of

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.680
done with consumer theory, OK?

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.530
This is sort of the core of what
consumer theory is all about.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.110
It's all about
this balancing act.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.220
The whole course
is fundamentally

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.010
all about one equation,
which is marginal benefits

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.810
equals marginal costs, OK?

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.750
Everything we do is going
to be about weighing

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.280
the marginal benefit
of an activity

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.360
against its marginal costs.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.740
If we take the next
step, what's the benefit?

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.818
And what's the cost?

00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:47.610
Well, here the marginal
benefit is the MRS.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.260
The marginal cost is the MRT.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.100
We want to set them equal.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.940
And this sort of example
I hope explained why, OK?

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.760
So that is how we think
about constrained choice.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.540
Now I want apply it.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.240
I want to apply it by looking at
the example of food stamps, OK?

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.052
Now food stamps are not actually
called food stamps anymore.

00:31:08.052 --> 00:31:10.010
When I was a kid, they
were called food stamps.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.560
It's basically a program
the government has

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.900
that provides money
for individuals

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.640
to buy food if
they're low income.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.330
Essentially, we have in the US
what's called the poverty line.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.950
And I'll talk a lot more about
this at the end of the class,

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.408
but the poverty
line is essentially

00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:29.910
a measure of what's a
minimum level of resources

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.560
you need to live in America.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.350
The poverty line for an
individual is about $14,000.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.783
OK, for a family of
four, it's about $28,000.

00:31:37.783 --> 00:31:39.450
How you feel about
that number obviously

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.440
is going depend on
where you're from.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.180
If you're from Boston,
you'll say that's insane.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.470
If you're from some rural
part of the country,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.630
you think, yeah, that's
poor, but manageable.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.042
OK, we'll talk later
about the poverty line,

00:31:48.042 --> 00:31:49.250
what's good and bad about it.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.970
But, in any case, if you're
below the poverty line

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.790
in America, roughly speaking,
you get help with buying food.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.265
And that comes through a
program we now call SNAP.

00:31:56.265 --> 00:31:57.640
It used to be
called food stamps.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.480
I've got to update my notes.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.720
Supplemental Nutrition--
I don't know.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.230
I know the N is for nutrition.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.810
OK, so, basically, what
the SNAP program does

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.400
is it gives you a debit card.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.490
If you qualify on income
grounds, you get a debit card,

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.278
and that debit card can be used
to buy food and food only, OK?

00:32:18.278 --> 00:32:20.570
So you essentially get a
debit card from the government

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.730
that you can use to buy
food if you're poor enough.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.430
And they give you sort of
a fixed amount every month,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.560
and that amount can be
used to purchase food.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.040
So here's the question.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.740
Why go through this rigmarole?

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.678
Why not just give people cash?

00:32:35.678 --> 00:32:37.970
This fancy thing, if we want
to give poor people money,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.620
why don't you just
give them money?

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.453
And we're going to--

00:32:40.453 --> 00:32:42.112
I don't want the answer yet, OK?

00:32:42.112 --> 00:32:43.820
What I want to do is
show you graphically

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.110
how we think about
the trade-off,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.590
and then we'll
come to the answer.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.270
So hold your thoughts.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.940
So let's actually graph how
we think about food stamps.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.070
Let's go to figure 3-5A.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.040
And let's start with
a cash transfer.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.780
So here's the setup.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.490
Imagine people start
with an income of $5,000.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.990
That's super poor, OK?

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:08.080
$5,000 is their whole family
income for the year, OK?

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.338
And let's say all they can
spend it on is food or shelter.

00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:13.380
Remember, as this gentleman
pointed out, in life,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.310
there's more than two goods,
but it makes it a lot easier

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.265
to have two goods.

00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:17.140
So imagine this case.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.880
Your two goods are
food and shelter.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.260
And, actually, quite
frankly, if you're that poor,

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.718
that probably is
the only two goods

00:33:21.718 --> 00:33:24.390
you have to-- you can worry
about at that level of income.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:25.700
OK, it's food and shelter.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.010
So you $5,000 to devote
to food and shelter.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.000
So you have some
original budget line,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.670
which is labeled
there original budget

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.700
line, that runs from 5,000
in food to 5,000 in shelter.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.500
And then you can have some of
in between, some along the way,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.110
OK?

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.360
Now let's say we give
someone $500 in cash.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.780
Obviously, this graph
is not to scale, OK?

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.387
It looks like you're doubling
his income, but it's only $500.

00:33:49.387 --> 00:33:51.720
This just sort of makes it
easier, a not to scale graph.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.330
Let's say we give someone-- we
say to them, look, you're poor.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.950
We're going to give
you $500 in cash.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.130
Well, now all we've done
is shift out your budget

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.007
constraint from 5,000 to 5,500.

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.840
OK, we've shifted out
your budget constraint

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.570
from 5,000 to 5,500.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.460
What does that do
to your choices?

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.380
Well, consider two
different types of people.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.840
Person y, OK, they used to
be on indifference curve I0.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.447
They used to spend almost
all their income on food

00:34:20.447 --> 00:34:21.489
and not a lot on shelter.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.659
They were probably homeless, OK?

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.460
So they spent all
their money on food

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.080
and were basically homeless.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.112
Now what do they do?

00:34:28.112 --> 00:34:30.320
Well, they spend a little
more on food and a lot more

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.342
on shelter.

00:34:31.342 --> 00:34:33.050
Maybe now they get--
you know, $400 still

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.258
doesn't buy you much shelter.

00:34:34.258 --> 00:34:36.469
They spend a little more, OK?

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.620
Maybe, a night a week,
they can get shelter, OK?

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.719
So, basically,
that's what they do.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.197
That's their constrained
optimization.

00:34:44.197 --> 00:34:45.739
We're not saying
it's right or wrong.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.072
This is not normative economics.

00:34:47.072 --> 00:34:48.350
It's positive.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.750
The positive thing is, given
their utility function,

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.010
they move from point y1 to y2.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.600
Now imagine someone
like individual x.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.620
They're different.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.703
Their tastes are such that
they don't need to eat.

00:34:58.703 --> 00:35:00.480
They just want to have shelter.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.660
So they're up at
point x1 initially.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.610
And you give them
that $500, and they

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.680
spend just a little bit more of
it on food and even more of it

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.280
on shelter.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.470
They just love
their shelter, OK?

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.530
And they're just super--

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.780
they're super Weight Watchers.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.430
They don't eat, OK?

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.800
So, basically, they
move from x1 to x2.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.780
Once again, not
normative right or wrong,

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.230
it's just these are
feasible choices people

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.910
could make given the opportunity
set with which they're faced.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.410
And that's what happens when
you give them the $500 in cash.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.960
Questions about what I did
here on this graph alone?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.585
Yeah?

00:35:31.585 --> 00:35:33.340
AUDIENCE: Like, even
if like you gave them

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.330
money specifically for
food, couldn't they then

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.312
just reallocate
their other money?

00:35:37.312 --> 00:35:39.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
that's a good point.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.610
We'll come back to that.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.402
That's time out if
you're not a sports fan.

00:35:41.402 --> 00:35:45.010
OK, so we will
come back to that.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.480
And, in fact--

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.470
OK, but do people
understand what the cash

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.610
transfer is, how it works?

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.030
OK, now let's go to SNAP.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.040
And let's say, with SNAP,
instead of giving them $500,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.640
we'll give them the debit card.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.610
Instead of handing
them a $500 check,

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.470
we give them a debit
card with $500 on it

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.390
that can only be used on food.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.280
How does this affect
their budget constraint?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.720
Now we see where budget
constraints start

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.910
to get interesting and fun
and the kind of challenges

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.118
you're going to face in this
course in drawing budget

00:36:11.118 --> 00:36:11.983
constraints.

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:13.650
The original budget
constraint continues

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.940
to be the original budget line
running from 5,000 to 5,000.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.850
The new budget constraint
is this kinked line

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.230
that runs from 5,000 on
the y-axis to the point

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.680
x2 at 5,000 on the y-axis.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.770
So it starts at 5,000 on
the y-axis, 0 on the x-axis.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.900
There's a flat line that goes
to 5,000 on the y-axis, 500

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.048
on the x-axis.

00:36:37.048 --> 00:36:39.340
And then it slopes down
parallel to the original budget

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.830
constraint to 5,500.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.410
Can someone explain to me
why that's the new budget

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.210
constraint?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:45.710
Yeah?

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.085
AUDIENCE: You can't
spend a negative amount.

00:36:48.085 --> 00:36:50.697
So you can't spend
like negative amounts

00:36:50.697 --> 00:36:52.400
of your non-food-stamp
money on food.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.900
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Exactly, you have--

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.247
we are forcing you to
spend at least $500.

00:36:57.247 --> 00:36:59.830
Compared to cash, where you can
do whatever the hell you want,

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:05.330
we are forcing you to spend
$500 of your money on food.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.848
Coming to the
question back there,

00:37:06.848 --> 00:37:08.890
it doesn't have to be a
specifically labeled 500.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.390
It can be any 500.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.950
But we're forcing you to
spend at least $500 on food.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.330
Well, what does that
do to your choices?

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.550
Well, for person y,
it makes no difference

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.887
whether they get cash or
whether they get food stamps.

00:37:24.887 --> 00:37:26.970
Now the person, light blue
shirt, turquoise shirt,

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:27.803
asked that question.

00:37:27.803 --> 00:37:29.780
Why does it make no difference?

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.340
Yeah?

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.903
Why does it--
whatever, greenish, I

00:37:31.903 --> 00:37:32.820
don't know, yeah, you.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.793
Why does it make no
difference for person y

00:37:34.793 --> 00:37:36.210
if I give him food
stamps or cash?

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.230
AUDIENCE: He's already spending
a lot of his money on food.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.522
So any money he gets he can
just reallocate differently

00:37:40.522 --> 00:37:42.162
so he can spend
some of the money

00:37:42.162 --> 00:37:43.780
he would have used
on food on shelter.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.265
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly, he can
just reallocate his money, OK?

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:48.140
That's exactly right.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.980
So, for person y,
there's no difference.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.378
Look, they're already
spending, what, $4,900 on food.

00:37:54.378 --> 00:37:56.170
You give him a thing
labeled $500 for food.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.670
It's not going to
affect their life.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.870
They'll just take 500.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.270
They'll just spend-- they'll
just treat it as $500 more

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.010
in cash.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:02.980
They're indifferent.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.460
So nothing affects them.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.920
But what about person x?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.470
Well, person x, remember,
the dashed portion

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:14.740
of this budget constraint is
from the old cash example.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.250
And the dotted
indifference curve

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.190
is what they would
have chosen with cash.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.680
Remember, person
x with cash would

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.640
have chosen to still spend
less than $500 on food.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.860
Even when you gave
them $500, they still

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.680
only spent $300 on food.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.270
So we are forcing them to not
be on their preferred budget

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.740
constraint.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:40.420
Rather, we're forcing
them down to point x2,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.420
which is they'll spend the
minimum they can on food,

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.670
but the minimum is $500, OK?

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.470
We are forcing them
down to point x2.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.420
Now why do I say forcing them?

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.600
Why do I know for sure they
are being forced, that they're

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.260
less happy at x2 than they would
have been when they gave them

00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.763
the cash?

00:38:59.763 --> 00:39:00.930
How do I know that for sure?

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:01.930
Yeah?

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.930
AUDIENCE: They're at a
lower indifference curve.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.170
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.295
Think of it this way.

00:39:06.295 --> 00:39:08.170
The fundamental-- one
of the important things

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.850
is people always get
to the point that

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.798
makes them happiest, OK?

00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:13.840
We call it the robustness
of economic equilibria.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.882
People get to the point
that makes them happiest.

00:39:15.882 --> 00:39:19.050
They want-- they
always before had

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.175
the choice of spending $500 on
food, and they chose not to.

00:39:22.175 --> 00:39:24.300
Therefore, if you force
them to spend $500 on food,

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.915
they must be less happy, OK?

00:39:26.915 --> 00:39:27.790
Think of it that way.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.680
They always could have
spent $500 on food.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.460
They didn't.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.877
Therefore, in
forcing them, you're

00:39:31.877 --> 00:39:34.220
making them less happy, OK?

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.150
So they are worse off, OK?

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.500
They are forced to spend.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.090
They'd rather spend
some of that money

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.970
and find a nicer place to live,
but we're not letting them.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:47.300
We're making them buy food, OK?

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.870
Do people-- I don't want--

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.200
I just want to know if people
understand the graphics here

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.870
and the conclusions I drew.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.770
OK, now why?

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.130
Why are we doing this?

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.610
Why would you-- they're
better off with cash.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.860
Why would we force
them to have food?

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.760
Yeah?

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.660
AUDIENCE: Say
because what makes--

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.550
what puts people on the
highest indifference

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.660
is just what makes them
happiest, but not necessarily

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.202
what makes them like
live the longest

00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:14.050
or like have the best
health So, perhaps,

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.800
like if you never spend money
on food, and then you die,

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.998
that would be really bad.

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:20.290
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, but,
basically, what you're saying

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.940
is you know better than the guy.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.190
Let me-- I'm not accusing you.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.320
I'm just saying, look,
if people knew best,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.420
maybe they'd like to just like
have a nice house and die, OK?

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.820
If people knew
best, then there'd

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.080
be no reason to do this.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.210
The reason to do this is because
we think they don't know best.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.110
So, for example, let's change
the label on the y-axis, just

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.750
a small change.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.091
Let's cross out shelter
and write cocaine.

00:40:47.091 --> 00:40:49.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.850
OK?

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.640
Well, in that case, maybe
we don't feel so bad

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.590
about forcing the guy to buy
food instead of cocaine, OK?

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.290
In other words, this a
program which might make

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.380
sense if we are paternalistic.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.010
Now we're getting into normative
economics, paternalistic.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.110
If we think that people
won't necessarily

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.350
make the right decisions
for themselves,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.600
then it may be worth
actually making them

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.100
worse off because
they're not worse off.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.370
Their perceived
benefits are worse,

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:23.070
but they don't know
what they're doing, OK?

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.643
Now you can see why--

00:41:25.643 --> 00:41:27.060
I hope you can
sort of immediately

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.230
see why this concept makes
economists a little nervous

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.213
because why do we know what they
want better than they do, OK?

00:41:34.213 --> 00:41:35.880
So it makes people a
little bit nervous,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.630
economists a little
bit nervous, and a lot

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.320
of people a little bit nervous
to say, gee, maybe they're

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.254
just happier doing cocaine.

00:41:42.254 --> 00:41:44.462
And how do we know that
that's the wrong way for them

00:41:44.462 --> 00:41:45.504
to spend their resources?

00:41:45.504 --> 00:41:46.025
Yeah?

00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:46.873
AUDIENCE: Well,
like can't you look

00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:49.330
at it from the perspective of
like this is taxpayer money,

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:49.830
right?

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.562
So then aren't you
also just factoring

00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:54.320
in how the taxpayer wants to
spend their money and then

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.760
their indifference curve
and all their information?

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.740
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a very good point.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.448
Now but there's sort
of two points there.

00:41:59.448 --> 00:42:04.650
First of all, if the taxpayers'
goal is to help poor people,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.190
then why shouldn't you make them
as happy as possible, right?

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.070
If tax-- why am I giving
money to this poor guy?

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.300
Because I'm sad his poor.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.940
But, what you're saying, I'm
not actually that sad he's poor.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.930
I'm sad he's not eating.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.760
If you're really
just sad he's poor,

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.230
then you should give him money.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.820
If what you're
sad about is, gee,

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.810
I don't like how he's living--

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.300
I don't like his--

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.910
I'm sad he can't have better
food to eat, sad at the place

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:27.410
he lives.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.540
Then you're starting to
impose your preferences,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.498
but let's be important.

00:42:30.498 --> 00:42:32.876
That's imposing
your preferences.

00:42:32.876 --> 00:42:33.548
Yeah?

00:42:33.548 --> 00:42:35.590
AUDIENCE: I feel like the
indifference curve only

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.570
goes for happiness or
like contentedness,

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.680
but, really, the point
of SNAP isn't really

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.690
with contentedness or
happiness, but rather

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.900
like what would be to a
more sustainable life.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.483
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, that's a
related point of the taxpayer.

00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:49.900
If the taxpayer
cares about, look,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.510
we want a healthy
populace that's

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.090
going to live a long time and
be productive and pay taxes,

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.990
then that would be
a reason to do this.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.560
But, once again, I
want to emphasize,

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.385
OK, this is paternalism.

00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:02.510
If you really just care
what makes people happiest,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.430
you should give them cash, OK?

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:10.410
So that raises
two questions, OK?

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.760
First of all, first
question-- yeah?

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.035
AUDIENCE: So how about
like negative [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:17.035 --> 00:43:19.570
Because, for example, if
we pump a lot of money--

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.720
if we allow people to
spend a lot on shelter,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.345
that's not really
going to help people.

00:43:23.345 --> 00:43:25.530
It would just make the real
estate developers rich.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.440
And say the amount
of shelter is kind of

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.962
fixed, but like the amount of
food that eaten [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:30.962 --> 00:43:32.920
So, if we let people
spend more money on food--

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.480
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
yeah, so, basically, that's

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.290
a great question.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.250
And, in general,
we're going to--

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.660
I'm going to answer a
lot of those questions

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.077
with the same cheat
this semester,

00:43:39.077 --> 00:43:41.410
which is we're going to assume
the markets are perfectly

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.190
functioning.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.183
So there's no-- you're imposing
sort of a market failure.

00:43:45.183 --> 00:43:47.350
If there's no market-- once
there's market failures,

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.410
all bets are off.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.710
But, with no market
failure and no paternalism,

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.390
you'd want to give them cash.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.000
So this raises an
important question.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.990
Do food stamps actually
increase food purchases?

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.690
First of all, there's two
reasons why they might not.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.300
Reason one is everybody
could be like y.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.730
x is sort of a
silly case, right?

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.726
You're going to die if
you eat that little.

00:44:07.726 --> 00:44:09.670
And food stamps
aren't that much.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.100
They're maybe like
$3,000 a year.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.210
Everybody is going
spend $3,000 on food.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.318
So the first issue is the first
reason why food stamps may not

00:44:18.318 --> 00:44:19.860
matter is that, in
fact, everybody is

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.720
spending at least that amount.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.640
Everybody is like y,
and nobody is like x.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.700
What's another reason
why it might not matter?

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.030
What's a way people could
get around food stamps?

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.530
Yeah?

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.150
AUDIENCE: Buy food with
food stamps and sell it.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.817
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
they could set up

00:44:31.817 --> 00:44:34.650
a black market where they,
essentially, say, look,

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.272
I only want $2,000 of food.

00:44:36.272 --> 00:44:37.980
The government is
making it worth $3,000.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.355
I'll buy my extra
$1,000 of food,

00:44:39.355 --> 00:44:41.160
and I'll sell it to
people who do want it.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.290
And I'll end up still
eating $2,000 worth of food.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:48.250
So we actually want to know do
food stamps actually increase

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.690
food consumption in practice.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.410
Are they making a difference?

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.850
Well, actually, we've run
an experiment on this, OK?

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.070
We're going to talk
in this class a lot

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.430
about empirical
results in economics.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.000
This class is mostly going
to be a theoretical class.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.550
That is we'll talk
about models and ideas.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.632
But we're also--
since, basically, I'm

00:45:08.632 --> 00:45:10.090
an empirical
economist, we're going

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.990
to talk about empirical
economics, which is results

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.938
and testing the
theories we develop.

00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:17.730
Empirical economics,
here's a great example

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.890
of empirical economics is we
set up a theoretical model.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.720
You always want to
start with the theory,

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.550
but the theory sometimes
has predictions,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.390
which are uncertain.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.640
Here we have an uncertain
prediction from theory about

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.890
whether food stamps will
affect food purchases or not.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.150
So let's test it.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.210
And the way we test
it is we actually

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.175
have run food stamps cash out
experiments where we literally

00:45:37.175 --> 00:45:39.300
take guys on food stamps
and give them cash instead

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.330
and watch what happens to their
consumption before and after.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.350
It's a real randomized trial.

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.050
We literally flip a coin.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.700
Heads, you keep
your food stamps.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.290
Tails, we replace
those food stamps

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.610
with an equal amount of cash.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.010
Then we watch what happens.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:59.450
What happens is that people
spend about 15% less on food

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.430
when you give them cash
instead of food stamps.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.090
That is food stamps is forcing
people to spend about 15%

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.560
more on food than
they would like

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.470
to unconstrained by the cash.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.970
Yeah?

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.505
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this gets
you into the behavior of

00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:12.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.510
I remember reading an
experiment like, if you

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.230
have the price of gas go down,
the actual like amount of money

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.895
spent on gas is constant.

00:46:19.895 --> 00:46:21.520
And this might
translate to food stamps

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.000
because like food stamps
are like explicitly on food.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.375
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, you
know, that's a great question.

00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:29.028
And that's you're asking about
richer theory, richer theory.

00:46:29.028 --> 00:46:30.945
And I'm telling you that
I'm going to give you

00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:31.640
the empirical evidence.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.080
So, whatever the theory
is, the empirical evidence

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.840
tells you what happens.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.810
And there's different
explanations for why.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.590
So the empirical evidence is
that, basically, the price

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:43.200
of our paternalism is 15%, OK?

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.480
We are making people,
effectively, 15% worse off.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.760
We're making them spend 15%
more food than they want to.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.500
So is it worth it?

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.047
Well, actually, the
evidence is starting

00:46:53.047 --> 00:46:55.380
to pour in that it might not
be worth it because there's

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.338
starting to be a lot of
experiments where we're

00:46:57.338 --> 00:46:59.940
giving people just cash,
especially in developing

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:00.922
countries.

00:47:00.922 --> 00:47:02.380
In developing
countries, the answer

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.960
seems to be just
giving people cash

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.260
makes them better
off, that actually,

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.860
especially in
developing countries,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.410
people use the cash
in productive ways.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.643
So, for example, they have a
series of evaluation programs

00:47:14.643 --> 00:47:17.310
where they've given people cash,
mostly in developing countries,

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.728
in Africa in particular,
some in the US.

00:47:20.728 --> 00:47:22.770
And they find that people
spend relatively little

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:26.130
of that on drugs and
alcohol, but they actually

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.707
tend to spend it productively.

00:47:27.707 --> 00:47:29.790
And, in fact, they found,
in developing countries,

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.070
this often provides valuable
resources for individuals

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.250
to start businesses.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.690
So they ran experiment Uganda
where a nonprofit company

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.610
randomly offered
a group of women

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:43.440
$150, which is huge
relative to their income.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.660
That's 50% to 100% of annual
income in Uganda, $150.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:53.010
And what they found was, after
two months-- after 18 months,

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.560
these women had used that
money to start businesses.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.480
And that actually
raised their earnings.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.720
That actually effectively
doubled their earnings.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:05.220
From that one
injection of cash, it

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.790
led them to actually double
their annual earnings, OK?

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.890
So that leads one to
think that maybe we

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.660
should stop being paternalistic
and just give cash.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.320
Unfortunately, if you're a
reader of policy websites like

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.320
I am, the best one
of which is vox.com--

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.535
it's a great website--

00:48:19.535 --> 00:48:21.660
they had an article just
the other day pointing out

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.118
how they actually followed
these women up nine years later.

00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:26.500
And, nine years later, the
effect had totally gone away.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.940
So the story isn't quite
necessarily positive,

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.020
but it's not negative.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.700
They're not worse
off, but it looks

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.200
like, at least what
in the short run

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.990
made them better off, well,
that effect fades over time.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.610
But the bottom line
is, at this point,

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:39.750
I think the evidence
is sort of probably

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.700
in favor of being
less paternalistic

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.090
and just giving
people cash, but that

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.670
runs into a lot of difficulties
in terms of our concerns

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.350
about how people will spend it.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.150
So let me stop there.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.580
We will come back
on Monday, and we'll

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.430
talk about how we actually go
from this stuff to the demand

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:59.000
curves we started
the class with.

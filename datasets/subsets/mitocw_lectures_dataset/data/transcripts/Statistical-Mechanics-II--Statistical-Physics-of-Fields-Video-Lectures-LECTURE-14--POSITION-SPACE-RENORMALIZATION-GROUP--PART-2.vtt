00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:22.150
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.830
Let's start.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.690
So last lecture we started
on the topic of doing

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.304
renormalization
in position space.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.550
And the idea, let's say,
was to look at something

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.110
like the Ising model, whose
partition function is obtained,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.560
if you have insides, by
summing over all the 2 to the n

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:02.470
configuration of a weight
that tends to align variables,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.780
binary variables that
are next to each other.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.130
And this next to each
other is indicated

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.500
by this nearest neighbor
symbol, sigma i, sigma j.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.820
Potentially, we may want
to add the magnetic field

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.590
like term that [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.870
The idea of the
renormalization group

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.960
is to obtain a similar
Hamiltonian that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.010
describes interactions among
spins that are further apart.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.340
We saw that we
could do this easily

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.200
in the case of the
one-dimensional system.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.290
Well, let's say you have a line,
and you have sites on the line.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.280
Each one of them wants to
make their neighbor parallel

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.930
to itself.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.430
And what we saw was
that I could easily

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:12.840
get rid of every other spin
and keep one set of spins.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.410
If I do it that, I get
a partition function

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.720
that operates between
the remaining spins.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.350
Was very easy to sum over the
two variables that spin in

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.550
between these two
could have and conclude

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.340
that after this step, which
corresponds to removing half

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.310
of the degrees of freedom, I
get a new interaction, k prime,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.230
which was 1/2 log hyperbolic
cosine of 2K, if h was zero.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.190
And we saw that
that, which is also

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.170
a prototype of other
systems in one dimension,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.940
basically is incapable of giving
you long-range order or phase

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.570
transition at finite temperature
that corresponds to finite k.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.350
So the only place where you
could have potentially ordering

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.420
over large landscape
is when k becomes

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.910
very large at zero temperature.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.110
We saw how the correlation
length behaves and diverges

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.620
as you approach zero temperature
in this type of model.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.170
Now, the next step
would be to look

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.780
at something that
is two-dimensional.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.070
And in this context,
I describe how

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.460
it would be ideal if, let's say,
we start with a square lattice.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.370
We have interactions
k between neighbors.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.770
And we could potentially
do the same thing.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.980
Let's say remove one
sublattice of spins,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.110
getting interactions among the
other sublattice of spins that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.040
would again
correspond to removing

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.640
half of the spins in the system.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.599
But in terms of
length scale change,

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.700
it corresponds to
square root of 2.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.580
This length compared
to the old length

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.560
is different by a factor
of square root of 2.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.500
But the thing that
I also indicated

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.490
was that this spin is now
coupled to all four of them.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.850
And once I remove the spin, I
can generate new interactions

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.030
operating between these spins.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.630
In fact, you will generate
also a four-spin interaction,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.380
so your space of
parameters is not

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.660
closed under this procedure.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.810
The same applies to all
higher dimensional systems,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.680
and so they are not really
solvable by this approach

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.470
unless you start making
some approximations.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.010
So the particular approximation
that I introduced here

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.750
was done and applied shortly
after Cavenaugh brought forth

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.210
this idea of removing degrees
of freedom and renormalization

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.830
by-- I'll write this
once, and hopefully I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.350
will not make a mistake.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:37.440
Niemeijer and van
Leeuwen And it's

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.750
a kind of cumulant expansion,
as I will describe shortly.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.756
It's an approximation.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.185
And rather than doing
the square lattice,

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.960
it is applied to the
triangular lattice.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.550
And that's going
to be the hardest

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.812
part of this class for me,
to draw a triangular lattice.

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.170
Not doing a good job.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.530
So basically, we put our
spins, sigma i plus minus 1,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.020
on the sides of this.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.080
And we put an interaction k
that operates between neighbors.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.330
And we want to do a
renormalization in which we

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.920
reduce the number of
degrees of freedom.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.220
What Niemeijer and van Leeuwen
suggested was the following.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:15.020
You can group the
sublattices of the triangular

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.640
lattice into three.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.590
I have indicated
them by 1, 2, 3.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:32.250
Basically, there is going
to be some selection

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.340
of sublattice sites
on this lattice.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.490
What they suggested was to
basically define cells--

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.750
so this would be one cell.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.635
This would be another cell.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.185
This would be another cell.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.710
This would be another
cell over here-- such

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:05.260
that every side of the
original lattice belongs to one

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:18.840
and only one site
of these cells.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.340
OK.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.030
So basically, I guess the
next one would come over here.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.250
All right.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:36.559
So let's call the
site by label i.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:45.270
And let's give the cells label
that I will indicate by Greek.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.480
So sites, I will
indicate i, j, cells,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.980
by Greek letters,
alphabet, et cetera.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.910
So that, for example,
we can regard

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:02.410
this as cell alpha,
this one, this triangle,

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.690
as forming cell beta.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.750
Now, the idea of
Niemeijer and van Leeuwen

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.520
was that to each
cell, we are going

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.850
to assign a new spin that is
reflective of the configuration

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.860
of the site spins.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.690
So for this, they propose
the majority rule.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.250
Basically, they said that
we call the spin for site

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:51.920
alpha to be the majority
of the site spins.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.580
So basically, if all three
spins are plus or all three

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.160
of them are minus, you
basically go to plus or minus.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.030
If two of them are plus
and one of them is minus,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.910
you would choose the
one that is a majority.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.440
So you can see that this also
has only two possibilities,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.210
plus 1 and minus 1, which
would not have taken place

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.645
if I had tried to do a
majority of two sites.

00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:32.350
It would have worked
if I had chosen

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.210
a majority of three sites
on a one-dimensional lattice

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.890
clearly.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.540
So that's the rule.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.110
So you can see that for every
configuration that I have

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.670
originally, I can do
these kinds of averaging

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.790
and define a configuration
that exists for the cells.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.170
And the idea is that if I weigh
the initial configurations

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.320
according to the weight
where the nearest neighbor

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.030
coupling is k, what is
the weight that governs

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:09.350
these new configurations for
the averaged or majority cell

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.850
spins?

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.240
Now, to do this
problem exactly is

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.900
subject to the same difficulty
that I mentioned before.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.810
That is, if I somehow
do an averaging

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.390
over the spins in here
to get the majority,

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.780
then I will generate
interactions

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.820
that run over further
neighboring, as we

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.060
will see shortly.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.850
So to remove that,
they introduced a kind

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.410
of uncontrolled break-up
of the Hamiltonian

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.670
that governed the system.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.220
That is, they wrote
beta H minus beta

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:58.020
H, which is the sum over
all neighboring site spins,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.940
as the sum of a part that
then cancels perturbatively

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.240
and a part of that will treat
as a correction to the part

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.100
that we can solve exactly.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:28.300
The beta H zero is this
sum over all cells alpha.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.460
What you do is
basically you just

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.590
include the interactions
among the cell spins.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:42.620
So I have K sigma alpha 1
sigma alpha 2 sigma alpha

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:49.020
2 sigma alpha 3 sigma
alpha 3 sigma alpha 1.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.700
So basically, these are the
interactions within a cell.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.960
What have I left out?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.245
I have left out the interactions
that operate between cells,

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:02.260
so all of these things,
which, of course, are

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:08.680
the same strength but, for
lack of better things to do,

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.720
they said OK.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.060
We are going to sum over
all, you can see now,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.020
neighboring cells.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.215
So the things that
I left out, let's

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:22.720
say, interactions between
this cell alpha and beta,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.180
evolve-- let's say
the spin number

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:35.920
1 in this labeling of beta
times spin number 2 of alpha

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.180
and spin number 3 of alpha.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.550
Now, of course, what
I call 1, 2, or 3

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.190
will depend on the relative
orientation of the neighboring

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.690
cells.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.640
But the idea is the
same, that basically,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.850
for each pair of
neighboring cells,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.870
there will be two of
these interactions.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.030
So again, these no a
priori reason to regard

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.380
this as a perturbation.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.010
Both of them clearly carry the
same strength for the bond,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.840
this parameter K. OK?

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.620
The justification
is only solvability.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.690
So the partition function
that I have to calculate,

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:26.440
which is the sum of
all spin configuration

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:34.270
with the original weight, I can
write as a sum over all spin

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:42.810
configurations of e to the minus
beta H 0, and then minus u,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.710
and the idea of
perturbation is, of course,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.490
to write the part that depends
on u as a perturbation.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.220
It's expanding the exponential.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.650
Now, solvability
relies on the fact

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.750
that the term that
just multiplies 1

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.260
is the sum of
triplets that are only

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.690
interacting between themselves.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.900
They don't see anybody else.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.690
So that's clearly
very easily solvable,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.880
and we can calculate
the partition functions

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.636
0 that describes that.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.840
And then we can
start to evaluate

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.870
all of those other terms,
once I have pulled out

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.590
e to the minus beta H zero sum
over all configurations in Z 0.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.050
The series that I
will generate are

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.750
averages of this
interaction calculated

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.129
with the 0 [INAUDIBLE]
Hamiltonian.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:16:06.140
So my log of Z-- OK.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.090
That's how if I was to calculate
the problem perturbatively.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.990
Now I'm going to do something
that is slightly different.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.930
So what I will do
is, rather than

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.180
do the sum that I
have indicated above,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.755
I will do a slight variation.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:35.990
I will sum only
over configurations.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.060
Maybe I should write
it in this fashion.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.660
I will sum only
over configurations

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:48.940
that under averaging give me
a particular configuration

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.630
of site spins.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:57.670
So, basically, let's say I pick
a configuration in which this

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.030
is-- the cell spin is plus,
the cell spin is minus,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.349
whatever, some
configuration of cell spins.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.950
Now, depending on this
cell spin being plus,

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.160
there are many
configurations-- not many--

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.290
but there are four
configurations of the site

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.250
spins that would correspond
to this being plus.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.480
There are four configurations
that would correspond to this.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:27.260
So basically, I specify
what configuration of cell

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.710
spins I want, and I do this sum.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.930
So the answer there is
some kind of a weight that

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.380
depends on my choice
of [INAUDIBLE] sigma

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.680
alpha [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.000
OK.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.240
So then I have the
same thing over here.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.510
And then, in principle,
all of these quantities

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:02.000
will become a function of the
choice of my configuration.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.980
OK.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:17.180
So this is a weight
for cell configurations

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.030
once I average out over all
site configurations that

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.350
are compatible with that.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:30.520
So if I take the
log of this, I can

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:39.190
think of that as an
effective Hamiltonian that

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.880
operates on these variables.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.930
And this is what we
have usually been

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.715
indicating by the
prime interactions.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.605
And so, if I take the
log of that expression,

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:03.730
I will get log of z 0 that
is compatible with the choice

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:09.770
of cell spins.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.480
And then the log
of this series--

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.700
we've seen this many times--
it starts with minus U 0

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.800
as a function of the
specified interactions.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.870
And then I have
the variance, again

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.893
compatible with
the interactions.

00:19:35.794 --> 00:19:36.294
OK?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.880
So now it comes to basically
solving this problem.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.670
And I pick some particular cell.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:00.660
And I look at what
configurations

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.620
I could have that
are compactible

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.310
for a particular sign
of the cell spin.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.344
As far as the site
spins are concerned.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.875
And I will also
indicate what the weight

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:29.130
is that I have to put for that
cell coming from minus beta H0.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.870
one thing that I
can certainly do

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.070
is to have the cell spin plus.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.360
And I indicated that
that I can get either

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.390
by having all three
spins to be plus or just

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.370
the majority, which means
that one of the three

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.525
can become minus.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.640
So there are these
configurations

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.095
that are consistent, all
of them, with the sigma

00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:05.050
alpha prime, the
majority that is plus.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.180
And there are four
configurations

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.837
that correspond to minuses we
shall obtain by essentially

00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:13.670
flipping everything.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.510
And the weights are
easy to figure out.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.660
Basically I have
a triplet of spins

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.570
that are coupled by
interaction K. In this case,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.180
all three are positive.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.920
So I have three
into the K factor,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.680
so I will get e to the 3K.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.180
Whereas if one of them becomes
minus and two remain plus,

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.470
you can see that
there are two unhappy

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.100
misaligned configurations.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.800
So I will get minus K, minus
K, plus K. I will get e

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.315
to the minus K. It doesn't
matter which one of these three

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:57.815
it is.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:10.080
If all three are minuses, then
again, the sites are aligned.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.560
So I will get e to the 3K.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.060
If two minuses and 1
plus, 2 bonds are unhappy.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.275
One is happy.

00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:20.060
I will get e to the minus
K, e to the minus K,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.790
e to the minus K.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:31.930
So once I have specified
what my cell spin is,

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.900
the contribution to
the partition function

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.870
is obtained by summing over
contributions things that

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.430
are compatible with that.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.480
So what is it if I specify
that my cell spin is plus?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.390
The contribution to
the partition function

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.640
is e to the 3K plus e
to the 3 to the minus K.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.430
It's actually exactly
the same thing

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.500
if I had specified
that it is minus.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.930
So we see that this
factor, irrespective

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.370
of whether the choice here
is that the cell spin is

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:16.070
plus or minus, is log of e to
the 3K plus 3e to the minus

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:22.670
K. Pair any one of the cells
and how many cells I have,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.130
1/3 of the number of sites
with the number of sites

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.630
I had indicated by N,
this would be N over 3.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.130
OK.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.180
Now, let's see what
this U average is.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:53.480
So U-- I made one sign error.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.610
I put both of them
as minuses, which

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:02.830
means that in the
notation I had-- no.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.630
That's fine.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.530
Minus U0.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:18.820
So I put the minus sign here
-- is plus K sum over all pairs

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.080
that are neighboring
each other, for example,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.530
like the pair alpha
beta I have indicated,

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.960
but any other pair
of neighboring cells.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.450
I have to write an
expression such as this.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.570
So I have the K. I have sigma.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:47.480
I have beta 1 sigma alpha 2
plus sigma beta 1 sigma alpha 3.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.050
So this is the expression
that I have for you.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.960
I have to take the average
of this quantity, basically

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.695
the average of the sum.

00:24:59.695 --> 00:25:01.375
I will have two
of these averages.

00:25:04.462 --> 00:25:08.170
Now in my zero to
order weight, there

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.150
is no coupling between this
cell and any other cell.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.540
So what the spin on
each cell is on average

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.560
cares nothing about
what the spin is

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.850
on any other cell, which
means that these averages are

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.230
independent of each other.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.044
I can write it in this fashion.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.180
So all I need to
do is to calculate

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.050
the average of one
of these columns,

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.600
given that I have
specified what the cell is.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.585
So let's pick, let's say sigma
alpha 1 average in this zero

00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:54.540
to order weight.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.150
Now I can see
immediately that I will

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.980
have two possibilities, the
top four or the bottom four.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:07.480
The top four corresponds
to sigma cell being plus.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.705
The bottom four correspond to
the sigma cell being minus.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.740
So the top four is
essentially I have

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.950
to look at the average
on this column.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.910
I have-- it is either
plus, and then I

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.475
get a weight e to the 3K.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.050
Or it is minus.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.570
I get weight e to the minus
K plus e to the minus k plus

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.960
e to the minus k.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.470
So once I add 2 plus
e to the minus K

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.710
and subtract 1e to the
minus K, I really get this.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.100
Now, of course, I have to
normalize by the weights

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.630
that I have per cell.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.040
And the weights are
really these factors

00:26:51.040 --> 00:27:01.350
but divided by e to the
3K plus 3 to the minus K.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.810
Whereas if I had specified
that the cell spin is minus,

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.510
and I wanted to calculate
the average here,

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.380
I would be dealing
with these numbers.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:18.710
You can see that I will
have a minus e to the 3K.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.880
I will have one plus and two
minuses e to the minus K,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.580
so I will get minus
e to the minus K e

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.200
to the 3K plus 3e to the minus
K, which is the normalizing

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.120
weight.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.490
So it's just minus
the other one.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.390
And I can put these two
together and write it as e

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:44.100
to the 3K plus e
to the minus K e

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:51.160
to the 3K plus 3e to the
minus K sigma alpha prime.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.510
So the average of any one
of these three site spins

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:01.580
is simply proportional to what
you said was the cell spin.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.754
The constant of proportionality
depends on K according to this.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.850
So now if I substitute this
over here, what do I find?

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.420
I will find that
minus U at the lowest

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:22.330
level, each one of these factors
will give me the same thing.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.830
So this K becomes 2K.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:33.250
I have a sum over alpha and
betas that are neighboring.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.850
Each one of these
sigmas I will replace

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.570
by the corresponding
average here.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.520
Add the cost of multiplying
by one of these factors.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.450
And there are two such factors.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.990
So I basically get this.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.640
So add this order in the
series that I have written,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.650
if I forget about all of those
things, what has happened?

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.570
I see that the weight that
governs the cell spins

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.870
is again something that only
couples the nearest neighbor

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:21.750
cells with a new interaction
that I can call K prime.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.186
And this new
interaction, K prime,

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:32.950
is simply 2K into the
3K plus e to the minus K

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.325
e to the 3K plus 3 e
to the minus K squared.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.250
So presumably, again, if I think
of the axes' possible values

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:58.050
of K running all the way
from no coupling at 0

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.190
to very strongly
coupling at infinity,

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:06.170
this tells me under rescaling
where the parameters go.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.360
If I start here, where
do I go back and forth?

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.220
So let's follow the path that
we followed in one dimension.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.380
We expect something
to correspond

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.680
to essentially no
coupling at all.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.615
So we look at the limit
where K goes to 0.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.900
Then you can see that
what is happening here

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:37.750
is that K prime is 2K.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:43.170
And then from here, when K
goes to 0, all of these factors

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.060
become 1.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.980
So numerator is 2,
denominator is 4.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.840
The whole thing is squared.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.170
So basically in that limit,
the interaction gets halved.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:04.240
So if I have a very
[INAUDIBLE] coupling of 1/8,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.320
then it becomes 1/16 and
then it becomes 1 over 32.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.560
I get pulled towards this.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.710
So presumably
anything that is here

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.830
will at long distance
look disordered, just

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.450
like one dimension.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.810
But now let's look
at the other limit.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:29.570
What happens when K is very
large, K goes to infinity?

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:36.540
Then K prime is-- well,
there's the 2K out front,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.530
but that's it.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.910
Because e to the 3K is going to
dominate over e to the minus K

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.790
when K is large, and
this ratio goes to 1.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.600
So we see that if I
start with a K of 1,000,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.110
then I go to 2,000 to
4,000, and basically I

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.440
get pulled towards a
behavior of infinity.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.270
So this is different
from one dimension.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.640
In one dimension, you
were always going to 0.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.620
Now we can see that in
this two-dimensional model,

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.510
recoupling disappears,
goes to no coupling.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.600
Strong enough coupling goes to
everybody's following in line

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.700
and doing the same
thing at large scale.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.460
So we can very well
guess that there

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.560
should be some point
in between that

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.950
separates these
two types of flows.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:33.490
And that is going to
be the point where

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.370
I would have KC,
or let's call it--

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.550
I guess I call it K
star in the notes.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.270
So let's call it K star.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:50.810
So K star is 2K star e to the 3K
star plus e to the minus K star

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:56.990
e to the 3K star plus e to the
minus-- 3e to the minus K star

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.850
squared.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.010
So we can drop out the K star.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.360
You can see that what
you have to solve

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:09.320
is e to the 3K star plus
e to the minus K star

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:16.210
divided by e to the 3K star
plus 3e to the minus K star.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.910
This ratio is 1 over
square root of 2.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.040
I can multiply everything
by e to the plus K star

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.140
so that this becomes 1.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.080
And I have an algebraic equation
to solve for e to the 4K star.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.120
So I will get root
2e to the 4K star

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:47.220
plus root 2 is e to
the 4K star plus 1.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:57.080
And I get the value of K star,
which is 1/4 log of-- whoops,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:09.306
this was a 3-- 3 minus root
2 divided by root 2 minus 1.

00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:15.060
You put it in the
calculator, and it

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:24.790
becomes something that
is of the order of 0.233.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:25.290
No, 27.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.679
So yes?

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.050
AUDIENCE: So, first
thing, do we want

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.889
to name what is the length
factor by which we change

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.064
the characteristic length?

00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:45.980
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.860
Yes.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.130
So the next-- yeah.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.250
AUDIENCE: But we never kind
of bothered to do it so far.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.429
PROFESSOR: We will
need to do immediately.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.130
So just hold on a second.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.170
The next thing, I
need this B factor.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.230
But it's obvious, I have
reduced the number of degrees

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.370
of freedom by 3,
so the length scale

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.890
must have in two dimensions
increased by square root of 3.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:14.250
And you can do also the
algebra analogous to this

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.630
to convince you that
the distance, let's say,

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.960
from the center of this triangle
to the center of that triangle

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.250
is exactly [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.122
AUDIENCE: Also,
when you're writing

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:26.416
the cumulant expansion--

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.040
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.890
AUDIENCE: In all of
our previous occasions

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.090
when we did perturbations,
the convergence of the series

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.410
was kind of reassured because
every perturbation was

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.745
proportional to
some scalar number

00:35:40.745 --> 00:35:43.330
that we claimed to be
small, and thus series

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.590
would hopefully converge.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:44.850
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.475
AUDIENCE: But In this
case, how can you

00:35:46.475 --> 00:35:50.200
be sure that for
modified interaction

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.016
and renormalized version,
you don't need [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:56.300
PROFESSOR: Well, let me
first slightly correct

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.540
what you said before I
think you meant correctly,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.750
which is that previously
we had parameters

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.870
that we were
ensuring were small.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.070
That did not guarantee
the convergence

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.050
of the series or the lattice.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.200
In this case, we don't
have even a parameter

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.370
that we can make small.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.240
So the only thing
that we can do,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.970
and I will briefly
mention that, is

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.310
to basically see what
happens if we include

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.530
more and more terms in that
series and we compare results

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.690
and whether there is
some convergence or not.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.190
Yes?

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.648
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain again how

00:36:34.648 --> 00:36:36.800
we got the K prime equation?

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.920
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:44.790
So I said that I have
some configuration

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.990
of the cell spins.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:52.080
Let's say the configuration
is plus plus minus plus.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.085
Whatever, some configuration.

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:57.300
Now there are many
configurations of site spins

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.360
that correspond to that.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.610
So the weight of
this configuration

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.430
is obtained by summing over the
weights of all configurations

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.950
of site spins that are
compatible with that.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.580
And that was a series
that we had over here.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.690
And K prime, or the
interaction, typically we

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.940
put in the exponent, so I
have to take a log of this

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.100
to see what the
interactions are.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.720
The log has this
series that starts

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.179
with the average of
this interaction.

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:29.540
OK?

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:35.810
So this was the formula
for U. It's over here.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:40.100
And then here, it says I have
to take an average of it.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.910
Average, given that I have
specified what the cell spins

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.430
are.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.670
And I see that that
average is really

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.580
product of averages
of site spins.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.890
And I was able to evaluate
the average of a site spin,

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.270
and I found that up to some
proportionality constant,

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.360
it was the cell spin.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.460
So if the cell spin is
specified to be plus,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.610
the average of each one of the
site spins tends to be plus.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.160
If the cell spin is
specified to be minus,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.800
since I'm looking at this
subset of configuration,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.840
the average is
likely to be minus.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.600
And that proportionality
factor is here.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.250
I put that proportionality
factor here,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:26.580
and I see that this average is
a product of neighboring cell

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.100
spins, which are weighted
by this factor, which

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.070
is like the original weights
that you write, except

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:38.732
with a new K. Yes?

00:38:38.732 --> 00:38:42.071
AUDIENCE: So after
renormalization,

00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:47.142
we get some new kind of
lattice, which is not random.

00:38:47.142 --> 00:38:48.534
It's completely new.

00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:51.734
Because what you did here is
you take out certain cells--

00:38:51.734 --> 00:38:52.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.650
AUDIENCE: And call
them [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.358
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:38:54.358 --> 00:38:56.805
But what is this new lattice?

00:38:56.805 --> 00:38:59.330
This new lattice is
a triangular lattice

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:03.640
that this is rotated with
respect to the original one.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.790
So it's exactly the
same lattice as before.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.900
It's not a random lattice.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.530
But on the initial
lattice, you specified

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.640
that these cells
would contribute to--

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.520
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.340
I separated K and K prime.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:16.870
Yes.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.529
K and U, yes.

00:39:18.529 --> 00:39:19.070
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.430
So if you want to do a
renormalization group again,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:23.390
we'll need to--

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.847
Do this.

00:39:24.847 --> 00:39:26.040
AUDIENCE: Again [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.831
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:27.650
Yeah.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.560
But we do it once, and we
have the recursion relation.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.210
And then we stop.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.200
Yes?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.300
AUDIENCE: Is this possible
for other odd number lattices?

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.680
Will you still
preserve the parameter?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.570
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.140
It's even possible
for square lattices

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.559
with some modification,
and that's

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:49.225
what you'll have in
one of the problems.

00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:55.640
OK?

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.840
Fine.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.100
But the point is-- OK.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.210
So I stopped here.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:10.760
So K star was 0.27, which is
the coupling that separates

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.420
places where you go
to uncorrelated spins,

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.010
places you go to everything
ordered together.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.200
It turns out that the
triangular lattice is something

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.850
that one can solve exactly.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.400
It's one of the few things.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.570
And you'll have the pleasure
of serving that also

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.260
in a problem set.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.620
And you will show that KC, the
correct value of the coupling,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.630
is something like 0.33.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:41.865
So that gives you an idea of how
good or bad this approximation

00:40:41.865 --> 00:40:43.510
is.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.260
But the point in any
case is that the location

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.050
of the coupling is
not that important.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.304
We have discussed that
it is non-universal.

00:40:51.304 --> 00:40:53.345
The thing that maybe we
should be more interested

00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:59.320
in is what happens if I'm
in the vicinity of this,

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.920
how rapidly do I move away?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.910
And actually I have to show
that we are moving away.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.610
But because of topology,
it's more or less obvious

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.590
that it should be that way.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:13.220
So what I need to do is
evaluate this at K star.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.340
OK.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.100
Now you can see that K
prime is a function of K.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.680
So what you need to do
is to take derivatives.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.560
So thers' some
algebra involved here.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.810
And then, once you have
taken the derivative,

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.920
you have to put the
value of K star.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.840
And here, some
calculator is necessary.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.870
And at the end of the day, the
number that you get, I believe,

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.460
is something like 1.62.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.280
Yes.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.180
And so that says
since being it's

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.240
larger than 1, that you
will be pushed away.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.040
But these things have
been important to us

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.566
as indicators of
these exponents.

00:41:56.566 --> 00:41:59.640
In particular, I'm on the
subspace that has symmetry,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.470
so I should be
calculating yt here.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:07.260
As was pointed out,
important to this step

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.440
is knowing what the value
of B is, which we can either

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.910
look at by the ratio of
the lattice constants

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.630
or by the fact that I have
removed one third of the spins.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.970
It has to be root
3 to the power yt.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:27.005
So my yt is log of 1.62
divided by log of root 3.

00:42:27.005 --> 00:42:29.890
So again you go and
look at your calculator,

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:37.360
and the answer comes
out to be 0.88.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.300
Now the exact value of yt for
all two-dimensionalizing models

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.940
is 1.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.070
So again, this is an
indicator of how good or bad

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.791
you have done at this
ordering perturbation tier.

00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:53.540
OK.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.880
Now, answering the question
that you had before,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.380
suppose I were to go
to order of U squared?

00:43:04.105 --> 00:43:08.260
Now, order of U
squared, I have to take

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.080
this kind of interaction,
which is bilinear.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.080
Let's say pair of spins
here, multiply two of them,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.900
so I will get a pair of spins
here and pair of spins there.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.150
As long as they are
distinct locations when

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.440
I subtract the average squared,
they will subtract out.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.650
So the only place where I
will get something non-trivial

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.190
is if I pick one
here and one here.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.240
And by that kind
of reasoning, you

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.920
can convince yourself that
what happens at next order

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.590
is that in addition to
interactions between neighbors,

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.550
you will degenerate interactions
between things that are two

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:56.390
apart and things that
are, well, three apart,

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.890
so basically next
nearest neighbors

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:01.380
and next next nearest neighbors.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.590
So what you will
have, even if you

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:07.770
start with a form
such as this, you

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:16.649
will generate next nearest
neighbor and next next nearest

00:44:16.649 --> 00:44:17.565
neighbor interactions.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.250
Let's call them K, L, M.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:30.490
So to be consistent, you have
to go back to the original model

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:35.270
and put the three interactions
and construct recursion

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.260
relations from the
three parameters,

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.090
K, L, M, to the new
three parameters.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.170
More or less following
this procedure,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.580
it's several pages of algebra.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.370
So I won't do it.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.500
Niemeijer and van
Leeuwen did it,

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.340
and they calculated
the yt at next order

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.530
by finding the fixed point in
this three-dimensional space.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.510
It has one relevant direction,
and that one relevant direction

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:06.840
gave them an eigenvalue that
was extremely close to 1.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:12.980
So I don't believe anybody
has taken this to next order.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.290
You've got good enough,
might as well stop.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.440
I think it's not going
to improve and get better

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.560
because this is an
uncontrolled approximation.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.895
So it's likely to be
one of those cases,

00:45:25.895 --> 00:45:28.385
that you asymptotically
approach the good result

00:45:28.385 --> 00:45:29.830
and then move away.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.030
Now once I have
yt, I can naturally

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.520
calculate exponents
such as alpha.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.760
First of all U,
which is 1 over yt.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.210
1 over 0.88 is
something like 1.13.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:53.330
And the exact result would be
the inverse of 1 which is 1.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:46:00.746
And I can calculate alpha, which
is 2 minus d, which is 2 mu.

00:46:00.746 --> 00:46:07.150
With that value of U,
I will get minus 0.26.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.630
Again, the correct result
would be corresponding

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.910
to a logarithmic divergence.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.290
So this zeroed order, OK.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:23.560
Those things, let's say, for
the exponents to 10%, 20%.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.430
You would say that, OK,
what about other exponents,

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:30.100
such as beta,
gamma, and so forth.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:36.305
Clearly, to get those exponents,
I also need to have yh.

00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:38.250
OK.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:54.460
So to get yh, I will add, as
an additional perturbation,

00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.120
a term which is h sum
over i sigma i, which

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.730
is, of course, the same thing
as sum over alpha, sigma alpha

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:10.640
of 1 plus sigma alpha
2 plus sigma alpha 3.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.740
And if I regard this
as a perturbation,

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.080
you can see that in the
perturbative scheme,

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.200
this would go under
the transformation

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:31.720
to the average of this
quantity, and that the average

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.890
of this quantity will
give me 3 for each cell.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.370
So I will get 3h.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.900
And for each cell, I
will get the average

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.810
of a site spin, which is
related to the cell spin

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.940
through this factor
that we calculated,

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:53.250
e to the 3K e to the minus k e
to the 3k plus 3e to the minus

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.440
k sigma alpha prime.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.490
So we can see that by
generating h prime,

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.710
which is 3h times
e to the 3K plus

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:13.450
e to the minus K e to the
3K plus 3e to the minus K.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:19.800
And I can evaluate d
to the yh as dh prime

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.090
by dh evaluated at
the fixed point.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:30.000
So I will get essentially
3 times this factor

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.730
evaluated at the fixed point.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:35.070
But we can see that
at the fixed point,

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:38.070
this factor is 1 over root 2.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.160
So the answer is 3 over root 2.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:48.170
And my yh would be the log of 3
over root 2 divided by log of b

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:52.670
that we said is
square root of 3.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:56.440
Put it in the calculator,
you get a number

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.670
that is of the order of 1.4.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:07.310
And exact yh is 1.875.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.990
So again, once you have yh,
you can go and calculate

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.350
through the exponent
scaling relations all

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.968
the other exponents
that you have like beta.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.220
So not bad,
considering that if you

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.250
wanted to go through epsilon
expansion, how much difficulty

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.650
you would have.

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:30.550
And in any case, we
are at two dimensions,

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.190
which is far away from four.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.990
And getting results
at 2 is worse than

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.070
trying to get results
at three dimensions.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:51.620
Now we want to do the procedure
as an approximation that

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.240
is even simpler than this.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.420
And for that-- so that was
the Niemeijer-van Leeuwen

00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.790
procedure.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:03.140
The next one is due to
Kadanoff again and Migdal.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.650
And it's called bond-moving.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.550
And again, we have to
do an approximation.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.326
You can't do things exact.

00:50:23.326 --> 00:50:28.800
So let's demonstrate that
by a square lattice, which

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.987
is much easier to draw than
the triangular lattice.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:50.650
And let's kind of
follow the procedure

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:54.520
that we had for the
one-dimensional case.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:00.230
Let's say we want to do
rescaling by a factor of 2.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:04.360
And I want to keep this
spin, this spin, this spin,

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:12.550
this spin, this spin and get
rid of all of the other spins

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:13.910
that I have.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.930
Not the circular
round, much as I

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:20.740
did for the
one-dimensional case.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.390
And the problem is
that if I'm summing

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.800
over this spin over
here, there are

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.890
paths that connect that
spin to other spins.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.430
So by necessity, once I sum
over all of these spins,

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:41.416
I will generate all
kinds of interactions.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:49.860
So the problem is all of these
paths that connect things.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.410
So maybe-- and this is
called bond-moving--

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:58.160
maybe I can remove all of these
things that are going to cause

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.081
problem for--

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.160
So if I do that, then
the only connection

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.080
between this spin and this
spin comes from that side,

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.480
between this spin and that
spin comes from that side.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.070
And if the original interaction
was K and I sum over this,

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:25.580
I will get K prime, which is
what I have over there, 1/2 log

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:30.230
cos 2K, because the
only thing that I did

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:34.300
was to connect this
site to two neighbors,

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.220
and then effectively,
it's the same thing

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.010
as I was doing
for one dimension.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.960
So clearly this is a
very bad approximation,

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.340
because I have reproduced
the same result

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.410
as one dimension for the
two-dimensional case.

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:50.380
And the reason is that
I weakened the lattice

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.690
so drastically, I removed
most of the bonds.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:53:00.830
So there isn't that much weight
for the lattice to order.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.940
Kadanoff and Migdal
suggested was, OK.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.770
Let's not to remove these bonds.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:12.070
Just move them to some place
that they don't cause any harm.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.510
So I take this bond and
I strengthen this bond.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.290
I take this bond,
strengthen this one.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:19.890
This one goes to this one.

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.320
Essentially what
happens is you can

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.810
see that each one of the bonds
has been strengthened by 2.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.410
So I have this because
of the strength.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.200
So as simple as you can get to
construct a potential recursion

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.070
relation for this
square lattice.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:46.890
So this is a way
that the parameter K

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.520
changes, going
from 0 to infinity.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.260
And we can do the same thing
that we did over there.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:54:02.740
So we can check that for K going
zero, if I look at K prime,

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.660
it is approximately 1/2 log of
hyperbolic cosine of something

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.720
that is close to 0.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.230
So that becomes 1 plus the
square of this quantity, which

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:19.110
is 4K squared over 2.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:26.856
And taking the log of that,
it becomes 4K squared.

00:54:26.856 --> 00:54:30.170
The factor of 4 does
not really matter.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.490
If K is very small,
like 1 over 100,

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.820
K squared would be
10 to the minus 4.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:41.750
So basically, you certainly
have the expected behavior

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:46.340
of becoming disordered if you
have a [INAUDIBLE] interaction.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.790
If you have a strong
enough coupling,

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:50.860
however, are we
different from what

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.110
we did for the
one-dimensional case?

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.560
Well, the answer is
that in this case,

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:04.260
K prime is 1/2 log
hyperbolic cosine of 4K,

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.320
starts as e to the 4K plus e
to the minus 4K divided by 2.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.360
e to the minus 4K I can ignore.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.680
So you can see that in
this case, I will have 2K.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.440
I can even ignore the minus
log 2, which previously

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.950
was so important because
previously we had 1 here

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:27.710
and now it became 2, which means
that if I start to be 10,000,

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:32.010
it will become 20,000,
40,000 and now you're

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.220
going this direction.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.350
So again, by necessity
almost, I must

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:42.590
have a fixed point at
some value in between.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:48.290
So I essentially have
to solve for K star

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:57.510
as K star is 1/2
log cos of 4K star.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.710
You can recast this as some
algebraic equation in terms

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.920
of e to the 4k e to the
K star and manipulate it.

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.920
And after you do
your algebra, you

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.530
will eventually come up
with a value of K star,

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:24.280
which I believe is 0.3.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:29.370
You can ask, well, the square
lattice we will solve in class.

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:33.000
I said the triangular lattice
I will leave for you to solve.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.140
KC for the square lattice
is something like 0.44.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:44.150
So you are off by about 25%.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.890
Of course, again, the quantity
that you're interested in

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:49.550
is b to t yt.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.550
b is 2 in this case.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:54.370
The length scale has
changed by a factor of 2,

00:56:54.370 --> 00:57:00.530
which is dk prime by
dk evaluated as K star,

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.140
again, a combination of doing
the algebra of derivatives,

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:09.270
evaluating at K star, and
then ultimately taking the log

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.660
to convert it to a yt.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:16.460
And you come up with a value
of yt that is around 0.75.

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:20.360
And, as I said, the exact
yt, which doesn't depend on

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.320
whether you are dealing
with a square lattice

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.510
or a triangular
lattice-- it's only

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:28.100
a function of symmetry
and dimensionality-- is 1.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:38.570
So you can see that gradually we
are simplifying the complexity.

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:42.110
Now we could, within
this approximation,

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:45.980
solve everything
within one panel.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.410
Now this kind of
approximation, again,

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.800
is not particularly very good.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.760
But it's a quick and dirty
way of getting results.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.900
And the advantage of it
is that you can do this

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:04.459
not only in two dimensions, but
in higher dimensions as well.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:28.340
So let's say that you
had a cubic lattice

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.520
and you were doing rescaling
by a factor of 2, which

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:38.580
means that originally
you had spins along

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:42.440
the various diagonals
and so forth--

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:50.300
around the various partitions
of a square of size 2 x 2,

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:55.490
and you want to keep
interactions among these

00:58:55.490 --> 00:59:00.120
and get rid of the interactions
among all of the places

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.430
that you are not interested in.

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:08.370
And the way that you do
that is precisely as before.

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:12.071
You move these interactions
and strengthen the things

00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:13.070
that you have over here.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:18.510
Now whereas the number
of bonds that you

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:23.390
had to move for the
square lattice was 2--

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.860
the enhancement factor
was 2-- turns out

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.880
that the enhancement factor in
three dimensions would be 4.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.690
You essentially have to take
one from here, one from there,

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:36.970
one from there.

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.460
So 1 plus 3 becomes 4.

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.500
And you can convince
yourself that if I

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:55.790
had done this in d-dimensional
hypercubic lattice, what

00:59:55.790 --> 01:00:00.860
I would have gotten is again
the one-dimensional recursion

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:11.770
relation, except for this
enhancement factor, which

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:19.490
is 2 to the power of d
minus 1 in d dimensions.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:25.250
Actually, I could even do
that for rescaling rather

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:30.380
by a factor 2, by a factor of b.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.850
And hopefully, you
can convince yourself

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:38.621
that it will become b to
the d minus 1 times 2K.

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:46.620
And essentially that
factor is a cross section

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.910
that you have to remove.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:56.020
So the cross-sectional area that
you encounter grows as the size

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.560
to the power of d minus 1.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.540
And a kind of obvious
consequence of that

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:06.470
is that if I go to the limit
of K going to infinity,

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:13.020
you can see that K prime b would
go like b to the d minus 1K.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.200
Essentially, if you were to
have some kind of a system

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.620
and you make pluses on one
side, minuses on the one side,

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.880
to break it, then,
the number of bonds

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.880
that you would
have to break would

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.430
grow like the
cross-sectional area.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.630
So that's where that comes from.

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:39.380
It turns out that, again,
this approach is exact

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.710
as we've seen for one dimension.

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:48.860
As we go to higher dimensions,
it becomes worse and worse.

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.170
So I showed you how bad
it was in two dimensions.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:55.130
If I calculate the fixed point
and the exponents in three

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:59.920
dimensions compared to our best
numerical result, it is off by,

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.560
I don't know, 40%, 50%,
whereas 25% over there.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.350
So it gradually gets
worse and worse.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:10.985
And so one approach that
people have tried to do,

01:02:10.985 --> 01:02:13.700
which, again, doesn't
seem to be very rigorous

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.085
is to convert this into an
expansion on dimensionality

01:02:18.085 --> 01:02:20.210
of 1.

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.980
So it's roughly
correct that it's

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.630
going to be close to 1--
correct close to one dimension.

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.400
But as opposed to the
previous epsilon expansion,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.690
there doesn't seem to be a
controlled way to do this.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:43.850
I showed you how to do
this for Ising models.

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:53.360
Actually, you can do
this for any spin model.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.530
So let's imagine that we have
some kind of a model that's

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.290
in one dimension.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.515
At each site, we
have some variable

01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:15.130
that as i that I will
not specify what it is,

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.480
how many variables-- how
many values it takes.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.370
But it interacts only with
its neighboring sites.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:29.940
And so presumably, there
is some interaction

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.770
that depends on the two sites.

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:36.480
There may be multiple
couplings implicit in this

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.170
if I try to write this in terms
of the dot product of spins

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.690
or things like this.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:51.070
So if I were to calculate
the partition function in one

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:55.320
dimension-- I already
mentioned this last time--

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.320
I have to do a sum
over what this spin is

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:10.310
of e to the K of si si
plus 1 and a product

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:13.810
over subsequent sites.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:20.910
And if I regard this as a
matrix, which is generally

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:24.430
called a transfer
matrix, you can

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:28.360
see that this
multiplication involving

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.270
the sum over all of the
spins is equivalent to matrix

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.020
multiplication.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.640
And, in particular, if I have
periodic boundary conditions

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.890
in which the last spin
couples to the first spin,

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:49.070
I would have trace of
T to the power of N,

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:56.434
where t is essentially this,
e to the K of si si plus 1.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:09.570
Now, clearly I can
write this as trace of T

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:14.070
squared to the
power of N over 2.

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.960
Right.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.010
And this I can regard as
the partition function

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.990
of a system that has
half as many spins.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.660
So I have performed the
renormalization group

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.310
like what we are doing
in one dimension.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.550
I have T prime is T squared.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.880
And in general, you can see
that I can write this as N

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.540
to the b N over b.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.610
So the result of
renormalization by a factor of b

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:49.860
is simply one dimension to
take the matrix that you have

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.690
and raise it to b power.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:54.396
OK.

01:05:54.396 --> 01:06:06.060
And so I could parameterize my
T by a set of interactions K,

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.570
like we do for the Ising model.

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:14.340
Raise it to the power of b,
and I would generate the matrix

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.860
that I could then
parametrize by K prime,

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.540
and I would have the
relationship between K prime

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:25.160
and K in one dimension.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.560
So this is d equals 1.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:40.875
And the way to generalize
this Migdal Kadanoff, RG,

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:45.510
to a very general
system is simply

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.700
to enhance the couplings.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.570
So basically, what
I would write down

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:56.140
is T prime, which, after
rescaling by a factor of b,

01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:01.000
is a function of a set of
parameters that I will K prime,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.540
is obtained by taking the
matrix that I have for one set

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:11.800
of couplings and raise
it to the power of b.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.950
This is the exact
one-dimensional result.

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:19.125
And if I want to construct this
approximation in d dimensions,

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.520
I will just do this.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:32.620
So for a while, before people
had sufficiently powerful

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.160
computers to maybe
simulate things as easily,

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.290
this was a good way to estimate
locations and exponents

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:46.370
of phase diagrams,
critical exponents,

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:49.850
et cetera for essentially
complicated problems

01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:53.760
that could have a set
of parameters even here.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.350
Nowadays, as I
said, you probably

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:59.734
can do things much more easily
by computer simulations.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.569
So I guess I still have
another 10 minutes.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:21.949
I probably don't want
to start on the topic

01:08:21.949 --> 01:08:24.310
of the next lecture.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:27.439
But maybe what I'll do is
I'll expand a little bit

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:32.370
on something that I mentioned
very rapidly last lecture,

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:40.600
which is that in this
one-dimensional model where

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:54.520
I solve the problem by
transfer matrix, what I have is

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.939
that the partition function
is trace of some matrix raised

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.229
to the N power.

01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:07.410
And if I diagonalize the
matrix, what I will get

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:12.450
is the sum over all eigenvalues
raised to the N power.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:20.880
Now note that we expect
phase transitions to occur,

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.250
not for any finite system,
but only in the limit where

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.899
there are many
degrees of freedom.

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:34.600
And, actually, if
I have such a sum

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.280
as this in the limit of
very large number of degrees

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:46.270
of freedom, this becomes
lambda max to the power of N.

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:50.310
Now in order to get any one of
these series of eigenvalues,

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.109
what should I do?

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:56.370
I should take a matrix,
which is this e to the T--

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.110
e to the strength
of the interactions.

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:04.040
What did I write? e to
the K of S and S prime.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.020
So there is a matrix.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.392
All of its elements
are Boltzmann weights.

01:10:10.392 --> 01:10:11.350
There are all positive.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.370
And find the eigenvalues
of this matrix.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:29.030
Now for the case of the Ising
model without a magnetic field,

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.470
the matrix is 2 x 2.

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:34.290
It's e to the K, corresponding
to the diagonal terms

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:37.620
where the spins are
parallel, e to the minus K

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.140
when the spins are antiparallel.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.350
And clearly you can see that the
eigenvalues corresponding to 1,

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:53.050
1 or 1, minus 1 as eigenvectors,
are hyperbolic cosine of K--

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.940
strike this.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.765
e to the K plus e to the
minus K e to the K minus

01:10:59.765 --> 01:11:06.450
e to the minus K. You
can see that to get this,

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:10.490
all I had to do was to
diagonalize a matrix that

01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:16.000
corresponded to one
bond, if you like.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.650
And just as in here,
there is no reason

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:23.010
to expect that these
eigenvalues, which

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.420
depend on this
set of parameters,

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.550
should non-analytical functions.

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:32.070
There is no reason
for non-analyticity

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.705
as long as you are dealing
with a single bond.

01:11:34.705 --> 01:11:40.190
We expect non-analyticities
at their limit of large N.

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:46.810
So if each one of these
is analytic function of K,

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:50.505
the only way spanning the K
axis that I could encounter

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:55.860
in non-analyticity is if two
of these eigenvalues cross,

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.730
because we have seen a
potential mechanism for phase

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:00.470
transitions.

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.816
We discussed this in A333.

01:12:02.816 --> 01:12:05.310
That if we have sum
of contributions,

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:08.302
that each one of them is
exponentially large in N,

01:12:08.302 --> 01:12:10.820
and two of these
contributions cross,

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:14.020
then your partition function
will jump from one hill

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:14.870
to another hill.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.970
And you will have a
discontinuity, let's say,

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:19.260
in derivatives or whatever.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.690
So the potential
mechanism that I can have

01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:26.040
is that if I have as
a function of changing

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.460
one of my parameters or a
bunch of these parameters,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.760
the ordering of
these eigenvalues--

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.610
let's say lambda 0 is
the largest one, lambda

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.070
1 is the next one,
lambda 2, et cetera.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:41.180
So each one of them
is going its own way.

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:47.500
If the largest one suddenly
gets crossed by something else,

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:52.010
then you willl basically abandon
one eigenvalue for another,

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:55.490
and you will have a mechanism
for a phase transition.

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:59.680
So what I told you was that
there is a theorem that

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.320
for a matrix where all of
the eigenvalues are positive,

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.650
this will never happen.

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:11.450
The largest eigenvalue
will remain non-degenerate.

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:13.720
And there is some
analog of this,

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.830
probably you've seen
in quantum mechanics,

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.090
that if you have a
potential, the ground

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.640
state is non-degenerate.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.200
The ground state is
always a function

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.390
that is positive everywhere.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:28.210
And the next
excitation would have

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:30.860
to have a node go
from plus to minus.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:34.490
And somehow you cannot
have the eigenvalues cross.

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:39.060
So in a similar sense, it turns
out the largest eigenvalue,

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.830
the largest eigenvector
for these matrices,

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:44.590
will have all of the
elements positive,

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.800
and it cannot become degenerate.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.390
And so you are guaranteed
that this will not happen.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.890
Now the second part of
this story that I briefly

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:58.530
mentioned was you can repeat
this for two dimensions,

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:01.860
for three dimensions,
higher dimensional things.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.640
So one thing that
you could do is,

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.310
rather than sorting the
Ising model on a line,

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:13.010
you can solve it on a ladder,
or a ladder that has two rungs.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:17.910
So solving the Ising
model on this structure

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.840
is not very
difficult because you

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.330
can say that there are eight
possible values that this

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:26.910
can take.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:29.095
And so I can construct
a matrix that

01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:33.810
is 8 x 8 that tells me how I
go from the choice of eight

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:38.370
possibilities here to the
eight possibilities there.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:41.820
And I will have an 8 x 8 matrix
that has these properties

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.570
and will satisfy this.

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:50.090
It will be true if
I go to a 4 strip.

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.330
It will be a 16 x 16.

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:53.230
No problem.

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.180
I can keep going.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.520
And it would say, well,
the two-dimensional--

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.160
and also you could do
three-dimensional or higher

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.226
dimensional models-- should
not have a phase transition.

01:15:05.226 --> 01:15:08.180
Well, it turns out
that all of this

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.930
relies on having
a finite matrix.

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:17.220
And what Onsager showed
was that, indeed,

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.180
for any finite strip, you
would have a situation

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.375
such as this-- actually
more accurately

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:28.720
if I were to draw a
situation such as this, where

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.860
two eigenvalues would
approach but will never cross.

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:35.470
And one can show that
the gap between them

01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:40.930
will scale as something
like 1 over this length.

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.680
And so in the limit where you
go to a large enough system,

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.875
you have the
possibility of ascension

01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:54.390
to some singularity when two
eigenvalues touch each other.

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:57.780
So this scenario is very
well known and studied

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:58.830
in two dimensions.

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:00.270
In higher dimensions,
we actually

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:04.550
don't really know what happens.

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:05.050
OK.

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.687
Any questions?

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.978
AUDIENCE: So it appears that
there are or there are not

01:16:08.978 --> 01:16:11.192
phase transitions [INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:13.630
PROFESSOR: Well, we
showed-- we were discussing

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:16.670
phase transitions for
the triangular lattice,

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:18.320
for the square lattice.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.857
I even told you what the
critical coupling is.

01:16:20.857 --> 01:16:23.190
AUDIENCE: But it seems to me
that the conclusion of what

01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:26.230
you're-- of this part
is that there aren't.

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:29.356
PROFESSOR: As long as you
have a finite strip, no.

01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:33.960
But if you have a 2-- an
infinite strip, you do.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.890
So what I've shown you
here is the following.

01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:43.260
If I have an L x N system
in which you keep L finite

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:47.650
and set N going to infinity,
you won't see a singularity.

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:53.130
But if I have an N x N system,
and I said N goes to infinity,

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:56.240
I will encounter a
singularity in the limit

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.616
of N going to infinity.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.370
Again, very roughly,
one can also

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:07.610
should develop a physical
picture of what's going on.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:13.940
So let's imagine that
you have a system that

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:20.040
is a very large number but
finite in one direction.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:26.070
And this other direction can
be two, can be three, whatever.

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:28.960
You have a finite size.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.620
But in this other
direction, you basically

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:37.150
can go as large as you like.

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:42.640
Now presumably this
two-dimensional model

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.750
has a phase transition if
it was infinite x infinite.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:49.150
And on approaching
that phase transition,

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:50.950
there would be a
correlation length

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:54.460
that would diverge
with this exponent nu.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.280
So let's say I am sufficiently
far away from the phase

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.680
transition that the correlation
length is something like this.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.270
So this patch of spins
knows about each other.

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.580
If I go closer to
the transition,

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.395
it will grow bigger and bigger.

01:18:09.395 --> 01:18:12.840
At some point, it will fit
the size of the system,

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.950
and then it cannot
grow any further.

01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:18.520
So beyond that,
what you will see

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.420
is essentially
there is one patch

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.780
here, one patch
here, one patch here.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:27.000
And you are back to a
one-dimensional system.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.630
So what happens is that
your correlation length

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:33.560
starts to grow as if you were
in two dimensions or three

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.650
dimensions.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.480
Once it hits the
size of the system,

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.760
then it has to saturate.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.610
It cannot grow any bigger.

01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:45.930
And then this block becomes
independent of the next block.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:50.080
So essentially, you would say
that you would have effectively

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.260
a one-dimensional system where
the number of blocks that you

01:18:54.260 --> 01:19:06.980
have is of the
order of N over L.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:11.380
So what we are going to do
starting from next lecture

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.560
is to develop again a more
systematic approach, which

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.920
is a series expansion about
either low temperatures

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.870
or more usefully about
high temperature.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:26.160
And then we will take that
high temperature expansion

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.530
and gradually go
in the direction

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.240
to solve these
two-dimensionalizing models

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:31.980
exactly.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:36.000
And so we will
see why I told you

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.300
some of these results
about exact value of KC,

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.630
exact value yT.

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:43.080
Where do they come from?

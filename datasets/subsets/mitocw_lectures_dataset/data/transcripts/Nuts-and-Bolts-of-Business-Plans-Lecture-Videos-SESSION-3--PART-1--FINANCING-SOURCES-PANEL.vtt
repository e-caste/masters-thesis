00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.940
PROFESSOR: So tonight,
the first part of tonight

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.450
is the financing sources panel.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.340
And we have two of our
three members here.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.512
So I'll invite
them to take seats.

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:32.220
Julianne, we're putting
you in the middle

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.685
because you have to keep the
guys on the end, and Axel.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
And what I'm going to
do is, to give them

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.310
some context about where we are
in the course, just do a recap,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.950
so they know.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.080
And then I'll have them
introduce themselves

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.470
and we'll go from there.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.160
It'll be a Q&A after a brief
description of what they do.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400
So where's the class so far?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.930
We started off two nights
ago with an introduction

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.170
to business plans and planning.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.000
We talked about the importance--
the basic tasks were

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.220
to figure out how
to create value

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.460
and how to capture value,
both for the entrepreneur

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.750
and for investors.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.270
There are the three whys.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.840
Why this?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.775
Why is this an important
thing that you're

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.650
doing that you're going
to spend your time on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.745
or you want people to
invest resources in.

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.210
Why now?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.360
Why now is the
right time to do it.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.820
We've all been on the burning
leading edge of the wrong time.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.815
And then why this team?

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:35.356
The investors are going to say,
well, is this the right team?

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:39.777
And you need to be asking, do I
have the right team of people?

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:41.610
And then if you get
those first three right,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.220
you should be asking
yourself the fourth why,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.960
which is why won't this work?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.170
What am I missing here?

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.140
That was the first
part of Tuesday night.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170
And then Steve Purse
came in and talked

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.497
about how to give
a pitch-- taking

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:58.580
all of that planning you're
going to do and put it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.980
in a way to communicate.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.230
He focused pretty much
on pitching to investors,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.110
but he did point out
the same concepts

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.900
apply to pitching to
partnerships and other things.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.220
Last night we had Bob
Jones come in and talked

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.490
about finding your customer.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.185
It's not sales.

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:18.110
It's not marketing.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.030
It's finding your customer.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.460
What do they want?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.380
What will they pay for it?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.790
How do you find them?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.590
And he gave some really
personal examples of situations

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.110
where he succeeded and
where he did not succeed.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.900
And it was very interesting.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.290
I got him to speak after
the break about something

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.810
he's actually working on.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.540
So that's an important part
of what this class has been.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.914
It's not about abstract
thinking about things.

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:47.580
The people that are
talking are actually

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.570
doing the things
they talk about.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.250
And he's right in
the middle of that.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520
And then we had
Rich Kibble come in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.717
and talk about business models.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:57.675
So I've got a customer.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:02:59.240
I think I have a
value, but what's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.770
the model that I'm going
to use to generate revenue.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.616
The second part of
tonight, Charlie Tillett,

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:05.990
who will come in
after the break,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.230
is going to do
financial projections.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.900
How do I take all
of that, figure

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050
out what it means economically?

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.550
And we talked about it
being not a static process

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.627
but a dynamic process-- test,
redo, until you get it right.

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:22.210
So once you've done
all that planning,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.350
you're going to
need some resources.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.560
And one of the
resources is funding.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.480
So that's what
the panel is about

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.330
The people on the
panel represent

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.320
sort of organized
forms of financing.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.670
But entrepreneurs get
financed in a variety of ways.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.170
So a lot of people talk
about just venture capital.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.860
But plenty of great
companies have

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.140
been launched through angel,
friends and family type money.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.590
A traditional way
is using customers.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.860
You work for a customer.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.680
You see what they don't want.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.210
You then try to move
from a services business

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.060
into a product
business, productize it.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.530
There are grants.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.640
National Science Foundation,
small business innovation

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.770
research funding, SBIR.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.320
This money is
available from each

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.663
of 11 or so federal agencies and
can be up to a million dollars.

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:16.079
I'm working with
a company I think

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.300
is at a million dollars
of SBIR funding.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.120
And we have more recent types of
funding, which crowd sourcing,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.080
where the following at
Kickstarter and others

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.870
have been to fund products.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.990
And we're just beginning
under the JOBS Act that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.180
was passed a year or
so ago to have rules

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.580
out that are going to get
finalized around crowd

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.690
sourcing of investment.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.650
So in Kickstarter,
traditionally it's

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.540
I want to find this product.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.110
In the crowd funding
of investment,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.740
it'll be I want to put money
into a company or a business.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.040
And they're probably
some other ways

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.370
people have funded,
like credit cards.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.990
Business plan competitions
have launched companies.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.180
I was involved in
the company who

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.470
got launched because they got
sued for trademark infringement

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.050
and settled and sold the
name to another company

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.137
and got $25,000 for that.

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:12.470
So that's how they got launched.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.290
So lots of different
ways entrepreneurs

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.950
got to be creative.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.830
But for the panel, we'll
start with the basic organize

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.470
and maybe we'll
open it up to Q&A.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.677
So I've asked each
of the panel members

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:25.260
to introduce
themselves-- a little bit

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.860
about their background, what
you should know about them.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.430
They're entrepreneurs in the
sense that they raise money

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.690
from people in
order to turn around

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.120
and invest it in your project.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.669
So just as you're an
entrepreneur to them,

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.460
they're an entrepreneur
to their investors.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.150
And asked them to talk two,
three, four minutes-- whatever

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.860
you feel comfortable--
to set the stage.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.809
So Axel, we'll start with you.

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:48.600
AXEL BICHARA: Sure.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.110
Happy to start.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.230
Good evening, everybody.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.220
I'll go through my background
a little bit first.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.180
I am from Germany originally.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.610
Came to MIT in the late '80s,
studied mechanical engineering,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.440
and sat in one of these
classes and ended up

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.600
co-founding a software company,
mechanical design automation

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.840
software company, out of--
at the time it was 15-375.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.690
And we raised venture money
relatively quickly $1.5 million

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.720
to start with and then
some follow on rounds.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.070
I was VP engineering
in that company.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.200
We sold it after about
four or five years.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.420
I then became a
venture capitalist,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.020
was at Atlas Venture
for 19 years in total.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.470
Raised and invested about
$2 billion to $2.5 billion

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.350
while I was there and
did mostly early stage,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.220
self slash early stage
technology startups.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.900
I left there about two years
ago to do deals on my own.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.410
And so I have helped start
a couple of companies

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.480
and have made a number of
personal investments as well.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.250
And one of the
companies I helped start

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.030
is actually an accelerator
for hardware startups.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.190
Called Bolt in downtown Boston.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.292
So that's another financing
model I got exposed to

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:12.470
and really got involved with
where you don't provide just

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.980
capital and some high level
expertise and strategy,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.180
but real hands-on
work on product,

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.830
much more hands-on company
building, team building,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.930
than you do in a
venture capital.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.550
And we're doing that with very
early stage companies there.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.710
So I can I think in
the evening here talk

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.150
about it angel financing.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.560
I'm an angel.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.950
I'm involved in
this accelerator.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.990
I've been in the VC
business for a long time.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.500
And I'm also involved
in a company called

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.020
Dragon Innovation,
which is a crowdfunding

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.850
company for hardware startups.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.590
So I think that's actually one
of the very interesting ways

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.050
of getting companies off
the ground that may not

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.852
show necessary the highest
potential from the beginning,

00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:02.560
but to launch an
initial product and then

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.440
kind of see what happens.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.060
So in all this experience
I've accumulated,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.027
probably maybe the
most important lesson--

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.860
the most important
lesson is probably always

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.570
work with good people.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.530
Whoever your investors are,
you can't fire your investors.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.870
You need to select carefully
who you end up working with.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.010
But also a match between
the financing source

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.480
and where you are as
a company in terms

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.789
of the potential of the market,
the potential of the team

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.039
and everything.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.280
And often people think,
you're only a great company

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.289
if you raise VC eventually.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.720
That's just so not true.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.870
That's probably 1 in a
100 interesting startups

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.750
is really suitable for
VC at the beginning.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.200
And it depends a
little on the stage,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.000
a little bit on the potential,
and also the potential

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.630
may only discover over time.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.616
So I think that's the
great and also-- great

00:09:05.616 --> 00:09:07.490
other ways of getting
company off the ground.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.420
And one of the things every
good entrepreneur is focused on

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.070
is dilutions.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.232
So you want to be
kept really-- you

00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:16.190
want to be capital
efficient, but also dilution

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.860
efficient from the beginning.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.520
And I think that often
means-- mean crowdfunding is

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.610
a great way to get pretty
much non-dilutive capital

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.220
for a product.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.690
But whether it's friends
and family money,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.190
incubators, accelerators,
angels-- and then of course VCs

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.330
have been going to
very early stage

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.350
funding as well, where you
have a number of VCs writing

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.090
$100,000 to let's say a
$500,000 checks with very, very

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.210
low barrier to getting a deal
done, which can be attractive.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.210
But it's attractive
in terms of you

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.140
get capital relatively
easily and quickly.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.150
But the question then
is, is that actually

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.660
the right VC to help you build
the company in the long term.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.150
Is VC the right sort
of financing to build

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.880
that company long term?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.190
So I guess we can
zoom in to all of that

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.020
as the evening progresses.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.082
And I guess I'll stop here
with the introduction.

00:10:14.082 --> 00:10:14.790
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.710
Well, before I ask
Julianne to speak,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.735
Axel has been here before
to talk about this.

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.540
And as I was putting together
the panel thinking, who's

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.870
the right mix of
people, it struck me

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.980
that your recent venture Bolt
fit well with nuts and bolts.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.320
But I did ask you
to figure out who

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.000
I could get for the nut part.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.586
So we haven't figured
that one out yet.

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:40.150
Welcome.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.200
Julianne, you're not
the nut by any means.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.420
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: Well,
I guess we'll leave that up

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.960
to the audience to decide.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.007
So before launching into
my background and my focus

00:10:53.007 --> 00:10:55.090
and my reason for being
here on the panel tonight,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.400
let me just say that the
thing that I hope all of you

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.525
recognize by the end of tonight,
if you don't already know it,

00:11:03.525 --> 00:11:09.240
is that every form of
capital has a use and a cost.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.050
And different forms of
capital are appropriate

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.350
not only at different
stages, as Axel said,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.570
but for different
kinds of businesses.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.740
So you've already
been challenged

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.090
in your first session in

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.220
And to a lesser extent
again, in second session,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.380
to think about why
you're doing this

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.940
and what you ultimately
aim to accomplish.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.590
The answer to that question
is really important

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.180
for a variety of
reasons, not least

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.870
of which is to guide
you in making decisions

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.070
about the appropriate
resources to call upon

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.160
to achieve that goal.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.070
And one of those being capital.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.930
And there are very, very
different kinds of capital

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.270
that have different
uses, different benefits,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.090
and different costs.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.680
And by the way, I can't
remember the number, Joe.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.460
You might know it.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.485
But it's a minority
fraction of companies

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:02.050
that they go to IPO that
were ever venture funded.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.770
It's something less
than a quarter.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.650
It's like 16% or 17% percent.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.950
Do you remember, Axel.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.340
AXEL BICHARA: I bet it's
less than that, actually.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.510
And so many of the
great wealth creation

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.870
stories I found who never
have raised money, or just

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.370
raised tiny amounts of money
and kept it all for themselves.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.547
If you can pull it
off, it's a great way--

00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:28.880
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: So there
are lots of preconceptions,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.820
as Axel mentioned about, it's
only a really good company

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.440
if it's venture backed
or you only really

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.790
have steep growth potential, if
you can attract venture money.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.950
I really hope that by
the end of this evening,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.230
we've really completely
dispelled those preconceptions

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.160
from your mind.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.530
So about me, I'm also an alumna.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.690
I came here in the mid '80s.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.180
I double majored in aerospace
engineering and literature,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.440
neither of which
would lead anybody

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.880
to imagine that I'd be on
this panel here tonight.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.215
And my first career was in the
manned space flight business.

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:08.640
It was a great first career.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.770
When I came to the end
of that first career,

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.000
I was looking for
something that was equally

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.050
challenging and very different.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.620
And I ended up co-founding
a company called

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.700
Greenfuel Technologies
before there

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.149
was such a thing as clean tech.

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:25.940
As a matter of fact,
at that point in time,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.110
the greens and browns feared and
loathed each other, absolutely

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.040
wanted nothing to
do with one another.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.730
And here we were
founding a company

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.220
that was algae biofuels.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:42.130
And I'm very proud of the fact
that in the time that company

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.360
was alive, we actually
managed to change

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.970
the tenor of those exchanges.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.740
In fact, we ended up
being frequently featured

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.230
in industry magazines like
Industrial Light and Power,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.930
which is about as far as
you can get from Mother

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.600
Jones in the known universe.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.380
So I've been on the entrepreneur
side of the table, too.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.900
One of the things that
is important to notice

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:17.230
about that is we raised about
$23 million in-- good evening.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:24.570
We raised about $23 million, had
a very interesting proposition,

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.930
made some mistakes, encountered
significant obstacles,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.460
had a good team.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.820
And when the market cratered
and project finance went away,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.320
we defaulted on all
their contracts.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.520
And that was the
end of the company.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.870
So there are many
things that can trip you

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:51.720
up that have nothing to do with
the things that you thought of

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.280
or the things that
you planned on.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.290
Interestingly enough in
the entrepreneurial realm,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.890
having a company crater
is not necessarily

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.660
the death knell of your
career as an entrepreneur.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.390
I went on to be involved in
a handful of other companies.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.460
By then, there was such
thing as clean tech.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.200
And having been
involved before there

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:19.280
was even a commonly understood
wave or trend or segment,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:30.403
I was-- a venture mentoring
service, clean tech open,

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:39.180
the 100K-- mentoring and judging
a bunch of really interesting

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.250
startups, some of which never
actually went on to launch.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.330
Many, in fact, didn't.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.610
But the teams would join
and break part and reform.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.560
And that's probably
something that you also

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.530
talk about in terms of the way
that you form teams together.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.390
As Axel mentioned, really
above all, the most important

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.305
decision you make
every day is who

00:16:03.305 --> 00:16:05.945
to work with-- who to work
with on your team, who

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:11.630
to work with as investors,
who to work with as partners,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.030
who to work with as vendors.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.736
Ultimately that is far and away
the most important decision

00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:19.360
you make.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.410
So having done all this
mentoring and judging

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.380
and blah blah blah, of
course I found myself

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.550
drifting perilously
close to pretending I

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.210
knew something useful.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.670
And a friend and
colleague and I had

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.530
been discussing
for about two years

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.545
some trends we saw going
on-- not exclusively

00:16:41.545 --> 00:16:44.234
here in the Boston area,
but especially here

00:16:44.234 --> 00:16:45.970
in the entrepreneurial
community.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.870
And it's slowly
dawned on us that we

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.120
had what sounded an awful lot
like an investment thesis.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.250
So in a very
entrepreneurial way,

00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:02.840
we wrote that down, started
showing it to people.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.947
Keeping things secret is
not a great way to start.

00:17:05.947 --> 00:17:07.280
We started showing it to people.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.849
We showed it to
everybody we thought

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.220
would be able to
give us a candid

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.940
response to the question,
is this completely wrong?

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.300
What have we gotten wrong
and what have we missed?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.780
What have we imagined?

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.170
What have we left out?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.680
Why will this not work?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.869
And we did that for
about five months.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.920
And we got some great
feedback and we ended up

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.190
founding and new seed
stage venture firm

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.250
here in Boston area
called Vodia Ventures.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.290
That firm is now a year
old and we are still

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.980
raising our first
fund, so we are also,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.540
as Joe alluded, we also raise
capital for our investors.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.140
And we've done
four deals so far.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.630
So we've made four
investments in companies

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.220
here in the Boston area.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.030
And we don't focus on
clean tech, per se.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.680
We invest in segments
that people often

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.570
associate with
clean tech-- energy,

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.290
air, water, food
security, public health,

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.654
are the two that kind of
don't fit the clean tech set.

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:14.320
And I'd be happy to
talk with any of you

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.770
afterwards about why
those sectors are--

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.220
why are we doing that.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.150
But the thing that
I'd really like

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.120
to finish up this sort of
background monologue on

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.860
is, when you are
thinking that you

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:36.570
might want to go to an outside
investor to fund your company,

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.660
as Joe alluded and as
Axel did as well, it's

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.725
really important not only
to know what kind of money

00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:47.630
you want and how much and
how much dilution you're

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.640
willing to accept and what
an appropriate model is

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.560
for your stage and all the
rest, but are your interests

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.790
and investor's interests
actually aligned?

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.220
Do you share the same interests?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.010
You're going to be working with
this person, an actual person,

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:11.610
very intimately for an
extended period of time.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.260
And so you really do want
to be very, very careful.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.520
You don't want to
send your elevator

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.420
pitch or your
presentation to everybody

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.440
you think might
possibly be interested.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.390
You really want to
be very selective, as

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.700
selective as you are
about your team members,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.760
in picking the people
you think you probably

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.690
are going to share a good
working relationship with.

00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:40.660
PROFESSOR: Amir, thank you.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.040
I know it's hard getting in.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.550
But I just wanted
to fill you in.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.930
Same format as before.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.997
We're introducing the class
to financing sources--

00:19:50.997 --> 00:19:53.080
where do you get your
money, what do you look for,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.621
and then we're going to have a
discussion about the financing

00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:57.800
environment and all of
those sort of things.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.980
So Amir, go ahead.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.580
AMIR NASHAT: I'm extremely
sorry for being late.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.620
Getting lost on
campus, I suppose.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.770
So my background
is that I actually

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.590
was lucky enough
to do my PhD here

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.290
on campus in a lab in chemical
engineering, Bob Winger's lab.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.560
I currently am a managing
partner at Polaris.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.870
We've had probably about 25
years of investing in Boston.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.930
As Polaris, we're going
on about 18 years now.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.960
My partners had worked
in another firm.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.530
We invest in all kinds of stuff.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.795
We're a pretty traditional
venture capital firm,

00:20:32.795 --> 00:20:34.990
I would say.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.740
And we kind of stick
to the old model

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.481
from the '80s and the
'90s of how to invest.

00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:42.480
Again, my background, I
was a chemical engineer.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.396
I actually wanted to go
work at a startup that

00:20:44.396 --> 00:20:47.570
was being spun out
of Bob's lab, and I

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.387
had a very simple logical train
of thought which was my adviser

00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:53.970
and another guy on
my thesis committee

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.290
were both starting a company.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.511
And I figured that if I took
a job at their new startup

00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:01.760
since they were desperate
to find employee number one,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.610
the chances they would let
me stand well for my thesis

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.900
and not ask tough
questions was very high.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.170
So I said sure, I'll go
work at your startup.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.320
And then what ended up
happening was just randomly

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.770
I ended up interviewing
with-- so it was being seed

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.790
funded by a series of
venture capitalists

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.300
at a company called Polaris
I've never heard of before.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.040
I had actually briefly worked
at Goldman Sachs-- can people

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.400
hear me OK or-- I briefly
worked at Goldman Sachs

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.630
in fixed income
trading stuff briefly.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.530
And I had never heard
of venture capital.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.810
And venture capital
is the freckle

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.880
of the freckle in the
financial markets.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.014
It's such a small
industry financially.

00:21:38.014 --> 00:21:39.180
So I no idea what to expect.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.130
I had no idea who
these guys were.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.610
But kind of interview after
interview, I was smart enough

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.860
to realize they were probably
actually interviewing me

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.276
for Polaris, because
I don't think

00:21:48.276 --> 00:21:51.430
I need to meet the guy that
founded 3Com and created

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.250
ethernet to get a lab job.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.470
And so little by little
I started to ask around

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.690
and they seemed like people that
would be really good teachers.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.740
And that's kind of what
I've done most of my life,

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.700
including as a
venture capitalist.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.020
I just kind of associate
myself with people

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.210
that have something to teach me
and some really good mentors--

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.930
whether that's
people I work with

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.910
or whether that's the
entrepreneurs in our companies

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.790
and people we surround
ourselves on boards with.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.930
And so that's kind of what I do.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.275
Within that context, we've
started several companies

00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:28.090
that I've been CEO of that
we've spun out of MIT.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.216
Sun Catalytics is one
in the energy space.

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:33.590
A consumer product
company called

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.685
Living Proof is another one
that's more kind of materials

00:22:36.685 --> 00:22:38.710
and consumer products.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.770
Provasis Therapeutics was
a cell therapy company

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.550
that we spun out of
the lab here at MIT.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.729
So there's been a
series of companies.

00:22:46.729 --> 00:22:48.020
Again, I'm not an entrepreneur.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.240
I'm not very entrepreneurial.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880
I did those projects
just because it

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.707
seemed like it was really
logical technology that

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:56.873
was going to help change
the world and nobody wanted

00:22:56.873 --> 00:22:58.406
to be CEO but me.

00:22:58.406 --> 00:23:03.150
But as venture capitalists, we
follow other people's leads.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.080
We're actually quite
conservative in some sense.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.590
And that's kind of
maybe what we try to do.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.010
With that said,
obviously we take

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.210
much, much greater risk than any
other investors tend to take.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.940
But we view ourselves as
kind of chicken shits,

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.090
for lack of a better term.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.950
And say anyway,
that's kind of us.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.875
That's me, and I don't
know what else I can say.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.620
PROFESSOR: So I think this
would be a good point just

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.120
to maybe start some Q&A if
people have some questions.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.910
Otherwise I have some
things I can T up.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.050
But is there any pressing issues
that anybody in the audience

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.180
has?

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.990
There we go.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:05.200
AXEL BICHARA: So it's
like any deal you do.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.450
You give up a bunch of equity.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.360
You get some capital.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.070
And kind of what
you get in return.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.990
And there are many incubators,
which are typically

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.150
sort of-- if you desk a
little bit of mentoring

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.640
and an internet connection.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.845
In accelerators,
you often have sort

00:24:24.845 --> 00:24:28.980
of a multi-focused program,
just more value added

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.060
and one dimensional another.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.709
So I think the short answer
is, do your homework.

00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:34.500
Who are the people?

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.624
What have they done before?

00:24:35.624 --> 00:24:39.910
What kind of real work
are they going to do?

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:47.580
And how committed are the
people you're working with?

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.970
Is it sort of a loosely
connected network

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.160
of people helping out?

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.230
Are there people involved
who have full time

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.825
dedicated to making
the companies they

00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:57.700
work with successful?

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.310
And obviously there needs to
be a fit with your objective.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.580
Is your objective too--
I got some introductions.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.530
I'm networking,
financing sources,

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.480
or are you looking for some
help to really build a product,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.140
help you build the team?

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.970
Step back and figure out,
what financing sources

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.960
should I go after and
who are these guys?

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.150
How can they help me figure
out what the best path is.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.765
So when we started
Bolt, we saw the need

00:25:29.765 --> 00:25:33.180
for entrepreneurs who
have a piece of hardware

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.880
as part of their offering
basically totally grinding

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.740
to a halt in traditional sort
of software accelerator settings

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.550
where the expertise
simply isn't there.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.230
And it's much harder
to build hardware

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.960
than it is to build
an iPhone app.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.950
And so we built-- we have
a big machine shop where

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.020
you can build anything.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.480
We have a full time
staff, engineering staff,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.020
that helps you products done.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.700
And then people like me on the
financing, company building,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.014
team building, strategy side.

00:26:08.014 --> 00:26:09.680
But there's a full
spectrum, from things

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.221
that are really
lightweight to things

00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:12.480
that are fairly involved.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.960
We're probably more
on the involved side.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.000
But there's no good or bad.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.976
It's really what's a fit
with what you're looking for.

00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:26.800
PROFESSOR: Axel, Y
Combinator kind of program

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.110
where you get accepted,
there's sort of a set formula

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.700
about we'll give you x dollars
for y percent of your company--

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.010
is that how you work
or is it a set formula?

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.170
AXEL BICHARA: We have, I
would say, a default formula,

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.900
and then there are exceptions
to the rule depending

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.410
on specific circumstances.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:48.340
For instance, if a company has
raised a bunch of venture money

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:48.840
already.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.680
So we're not just
working with companies

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.950
that are-- three guys out
of MIT and the slide deck.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.249
Some offers are long.

00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:57.790
Some have been
software entrepreneurs

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.560
before, are looking for
the expertise to getting

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.960
a piece of hardware to market.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.950
So if the company has,
for instance, raised

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.680
a bunch of venture capital,
sort of the totally formulaic

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.190
approach of a Y
Combinator wouldn't work.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.644
So we have the formula
and then the rule,

00:27:14.644 --> 00:27:16.560
and then the exception
to the rule, basically.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.110
And my philosophy
and our philosophy

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.580
is, if there's a good company
and a good entrepreneur

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.330
that we want to
work with, there's

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.714
a way to get a deal done that
makes sense for everybody.

00:27:27.714 --> 00:27:30.130
PROFESSOR: Are you willing to
tell us the default formula?

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:30.921
AXEL BICHARA: Yeah.

00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:35.320
The default formula is, we
take 10% of common stock.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.180
We put in 50K.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.100
But the main thing you get
is you work with us for six

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.470
to nine months basically
around the clock helping

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.360
build product,
helping build team,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.880
get the company set
up for financing.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.980
And there's often
the discussion, well,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.450
it's only 50K.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.320
What's evaluation?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320
You kind of do the math.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.060
And the answer I normally
give is, let's take the 50K.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.444
Give it to a charity.

00:28:03.444 --> 00:28:05.860
The reason for coming here is
everything else we're doing.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.200
It's not the 50K.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.710
So it's very much
a company building

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.440
is a value we provide in
this particular case, which

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.250
is really diametrically
opposed from what

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.330
I did in the past, which was
big VC firm where it's really

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.190
all about the capital.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.770
But that goes back to
what stage are you at

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.170
and what do you need help with?

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.460
And maybe one more comment
on the hardware thing--

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.520
in the amount of money
and time companies

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.480
I invested at Atlas that was
wasted because we made kind

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.230
of beginner's mistakes
in getting hardware

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.920
products to market
would have been

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.645
significant value added if
something like Bolt had exited,

00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:50.925
even for a VC
company at the time.

00:28:50.925 --> 00:28:54.030
AMIR NASHAT: Can I make one
comment about incubators?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.710
And as Axel put, now come in
different shapes and sizes.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.640
One thing I noticed as a
voyeur at Dogpatch Labs.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.540
We had set up Dogpatch
Labs some years ago.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.570
It's now exists within
Cambridge Innovation Center.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.666
It's more the value of being
around other people when

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:12.290
you're trying to
evaluate these places.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.730
One is the services
they provide.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.270
The other is actually
the value of being

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.370
around sitting next to someone
who's doing better than you,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.940
and how that motivates
you, and there's

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.190
this competitive
dynamic that kicks in.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.540
And you could watch it actually.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.760
Whenever I would
over there, someone

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.790
would get off the
phone with Pepsi

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.100
and they were talking to
some VD person over there.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.290
And you could see the other
teams around them really kind

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.456
of-- what have I done today?

00:29:35.456 --> 00:29:38.377
Maybe I'm a biotech or maybe I'm
a software company or something

00:29:38.377 --> 00:29:39.960
and I've got nothing
to do with Pepsi.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.084
But it just gets you
thinking, what did I do today?

00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:44.600
And you could feel
the energy that grew.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.580
So I think surrounding yourself
in an environment where

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.240
it feels like people
are quite intense

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.190
is actually
surprisingly valuable.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.150
And I think for a lot
of people that benefit

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.660
from going into
these environments,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.830
whether it's an incubator
or accelerator or anything

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.920
else-- sitting at home alone
and having to motivate yourself

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.830
is actually quite
difficult a lot.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.000
It's like going to the gym.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.001
Some days you're great
and some days you're not.

00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:07.750
It just kind of helps
if you're at the gym

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.200
with a bunch of
other people that

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.420
are kind of running
around acting like they're

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.710
lifting a lot of weight.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.461
So I just think
that's one part I

00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:15.710
would look at when I evaluate.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.900
It is a soft factors.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.390
It's obviously
not a hard factor.

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:23.522
PROFESSOR: We have
some other questions?

00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:24.438
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we haven't
covered that in the class,

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.320
so if you want to
just take a moment

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.216
and explain it to the
people that don't know.

00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:40.340
AXEL BICHARA: Oh, explain?

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.940
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: Sure.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.440
Go ahead.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.770
AXEL BICHARA: So explain
convertible note?

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:51.345
So an equity deal is
not a convertible note.

00:30:51.345 --> 00:30:52.220
I'll start with that.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.190
Equity deal is you basically
sell shares in your company.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.700
You give away a percentage for
the capital that gets invested.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.270
Convertible note is basically
you basically borrow money

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.610
and you owe that money
back to the investors

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.650
unless there's an event
under which the note converts

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.900
into equity.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.607
So may or may not
convert into equity

00:31:13.607 --> 00:31:15.440
depending on what the
terms of the note are.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.380
Often somebody
does, as an example,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.420
let's say, $500,000
convertible note

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.310
that has a term that says it
converts into the next equity

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.070
round of financing off a
million dollars or more.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.830
And so if there's such
an equity financing,

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.690
it converts and there's
some other terms

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.030
like a discount interest rate.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.420
Or it may not convert
if the company,

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.880
for instance-- well, if it goes
bankrupt, the money's gone.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.180
If the company is
acquired, there's

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:49.270
typically a term where you get
1 and 1/2 to 3 times your money

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.030
back of the note.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.855
So that's kind of the basics.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.270
So why did convertible
notes become so popular?

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.470
It's very easy and
quick to get done.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.050
It's a one to two page document.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.480
And as an entrepreneur,
you get the money quickly

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.530
and there's no more
complicated legal documents

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.710
to do an actual equity deal.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.380
On the flip side is,
you owe the money.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.570
It's debt until it converts.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:25.220
And normally the rule with
debt is that if things go well,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.930
it's a good thing to have taken.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.510
If things don't go so well,
you may end up regretting it.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.450
Now in many startups,
things don't go so well.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.221
So you just need to kind of
think the different scenarios

00:32:35.221 --> 00:32:35.720
through.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.420
We actually had a discussion
earlier today with a VC

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.100
in one of the Bolt companies.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.610
So do we do a convertible
note deal or an equity deal?

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:50.120
I could argue either side.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.840
But maybe as a rule, if you're
talking about raising $250,000,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.980
$500,000 and you're likely
to raise more money,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.840
like whatever, another
million plus a year

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.590
later, it's not a
bad thing to do.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.390
It's a quick way to get started,
low legal fees and everything.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:14.510
By the time you reach $2 million
or more in convertible note,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.250
it's just odd.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.300
There's this amount of money you
have spent that's converting,

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.910
that's going to be dilutive.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.660
It's starting to be
a biggish amount.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.890
What if the pre money is
$4 million, let's say.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.390
Well, already $2 million
converting at $4 million pre,

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.080
a third of the company
is already gone.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.370
So I would say up to $500,000,
a million, $1.5 million maximum.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.965
If I see a convertible
note at more than that,

00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:44.090
it's probably starting to
get pretty uncomfortable.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.078
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:52.912 --> 00:33:53.780
AXEL BICHARA: Right.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.870
Where they would not do it.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.820
One way to think about
it is, it really depends

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.060
upon the terms of the note.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.630
If you go in and
there's something

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.800
called a cap or no cap.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.530
Basically a valuation
cap or note.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.659
So let's say I give you
a note for like 500K

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.239
and it has no cap on
it, so it converts

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.739
in some future financing.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.300
So you're actually
using my money

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.480
to increase the value of
the company, which I then

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.530
buy shares at.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.456
So some VCs actually do
that and it's all about

00:34:25.456 --> 00:34:27.580
competing with the next
guy, get a foot in the door

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.699
with some interesting
entrepreneur.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.790
But from a purely
financial standpoint,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.199
it's actually kind of
crazy to loan somebody

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.909
the money-- it's
typically 2% interest

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:41.420
rate to increase evaluation,
in which you then invest.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.134
The other effects-- if
you are a note holder,

00:34:44.134 --> 00:34:45.550
you're actually
not a shareholder.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.310
So you won't get a board seat.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:51.310
So that's one.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:57.430
But for many investors--
understanding thee objective

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.350
of the investors is
actually important.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.550
Like for many venture
firms especially,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.425
it's a foot in the door.

00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:08.160
You care about the option
value of doing a deal later.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.150
So if that's the valuation,
the main objective,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.370
that's kind of one thing.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:20.160
Now if all the money
the company will need

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.130
is let's say $1 million--
it's a bunch of angels

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:30.550
and they really help you to
work on the deal-- understanding

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.760
the objective is actually
very, very important.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.060
Do you have alignment of
interests or actually conflict

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.600
of interests?

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.430
Is the objective
of the investors

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.970
to increase your
evaluation or not?

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:45.740
So there's actually
no simple answer.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.965
There's something beautiful
about an equity deal.

00:35:48.965 --> 00:35:50.090
You have aligned interests.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.120
You own more or less--
preferred versus common--

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.840
but it's more or less the
same shares in the company.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.447
So on the margin, I actually
tend to prefer equity deals.

00:35:59.447 --> 00:36:01.030
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
So if I could just

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.100
expand on Axel's comments.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.320
Remember I said at the beginning
that every form of equity

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.630
has its intended use, it's
benefits and it's costs, right?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.960
So as Axel said, a note tends
to be a really good instrument

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.370
when you are expecting
there to be fairly

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.690
rapid succession of events.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.550
So you're going to
hit some milestones.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.990
You expect to
raise more capital.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.550
It's an opportunity for
you and the investors,

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.240
when your interests
are aligned, to do

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.950
a relatively lightweight deal.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.490
It's relatively
inexpensive to do.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.430
It's relatively quick.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.810
You don't have to
agree on evaluation

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.250
when things are in
flux, which is also

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.190
easier for both parties.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.180
And the advantage for
you as the founder is you

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.570
haven't already committed a
portion of the company away.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.210
You have the opportunity
to hit those milestones

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.300
and justify evaluation.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.060
The advantage for
the investor, again,

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.020
might be the optionality.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.820
So the option itself
have value to them.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.600
It might be that they like
the idea that their note will

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.030
convert at advantageous
terms in the next round,

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:14.080
and that's when the cap and
the other terms come in.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.880
But again, the purpose
of a note is really

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.600
kind of a temporary instrument.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.425
It's not designed to
be long term instrument

00:37:24.425 --> 00:37:27.090
and it's not intended
to be a kind of one

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.130
off or permanent instrument.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.780
It comes due.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.400
It has a termination date.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.410
So on the date when it matures,
you either have to go back

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.370
and say we need an extension or
you have to pay back that money

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.260
or you have to have a subsequent
funding round in order

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.150
for the note to convert.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.360
So what you want
to keep in mind is

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.800
that's what it's designed to be.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.600
It's designed to be
an interim instrument.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.106
Does that make sense?

00:37:56.106 --> 00:37:58.660
AMIR NASHAT: If I can make
one cautionary statement

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.749
with notes-- in
general, I think if I

00:38:00.749 --> 00:38:02.540
was an entrepreneur
I'd tried to take notes

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.265
if I could, because
I'm paying you Tuesday

00:38:05.265 --> 00:38:07.560
which is in stock for
a hamburger today,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.126
which is the cash you give me.

00:38:09.126 --> 00:38:10.750
The one thing you
have to watch out for

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.220
is if I gave you
$100,000 in equity

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.600
and I own 5% of your company,
things go sideways whatnot,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.990
I own 5% of your company.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.410
So you may not like me.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.260
We may be in an argument,
but I'm a minor shareholder.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.070
And most of the controls
is in your hands.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.610
If the company goes belly
up with it's $100,000 note,

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.430
I'm a creditor
actually, which means

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.110
your intellectual property and
a whole host of other things

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.680
show up in court and I'm first
in line probably, unless you've

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.270
taken other loans.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:43.000
So my power becomes extremely
strong for the same $100,000.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.750
So you really don't
want to screw up

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.860
a note you never
want to borrow money

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.774
when you're close to the edge.

00:38:49.774 --> 00:38:51.940
If you feel really good
about how things are, or you

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.920
do what are called auto
converts, where at your option,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.315
the note converts to equity, if
investors will give you that.

00:38:58.315 --> 00:38:59.120
A lot of them wont.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.830
But if they allow you to auto
convert at some evaluation,

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.540
then you never really
owe them the money.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.445
It will get converted to equity.

00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:08.137
But be careful about
owing people money,

00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:09.595
because they become
the controllers

00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:11.595
and it's a court process,
which nobody controls.

00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:17.698
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:48.946 --> 00:39:50.890
AMIR NASHAT: How do you
define structural fit

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:51.520
versus strategic?

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:16.280
AMIR NASHAT: Let me
start with the first part

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.610
of your question, which
was the presumption that

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.790
kind of alignment
might be different.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.020
I think you should be
really careful taking money

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.870
from people where you don't feel
like there's 100% alignment.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.430
Every one of my
entrepreneurs and I, I hope,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.980
have the same exact goal.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.650
If you don't, it can
get quite tricky.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.650
And then in later rounds,
strategics come in,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.790
people come in.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.830
Maybe objectives
shift a little bit.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.810
My price point maybe
lower for my stock

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.040
than somebody that led a
very later stage round,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.965
so our sensitivities to certain
events may be different.

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:52.590
But in general I
think everybody better

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.715
be rooting for the same
thing, which is the company

00:40:54.715 --> 00:40:56.100
to be successful.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.040
And that's one of the
reasons I would always

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.340
worry about people with too
much of a strategic interest.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.840
Because a lot of
our bio-techs bring

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.870
money from corporate partners,
pharmaceutical companies.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.070
A lot of times they're kind
of interested in the company,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.900
but they're really interested
in a particular asset.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.600
And we have to excuse
them from the room

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.490
when we have
strategic discussions,

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.605
because we're trying to play
them against other pharma.

00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:23.480
It makes it somewhat of
an awkward situation.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.940
It's very workable.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.820
But it's not the same
as having someone

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.250
you really trust that you can
just be totally open with.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:35.760
So every VC obviously has a
Rolodex, a series of people,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.390
a network, that they
bring to the table.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.100
But if you've got a group
that's very, very specifically

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.650
interested in a particular
piece of intellectual property

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.840
or a strategic fit or
something like that,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.450
you have to be careful that
your company doesn't drift away

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.750
from that or that there aren't
moments where you really

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.006
can't be as frank with
them as you'd like to be.

00:41:55.922 --> 00:41:59.060
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: I think
that's a really lucid answer.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.640
What I would say is that
people throw around the word

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.230
strategic, and as
you heard just now,

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:11.380
strategic meant two different
things in the same sentence.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:16.720
So the way that I like
to think about it is,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.790
do we all agree what success is?

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.450
Does success mean the
same thing to all of us?

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.960
How will we know
that we've succeeded?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.970
And if the answer is
we've gotten $100 million

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.280
or whatever figure it is,
that's not a useful answer,

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.590
because there's a semi-infinite
number of trajectories

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.060
that pass through that point.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.600
So what are the things that we
all care about accomplishing,

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:47.700
and do we share compatible
ideas about what it will take

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.590
to accomplish that success?

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:57.000
So in the course of starting
and growing any company,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.740
you're putting yourself
in, by definition,

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.200
a high conflict environment.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.090
You always have more things
to do than you can do.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.220
You always have
decisions to make

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.130
in an absence of
complete knowledge,

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.880
so you never have complete
intelligence ever,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.080
even when you really good
situational awareness,

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.010
you never have
complete intelligence.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.675
So even when everybody
is really tightly aligned

00:43:22.675 --> 00:43:26.170
and everybody shares the same
objectives, the same goals,

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.150
the same motivations,
you're going

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.370
to have honest
differences of opinion.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.930
If you have divergent
notions of what success is

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.180
or what we care about,
you have a problem.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.480
You don't just have legitimate
differences of opinion

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.080
about how to solve an
agreed upon problem,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.180
you have different
definitions of the problem.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.140
That can get very
ugly very quickly,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.240
and it can just be disaster.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.640
So ultimately what
you really want

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.240
to be sure of is that everybody
on your team, everybody

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.420
internally, your
investors, everybody,

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.480
agrees on what success means.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.850
What do we aim to accomplish?

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.060
How do we win collectively,
all of us together.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.640
How do we win?

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.610
And then you have
the recipe to be

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.930
able to deal with all
of those uncertainties

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.315
and all those decision
points in a productive way.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.692
some sense of what
scale of money

00:44:35.692 --> 00:44:38.989
is involved in your experience
in making investments

00:44:38.989 --> 00:45:04.172
in [INAUDIBLE] could be as big
as [INAUDIBLE] or as much money

00:45:04.172 --> 00:45:07.930
as [INAUDIBLE] a
sense of perspective.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:10.122 --> 00:45:12.760
AXEL BICHARA: I can try that.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:20.070
I mean, a typical seed
financing, angel financings,

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.490
250K would be really small.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.490
$500 million, I would say up to
$2 million, $3 million of angel

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.800
is pretty doable these days.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.360
Valuations, again,
talking about a vacuum

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.700
is always, always tricky.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.070
But there are a few deals
that get done at less than $3

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.640
million pre, I would say.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.555
And $5 million or $6 million pre
is a lot for a million dollar

00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:46.500
angel round.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.810
No VCs start at 100K with a foot
in the door kind of strategy

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:56.870
and typically A
rounds are these days

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.845
whatever-- three, two,
$6 million, $7 million

00:45:59.845 --> 00:46:01.270
in the tech world.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:05.930
Bio tech obviously is
much bigger numbers.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:10.840
There are definitely VCs and
also, depending a little bit

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.140
on the backgrounds of
founders, plays where you

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.120
raise a lot of money quickly.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.430
One company that I
helped get off the ground

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:24.260
called On Shape we raised
an A round of $9 million

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:29.970
in November of 2012 and we
raised a B round of $25 million

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.460
in April of this year.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.480
It was the all-star team
going after big opportunity

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.280
and some VCs was very like
multi-billion fund saying,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.157
this is a big play.

00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:41.990
I want to be in there,
and kind of paying up

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.781
to do a deal early.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:48.330
And that happens up
two $100 million rounds

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:54.630
to if a VC firm is convinced
that there's an emerging market

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.700
segment or some really
interesting disruption going

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:03.140
on, by piling a lot
of money you obviously

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.360
acquire a meaningful
ownership as a VC,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.910
but you also help establish--
if you're executing well--

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:12.830
help establish the
success of the company.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.870
It would be very
hard for competitors

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.740
to raise money if you have
$100 million into bank already.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.390
So there's all kinds of--
especially sort of in emerging

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.695
winners, you look at, oh,
these are crazy evaluations,

00:47:24.695 --> 00:47:25.770
They're crazy deals.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.380
If you really look
at it, they may not

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.710
be the crazy if
it is an emerging

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.148
winner in a multi-billion
market disruption, for instance.

00:47:37.892 --> 00:47:43.480
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: So
again, I would say-- sorry.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.805
Again I would say, there
are so many different kinds

00:47:45.805 --> 00:47:46.900
of companies.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.900
And remember that
we've all commented

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.770
that venture money,
professional money,

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:59.810
is a very small segment
of company finance.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:05.540
So I would say the way I would
answer that is starting from 0,

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.850
the lower end is zero.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.810
You take no outside money.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.610
And there have
been companies that

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:15.600
have famously gone bust after
taking in more than $100

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.856
million.

00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:21.780
So there's an
extremely wide range.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:31.420
The appeal that I think
tends to get overblown

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.350
in a lot of the press
coverage of big deals

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:35.870
is it sounds very sexy.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:36.730
It's very exciting.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.710
It sounds like a
lot of momentum.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.880
And that's the intention
of a big round certainly.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.205
But there's also, again, there
are always costs and always

00:48:47.205 --> 00:48:47.705
downsides.

00:48:47.705 --> 00:48:50.690
The downside is, if you take
a huge amount of capital--

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.450
whether that's hundreds of
millions for $10 million

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.324
depending on your
stage of development--

00:48:56.324 --> 00:48:57.865
if you take a huge
amount of capital,

00:48:57.865 --> 00:49:00.360
it also puts a tremendous
amount of pressure on you

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.240
to use that capital
very aggressively.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.590
And so companies have
also been blown up

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.380
by taking too much capital.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.370
So really what you
want to be doing

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:19.130
is focusing, again,
on Joe's questions.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.830
Whys?

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.610
What are all of the whys?

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.000
Why are you doing this?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.680
Why now?

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.960
Why this team?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.870
Why this amount of money?

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.240
Why this timing?

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.860
Why this instrument?

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.240
Why this firm?

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.320
Whatever.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.710
Because you really
want to be focused on

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:41.910
is this the right amount
of money for my company

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:45.950
to do what it is intended
to do at this point in time?

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:54.878
It's really easy to get
wildly out of balance there.

00:49:54.878 --> 00:49:55.790
AMIR NASHAT: Yeah.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:01.090
I mean, again, we write checks
as small as $50,000, $100,000

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.540
to get started.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.716
Our goal is probably $5
million to say $20 million

00:50:05.716 --> 00:50:07.340
in an investment.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.090
It's a wide range.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:09.798
If the company only
ever needs $1 million

00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:12.890
and we all know
that going into it,

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:14.810
it's probably not a
fit for us, because we

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.518
have a reasonably
large fund so we'd have

00:50:16.518 --> 00:50:17.890
to make so many small bets.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.320
It's perfectly fine if a
company only takes $1 million

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.380
and is either successful
or unsuccessful.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.230
Because we all learned
in a very quick way

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.110
that it was really great.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.090
You're never going to complain
if you took $1 million

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.480
and turn it into a big win.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.580
I have had a lot of co-investors
who complain about that.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.290
But my view is, come on.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.070
You've got to be kidding me.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.890
And then of course
we kind of sometimes

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:42.890
have to plan to put 20,
30 million hours through

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.750
to support our company.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.130
I think the fundamental
question is exactly the why.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:53.960
And for us, we are so focused
on backing entrepreneurs,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.950
every single deal we've
been in pretty much,

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.450
the intellectual
property shifted.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.990
Almost everything
about the deal changed.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.500
Very rarely does it work
exactly the way you want.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.130
The people are what
make it happen.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.930
And if a person doesn't
own a lot of it,

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:11.210
then why are they coming
to work every day?

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:14.840
So I think whenever we own a
venture entrepreneurial type

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.050
deal, whenever we
own a lot of company,

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.090
something went horribly wrong.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:23.912
And when we don't own a lot of
it and it's a great company,

00:51:23.912 --> 00:51:26.120
something's going great
because they're raising money

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.120
at great valuations.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.036
They don't need the money
to bring capital in.

00:51:29.036 --> 00:51:30.610
They give a shit about stock.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.120
They don't want
to give it to me.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.740
They don't want to
give it to anybody.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.500
They're going to charge a lot of
money for that share of stock.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.360
That's the best kinds
of deals we're in.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.880
Whenever we own
75% of a startup,

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.761
of a venture backed
company, it's

00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:44.510
because we had to
bridge them three times,

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.630
they had terrible financings.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.835
So I love it when entrepreneurs
say, I don't need your money.

00:51:50.835 --> 00:51:52.400
I'll do it some other way.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.520
I'll just take a little bit.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.410
Again, it puts you in
a precarious position.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:57.910
But it's exactly
what Julianne said,

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.241
which is once you raise
$100 million dollars,

00:52:00.241 --> 00:52:02.240
you need to generate $200
million, $300 million,

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.490
$400 million dollars
worth of exit

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.227
to keep your investors happy.

00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:07.310
They're all on your board.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.220
They're not going to let you
go down a path that's small.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.730
So your flexibility just
went out the window.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.270
They're going to push
you down a path that's

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:19.682
big return, big win, and that
may not be what you want to do.

00:52:19.682 --> 00:52:22.050
PROFESSOR: Let me--
in the materials,

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.404
there's a PowerPoint
on beginner's guide

00:52:25.404 --> 00:52:26.195
to venture capital.

00:52:26.195 --> 00:52:29.480
And if you haven't read it, you
should have before the class.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.360
But these guys
compete for capital

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.210
to invest in their funds.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:36.780
And they have to show a return
history to the people that

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.330
are going to invest in them.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:43.550
And one of the issues is that
when these guys put money

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.670
in your company, that's
when the stopwatch starts

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.110
on how fast are they
generating return.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.770
So you've got to
be prepared to have

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.110
everything running
as fast as you can

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.510
once that money comes in.

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.676
And they're going to push
you to it, because they've

00:52:57.676 --> 00:53:00.780
got to turn around and say, to
their investors, you gave us X

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.940
and we returned so
much time X. So even

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.750
if you can convince them
to invest in your company,

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.450
if you're not ready
to run like crazy,

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:13.110
if you don't have a model
that you think could work,

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.150
pedal to the floor,
it's going to be

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.440
a tension filled environment.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.420
Would you disagree?

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.480
AXEL BICHARA: I
would probably agree.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.581
PROFESSOR: Was there a question?

00:53:23.581 --> 00:53:24.330
Then I'll ask one.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.062
AXEL BICHARA:
There's one up there.

00:53:27.062 --> 00:53:28.020
All the way in the top.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.478
PROFESSOR: All the
way in the back.

00:53:29.478 --> 00:53:30.161
All right.

00:53:30.161 --> 00:53:31.155
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:30.298 --> 00:54:32.099
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
Well, so first of all--

00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:34.390
PROFESSOR: Maybe generalize
it so you could work it in.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.264
I was going to ask a
variation of that, which

00:54:36.264 --> 00:54:39.050
is what are the biggest problems
you see for people trying

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.466
to raise money, because that's
sort of what you're saying.

00:54:41.466 --> 00:54:43.152
I don't really
understand how they're--

00:54:43.152 --> 00:54:44.136
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:05.224 --> 00:55:07.140
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: So
here's the first thing.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.176
Or actually here's
the zero thing.

00:55:09.176 --> 00:55:16.600
The zero thing is you really
need to have not just exchanges

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.870
like this, but you need to
have meaningful exchanges

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.865
with someone who's
a mentor to you who

00:55:20.865 --> 00:55:26.520
can give you ongoing
sanity checks and guidance.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.130
This is my plug for the MIT
venture mentoring service.

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.560
It is the most amazing thing.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.760
It is free to you.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.420
Go sign up right now.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.590
I mean, seriously.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:36.120
Do not wait.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:36.810
Immediately.

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.750
Go immediately.

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.340
The premise of the venture
mentoring service is that these

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:48.640
amazing people, Joe included,
will spend time with you

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.790
to advise you and, under
the terms of the program,

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:58.820
cannot take any interest
in your business.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.800
And so it's purely
objective advice.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.535
It's in your interest, not even
in the business's interests,

00:56:05.535 --> 00:56:08.550
it's advising you
personally as founder.

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:11.360
So go get that.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.580
The first thing then
after that is, forgive me

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.580
if I'm reading too much
into your question,

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:20.480
but it sounds like you've
already have some tensions that

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.400
have already started.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.770
That's a warning sign.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:26.245
Klaxon's are going off.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.470
If you already have significant
frictions with someone

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:37.515
and you haven't even made a
financial transaction yet,

00:56:37.515 --> 00:56:39.140
I think you want to
step back and think

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.450
about where those
frictions are coming from.

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:47.610
Are they coming from legitimate
discussion points, things

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:49.770
that you're being challenged
to think about that

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:53.630
are in the interest of the
company you're founding,

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.750
or are they personal frictions?

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:59.070
Are they differences,
again, in objectives?

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.720
What's behind those frictions?

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.250
And are those
productive frictions?

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:08.770
So both of my fellow
panelists have

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:12.557
spoken about the
beneficial frictions

00:57:12.557 --> 00:57:14.015
that you can
encounter, whether its

00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:22.400
from peers or from advisers and
investors and incubator staff

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.260
pushing, pulling, tugging.

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.880
Those can be
productive frictions.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.640
But if you're
actually experiencing

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.820
a lot of discomfort, I think
you should listen to that.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:35.532
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:50.262 --> 00:57:54.055
AXEL BICHARA: I have--
it really depends

00:57:54.055 --> 00:57:55.180
on who you're working with.

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.400
But I'll answer your question
in a slightly different way.

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.200
When an investor funds
you, they probably

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.590
make a whole bunch of calls.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:04.637
Who are you?

00:58:04.637 --> 00:58:05.720
What have you done before?

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.053
What's it like to work with you?

00:58:07.053 --> 00:58:10.480
I'm often amazed how few
entrepreneurs actually

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.850
check out the investors.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:16.020
So if you take somebody on
your board as a lead investor,

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.090
call up three, four CEOs
they worked with before.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:24.140
I mean, I would say it's almost
irresponsible not to do it.

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.210
And it's not just,
oh, they're nice guys.

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:28.210
Do they have a Rolodex?

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.990
It's what happens when things
get difficult. Because they

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:37.460
will get difficult. How
have they behaved in follow

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.410
on financings, in work
with strategic investors,

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:44.566
at exit, management
team building.

00:58:44.566 --> 00:58:47.080
If there's a problem
with a founder/CEO,

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.990
how do they behave under
those circumstances.

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:54.810
So just do the reference checks.

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:57.930
Because as I said earlier,
they can fire you,

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.160
but you can't fire them.

00:59:02.856 --> 00:59:05.430
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: Did
that answer your question?

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:06.402
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:15.116 --> 00:59:16.740
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
Mechanically, there

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.950
are only three ways
that anybody gets deals.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.960
You go out and get them,
you get referred to them

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.900
by peers and folks
in your network,

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:29.171
or you get cold submissions.

00:59:29.171 --> 00:59:29.670
That's it.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:31.730
There are three mechanisms.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.290
Different firms
have different ways

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.870
of going out and getting them.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.400
And by and large,
the return on effort

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.150
for an entrepreneur for a
cold submission is pretty low.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:50.040
So if you're
someone thinking you

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.660
want to raise venture
funds at any scale,

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:59.780
it's in your interest to go see
who looks like the most likely

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.860
best fit for you and go
find a way to meet them.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.760
But really ultimately it's
important recognize that those

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.460
are the only three channels.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.210
There aren't any other channels.

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:15.455
Does that make sense?

01:00:15.455 --> 01:00:18.750
PROFESSOR: What role
do introductions have?

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.070
Referrals?

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.435
Entrepreneurs should be
building a full team of people.

01:00:23.435 --> 01:00:28.829
Is that an important part
of who surrounds them

01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:29.620
in your experience?

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.703
AXEL BICHARA: Wait, this
seems to be to questions.

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.182
Is a referral or the--

01:00:33.182 --> 01:00:36.040
PROFESSOR: In other words,
having a deal referred to you,

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.040
is that elevated higher in the
stack if you know the person

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.890
and how does an entrepreneur
who doesn't-- get into that

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:44.390
network?

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.510
Any advice on that?

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.670
AXEL BICHARA: Well, I would say
certainly anybody in this room

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.580
should be able to get an
introduction to any of us

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.080
with-- I mean, it
should be trivial.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.910
It's really not that hard at
all to get good introductions

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.334
and they absolutely do matter.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:00.500
And there's some that are
good, some that are great,

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.930
some that are not so good.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:05.180
But a lot of it is through
networking, who do you know,

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:09.240
and you absolutely want
to pursue investors

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.550
through strong introductions.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:11.650
It's a no-brainer.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.670
AMIR NASHAT: I'll
take that, I guess.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:41.090
It just really depends
on-- in the Langor Lab,

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:46.300
we used to have a formula
which was science--

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.780
you publish the paper in
science, you file the IP,

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.890
and you have animal data.

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:51.940
You're ready to roll.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.420
That works in general.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:02:02.900
But I think I think that there's
a point at which the technology

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.870
and innovation stops being
a series of questions

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.340
and it starts being
a series of answers.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.060
And I think what you
find is that that's

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.130
a good transition wherever
people who in academia like

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.580
to ask questions are no longer
really interested in pursuing

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.380
that.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.280
And what companies
like to do is create

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.730
answers-- a technical
translation of concept

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:25.130
into a product.

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:27.570
And the rigorous-ness
of the precision

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.200
of the answers and
all those things

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.526
becomes really important.

01:02:30.526 --> 01:02:31.650
And it just becomes boring.

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.566
It's very hard to get a
grad student to do it,

01:02:33.566 --> 01:02:34.570
for a postdoc to do it.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.940
So I think that tends to be the
point at which it kind of hits

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.570
a stalling point
in whether it then

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:42.380
finds a home on the other
side where a group of people

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.130
say, yeah, this could
easily be a product.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:44.950
Let's go for it.

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:46.500
It's worth being a product.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.750
It'll either sink or swim.

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:50.430
But I think I've always--
at least in the lab,

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:53.549
you could see a
trajectory of a project

01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:55.090
just stop being
interesting to people

01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.130
because the next steps
were kind of doing it

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:01.040
100 times to get the
quality control levels right

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:01.832
or what not.

01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:04.210
To do a lot of animal
work just wasn't

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.290
that interesting anymore.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:09.591
So that's when we typically
tried to kick it out.

01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:10.090
Yeah.

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:17.760
When the questions become--
I think that curious people

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.050
love unpredictability.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:24.200
And I think that scientists love
unpredictability in the data.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.620
Every experiment
you do, you find

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.250
something you thought
was going to do X

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.500
and it's not going to do that.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.720
I think that's a very hard
way to make a product.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.990
I think that's kind of a
good scientific discovery.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.030
I think at some point
then it becomes a series

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.590
of business unpredictabilities.

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:38.440
Can we raise the money?

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.330
And so I think
when it transitions

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:43.010
from being a science
experiment to being technology

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:45.195
is kind of when you
go from questions

01:03:45.195 --> 01:03:47.321
to answers in my mind.

01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:49.085
I don't know how others--

01:03:49.085 --> 01:03:53.540
AXEL BICHARA: I would answer
it slightly differently

01:03:53.540 --> 01:04:00.600
in that there's so many
potential investors out there.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.167
And I guess my view is more
from a software, hardware tech

01:04:04.167 --> 01:04:05.625
company, not so
much life sciences.

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:13.120
By networking with potential
investors from early on,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.230
you're likely to create
value in what you're doing

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:20.160
and that could be helping
validate technology or not,

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.404
finding competition.

01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.320
It's just interesting.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.306
What's a body language?

01:04:24.306 --> 01:04:25.680
Do you have really
short meetings

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.050
or are there people
leaning forward and wanting

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.864
to spend more time with you?

01:04:31.864 --> 01:04:33.530
Every entrepreneur
needs to build a team

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:34.430
from the beginning.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:38.810
I think value added
investors have great networks

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:43.310
and may give you feedback
on where there at the holes

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:46.127
in your team and maybe
make introductions.

01:04:46.127 --> 01:04:47.585
Some of the best
deals I've done is

01:04:47.585 --> 01:04:49.668
I ended up introducing the
founders to each other.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:53.680
That doesn't happen
to you if you don't

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.860
go out and talk to people.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:59.730
So I would say, if in doubt, I
would start turning financing

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.750
sources earlier.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.880
That doesn't mean
you do a big pitch

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.330
and set up a meeting
at a VC firm.

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.639
That's let's grab a
coffee at a Starbucks

01:05:06.639 --> 01:05:08.430
with somebody who has
some domain knowledge

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.812
and get some feedback.

01:05:09.812 --> 01:05:10.804
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:26.676 --> 01:05:29.300
AMIR NASHAT: What's
the triple one?

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.785
What's the double?

01:05:30.785 --> 01:05:31.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:58.280
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
So this is again

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.295
one of those it depends
kind of answers.

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:06.800
The first thing that I
think you have to recognize

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.940
is that by declaring that
you have multiple objectives,

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.060
you've set yourself
a much harder task.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.090
That doesn't mean
it's not worth doing.

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:19.930
But the point is, from the
get go, you've set yourself

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.200
a very challenging proposition.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.560
And there is a much
smaller segment

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.870
of investors who are interested
in that kind of proposition.

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:35.730
Most of them are not
here on the east coast.

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:40.220
It's not that there aren't
any, but most of them are not.

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.380
You will find
congregations of them

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:48.250
at places like SoCap, the
Social Capital Conference.

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:54.670
You'll find them at
places similar to that.

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.970
There are foundations
that are beginning

01:06:56.970 --> 01:07:03.250
to do some investment because
they may want to see a return,

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.410
but they don't have to.

01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:09.720
So Omidyar for example is one.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.350
Domini is one.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.790
There are several like that.

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:18.520
The Kahn foundation does some.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:26.780
But again, you're
talking about seeking out

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.070
investors who are a very
tiny sliver of an already

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.190
small pool.

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:33.520
So it just makes
it incumbent on you

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.360
to be that much more focused
about really seeking out

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.350
investors who are interested
in your specific proposition.

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:43.910
Not double bottom line or
triple bottom line investors,

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:48.580
but people who have
declared publicly

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:53.040
that they are interested in
whatever it is you're doing.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.940
Because it really is a
very, very narrow segment.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.340
The good news I would
say is that there

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.500
is a lot more happening
in that segment of late.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.630
It's very disorganized.

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.270
Extremely disorganized.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:13.310
And you'll find that there are
even more, on a relative scale,

01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:15.970
there are even more people
looking for that capital

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:20.917
than there are looking for
conventional venture money,

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:21.750
whatever that means.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.660
So it's challenging.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.359
It's not impossible, but
it's really incumbent on you.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.569
You need to be very,
very focused in targeting

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:36.142
exactly the right folks.

01:08:36.142 --> 01:08:37.850
That's the last thing
I'll say about that

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:42.760
is that there are some
really good groups to join

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.040
if you haven't already--
again, to share peer knowledge.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.910
So the social entrepreneurship
groups, for example,

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:55.189
are really, really
worth being involved

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:58.904
in to share intelligence
with peer companies

01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:02.510
so that you can
help each other out.

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:04.420
AMIR NASHAT: If I can
make a comment on it.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.100
Again, I'm going
to color my comment

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.670
by saying that I invest in
biotech and health care stuff

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.149
primarily.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:15.359
I find this whole concept of
double, triple, and quadruple,

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.330
and I'm sure people make
up more bottom lines

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:20.750
to be kind of
intellectually-- like it

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.069
lacks intellectual rigor.

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:26.729
Without question, every
single person I've backed,

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.779
especially in the
health care area,

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:32.319
is not doing what they're
doing to make money.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:35.300
They're doing what they're
doing to make a huge impact.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:39.000
If you want to make an
apology for not making

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.430
a huge impact by
saying, well, I'm

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:43.640
going to do some other stuff.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.770
I've got these
multiple objectives.

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.880
They've got one objective,
which is to cure that disease.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.020
The faster they can cure it
with the least amount of money,

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.150
with the fastest amount of time,
the most efficient way to do it

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.700
is in the benefit
of the patient.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.280
And so what you find
is that if you then

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.800
want to treat the most
number of patients

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.460
with that medicine
or that approach,

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.170
the most efficient
business model

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.320
which creates the greatest
profitability, which

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.850
allows the maximum
amount of sharing

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.660
of value between the
person that gains

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.199
the benefit and the person
who provided the benefit

01:10:18.199 --> 01:10:19.240
is the best way to do it.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.437
And when you look
at even in places

01:10:22.437 --> 01:10:24.270
where social entrepreneurship
is a big deal,

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:27.150
I think when you'll find
ideas that really take off,

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:29.200
it's because there's a
sustainability to them.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.410
The person that
receives the benefit

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.630
is willing to share that
benefit with the person that

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.430
provides it.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.540
And I think this idea that we're
going to skimp on all of that

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.900
and not come up with a
business model that's

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.880
the best alignment of
everyone's interests

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.990
is to me where I kind of
get lost in the whole thing.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:51.320
I feel like usually when you
have these situations where

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.267
you're kind of compromising,
I suppose-- because every time

01:10:54.267 --> 01:10:56.600
someone said double or triple
bottom line, which I'm not

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.030
implying is your
case, it feels to me

01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:01.420
like a compromise versus
saying, let's align

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:05.944
the interests of the farmer in
the village who doesn't have

01:11:05.944 --> 01:11:07.360
enough money for
the weather data,

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.110
but they've got interest
in other things--

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.180
let's find a way to
make it a win-win-win

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.910
and really line up
everybody's interest.

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:16.160
And then it becomes
actually only one objective,

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.390
which is maximum impact for
everybody in the equation.

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:22.025
So I don't like the idea
that it's compromise.

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:25.000
And so maybe it's
colored by health care

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.301
and maybe my tech partners
wouldn't necessarily

01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:28.300
view the world that way.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.420
But in every one of our
health care companies,

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.950
everyone's only got one
objective-- cure that kid

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:35.640
or make that impact.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.740
And the money is just
part of the whole equation

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:40.460
to make it as efficient,
the Carnot efficiency

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:41.780
of the idea basically.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.820
Just get it as perfect
as you can to line it up.

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.819
So that's kind of
the way I do it.

01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:49.110
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN: I think
you should get extra points

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:52.780
for saying Carnot efficiency
in a discussion about finance.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:55.720
This is how we
know we're at MIT.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.119
We're geeks.

01:11:57.119 --> 01:11:58.660
AMIR NASHAT: Everybody
understood it.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.620
No one was not understanding it.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.280
PROFESSOR: It's on a
cheat sheet beforehand.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.567
What about with
all the different--

01:12:07.567 --> 01:12:09.108
AMIR NASHAT: They
don't use that word

01:12:09.108 --> 01:12:10.471
at Harvard, that's for sure.

01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:12.279
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:12.279 --> 01:12:14.070
PROFESSOR: With all
the different financing

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:17.500
sources that are out now
with crowdfunding coming on

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.990
and the traditional friends
and family and everything,

01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:26.090
can you talk a little bit about
mismatch of investor groups?

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.720
Have you seen deals
that were really

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.280
good deals but they got
the wrong initial investors

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.720
and you can't work
with them and you pass?

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.490
What kind of watch
words would you

01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:41.390
have for people about
how they approach that?

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.100
Is that a common mistake?

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.820
Or anyway, just can
you comment on that?

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.465
Anybody?

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:48.910
AXEL BICHARA: I can
start with a few.

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:53.049
The most classic
is-- well, I guess

01:12:53.049 --> 01:12:55.090
the two classic ones that
jump to mind right away

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:59.510
are amount of capital
relative to the opportunity,

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:06.310
where you're going after some
marketable opportunity which

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:09.870
turns out to be kind of narrow,
but you've raised so much money

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:13.220
that you kind of need to
assume a level of success

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.720
that the market
will just not yield.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.000
These are the worst deals.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.250
And the conflict may
not happen immediately,

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.560
but it happens over time.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.740
So being realistic about the
potential of the market you're

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.280
going after and
raising the capital

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.924
to really pursue the upset
over time, but not all upfront

01:13:29.924 --> 01:13:31.590
because you think the
stars will line up

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.810
in terms of what you pursue.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:38.940
Some of the worst deals I've
done had exactly that problem.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.170
The other one--
strategic investors.

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:42.980
Strategic investors,
by definition,

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.230
have a strategic
interests and not

01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:47.740
primarily a financial interest.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.610
And just think about how long
it takes to build a company.

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:55.090
I would say most
overnight successes

01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:56.830
took 10 years to get there.

01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:58.710
So let's say there's
a 10 year time frame

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.690
to build a great company.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.770
During those 10 years,
whoever did the deal

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.210
from the strategic
investor, which

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.920
is often a biz deaf, culp
deaf person, whatever.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.520
You've gone through two
or three board members.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.950
They totally forgot why they
invested in the first time.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:18.420
They're not professional
investors like VCs.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.810
And you inevitably end
with-- not inevitably.

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:26.420
You very, very often
end with situations

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.040
where there's a lawyer for
some strategic investor sitting

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.080
there reading the fine print of
the legal agreement done eight

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.030
years ago looking at
all the rights they have

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:41.626
and really becoming a
nightmare to work with.

01:14:41.626 --> 01:14:44.780
I've been in situations where
the strategic investors,

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.160
you're trying to go
public, strategic investor

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.810
has a board seat.

01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:50.210
I'm not signing off on DS1.

01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:51.880
We don't want this
company to go public.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.460
People actually do that.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.560
Professional investors like
VCs would never ever do that.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.140
So I think having professional
investors on board first

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:05.710
before you take on strategics
is a very good idea,

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:09.390
because professional investors
help you get the terms and also

01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:13.750
relative ownership and all of
that right with strategics.

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.370
And I've just seen
it so many times,

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:19.460
that it may even be
great for a few years.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.550
But over the life of
a typical company,

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:26.072
you very frequently run
into significant issues.

01:15:26.072 --> 01:15:27.530
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
The other thing

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.920
that I've seen happen
again and again

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:37.670
is where there have been large
numbers of early investors,

01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:40.870
whether they're friends and
family or loosely affiliated

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.190
angels or what have
you, and someone

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:50.020
has made the oversight of
making decisions unanimous.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.340
This is a nightmare.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.550
Because what ends up happening
is you might have, who knows,

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:59.190
17 or 20 or God knows how many
individual parties who have

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:03.000
to sign off on every
subsequent thing that happens.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.770
And I've seen this
happen many times.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:07.430
It it's a terrible mistake.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:12.230
It costs an incredible amount
of time to fix that and go back.

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.410
And I've seen
individual investors

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:18.710
who have put $10,000
into a company

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:23.720
just tie up deals for days or
weeks or even scotch deals.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.740
So not just strategic,
not signing an S1,

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:34.230
but individual very, very tiny
investors preventing a deal

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:36.890
from happening.

01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:38.860
So if you do the friends
and family route--

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.190
I would not advise you not to do
that-- just make sure that you

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:43.970
have good counsel.

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:47.080
You don't have the benefit
of a professional investor

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:47.750
to advise you.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:52.620
Make sure you have good counsel
to structure that round so

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:57.110
that you're not bound to
having every single person

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:59.985
participating agree with
every future decision

01:16:59.985 --> 01:17:03.138
you have to make

01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:04.990
AMIR NASHAT: I'm going
to give a squishy--

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:06.540
like an early
biomarker or squishy

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:11.030
answer for how I kind
of have viewed people I

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:12.380
have found difficult work with.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.920
Again, we're kind of in the
same boat most of entrepreneurs

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.710
are in.

01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.442
We invest early.

01:17:16.442 --> 01:17:18.650
We bring other VCs on the
board and we get frustrated

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.280
by our colleagues.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.960
So we're like, pulling out
our hair, too, sometimes.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.290
And so I've always found
that investors that actually

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:30.040
ask a lot of
questions-- and it's

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.840
very specific to
a particular deal.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.730
Someone who's a good listener
asks questions and is just

01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:39.110
listening and
questioning is usually

01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:40.580
probably a better investor.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.430
Whenever I've been in these
kind of nightmare situations,

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.180
you later kind of
remember that, you know,

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:46.930
they didn't really ask
a lot of questions.

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:48.230
They just told me a lot stuff.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:51.380
They kept lecturing me
about my idea, my company.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.110
I think usually that's
like my first alarm bell

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:56.030
whenever we're
involved in stuff.

01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:58.510
And it can go wrong
1,000 different ways.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:01.500
But if they're not asking
you interesting questions

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:05.560
and listening, you're probably
in for a bruising relationship,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.566
in my opinion.

01:18:06.566 --> 01:18:07.940
And the sooner
you get-- and then

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.680
reference checks, whoever
said that earlier-- Axel had

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.570
say reference the
hell out of investors.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.825
We do.

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:19.680
PROFESSOR: We're coming
up close to break time.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.390
Maybe one last
question and then I'll

01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:23.777
ask the panel if you
have any last comments.

01:18:23.777 --> 01:18:25.360
Don't feel you have
to, but if there's

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.010
something that's pressing.

01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:28.412
Was there a question over there?

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:29.328
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.511
Do you know they
are going to have

01:18:45.511 --> 01:18:47.750
to be part of the
gang that's employed,

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.402
would you go talk
to them straightaway

01:18:50.402 --> 01:18:52.250
if they were very [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.970
AMIR NASHAT: I'll give
you a general answer.

01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:11.360
I think you should get
rid of your biggest

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.210
risk with the least amount
of money as fast as possible.

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:19.710
And the way you described the
situation maybe your friend

01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:22.290
has-- it's like, my friend
has a rash, at the doctor--

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.199
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:25.699 --> 01:19:30.160
I guess is basically
like, if there's

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.799
a point at which you are stuck,
then you should get unstuck.

01:19:32.799 --> 01:19:33.840
I'll give you an example.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.610
Sun Catalytics is a
really good example.

01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:38.332
If I'd gone to my
partners-- we were

01:19:38.332 --> 01:19:39.540
developing this energy stuff.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.120
And one of the big
markets was India

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.720
initially for the company.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.784
If I'd gone to my
partners and said,

01:19:45.784 --> 01:19:47.450
hey, we need to put
in a bunch of money.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:48.060
It's going to be great.

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.800
We're going to go commercialize
in India and all this.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.795
Or any other VC people.

01:19:50.795 --> 01:19:51.545
They'd say, India?

01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:53.010
What are you going to do there?

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.230
So very, very early in
the life of the company,

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.200
I realized we needed to have
that fixed, because it's

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.390
a major risk that one
of our largest markets

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:01.302
was one nobody new.

01:20:01.302 --> 01:20:02.510
So we went and we did a deal.

01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:04.480
We got an investment
and partnership dollars

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.820
from the Totten Group.

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.470
I've never heard that
question in four or five

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:10.640
years about the company.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.320
We can say anything about India.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.362
Yeah, we're going to go
sell spaceships in India.

01:20:14.362 --> 01:20:16.111
They're like, oh yeah,
you're with Totten?

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:16.940
No problem.

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.496
And we just basically got
rid of the biggest risk

01:20:19.496 --> 01:20:20.995
which was this
perception that there

01:20:20.995 --> 01:20:23.540
was no market by solving it.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.600
Now could we have gotten
better terms later or whatever?

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.650
Maybe, but I got rid
of it at the earliest

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.560
point in the context of deal.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.772
And so if you're really going
to be stuck with these guys,

01:20:35.772 --> 01:20:37.480
I think you're going
to worry about that,

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.021
that you don't get rid of your
big-- whatever your risks are.

01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:42.580
I always kind of list them and
I say the biggest one first.

01:20:45.562 --> 01:20:47.880
JULIANNE ZIMMERMAN:
I absolutely agree.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.780
The other thing that I think you
want to be really careful about

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:58.240
is if there's honest to God
only one major player you need

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.530
to cooperate with
you and whatever

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:03.020
that means-- first
of all, you want

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.520
to make sure you're not
going down a cul-de-sac.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.672
Not only do you want
to retire the risk,

01:21:07.672 --> 01:21:09.380
but you want to make
sure that you're not

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.320
aiming for something
that's not going to exist

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.310
when you're ready to get there.

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:18.190
So you really want to understand
what's in it for them,

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:23.370
not just now, but when
you're ready in whatever,

01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:25.290
a year or five years.

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:30.166
Are you aiming for a place
where they will no longer be?

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:31.540
Because what you
don't want to do

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:38.430
is spend that next chunk of your
life going into a blind alley.

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.460
And I wasn't here last night.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.575
I miss Bob's talk.

01:21:41.575 --> 01:21:42.654
But I've seen it before.

01:21:42.654 --> 01:21:44.570
And if I remember
correctly, one of the things

01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:46.880
that he likes to say
is, go talk to people

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.200
and don't try to sell them.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.380
Just have a hypothetical
conversation.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:54.810
If I had this, would
that interest you?

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:58.240
I understand your interests
like this, do I have that right?

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.840
Do I understand what
you really want?

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.460
You can have those
conversations without having

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.760
to make big disclosures,
without having to formalize

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.630
any kind of relationship.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:15.950
And just like you want your
investors to ask questions,

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:17.750
you want to be asking
a lot of questions

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:20.440
along the way of
any party you're

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.600
going to be working with.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.530
And if it's really
true that you are

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:27.250
going to be dependent
on this one entity,

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.140
then you really
need to understand

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:34.260
how vital it is to
them that they're

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:38.230
going to get to have access
to whatever you're developing.

01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:42.950
And you need to stay very
close to that vital interest

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:48.870
because even if you sign a deal
with them today, as Axel said,

01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:50.510
people change roles.

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:53.180
They go on and work
for another company.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.340
You lose a champion,
and if you don't already

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.370
have a deeper connection
with that organization,

01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:02.120
you could be talking
to a lawyer, which

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.680
is not a really great feeling.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.650
So yeah, you definitely want
to prioritize your risks.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:08.650
You want to retire them.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:12.630
You also really want to
understand if you're really

01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:15.550
pinning your prospects
on this one company,

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:17.750
you better make sure
that they're going

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:20.205
to be there when you get there.

01:23:20.205 --> 01:23:27.260
AXEL BICHARA: So I would
get the deal done early,

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:31.570
at least get started early,
but get people experienced

01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.970
with deal making on
board, whether it's

01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:37.350
an investor, advisory,
friend of the company.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.750
Some of these big
strategic deals,

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:42.250
they may take more than
a year to get done.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:47.520
And the way to think about them
is really like a chess game.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.300
You need to think
a bunch of moves

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.330
ahead to really
achieve your objective.

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:59.380
And I'm a big believer
in skilled negotiation

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.700
actually creating
value fundamentally

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.190
because you find win-wins,
alignment of interests,

01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:07.130
and you may only
discover that after five

01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:09.710
or six moves in the chess game.

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:16.700
And people who have done that
many times in their lives,

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.504
just from experience, turns out
they can add a lot of value.

01:24:19.504 --> 01:24:20.920
So that maybe
another perspective.

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:26.780
PROFESSOR: Are there
any final words

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:30.650
of wisdom you'd like to impart?

01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:31.524
Well, we'd like to--

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:32.440
AXEL BICHARA: Not met.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.900
PROFESSOR: I think have some
very valuable MIT-- [LAUGHTER]

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.130
no, wait, wait, wait.

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:43.640
These are MIT paper weights.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.610
You can have them
if you promise not

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.842
to throw them at entrepreneurs.

01:24:47.842 --> 01:24:50.050
I leave it to your discretion
of whether you use them

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:52.454
with your investors,
your fellow investors.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.120
And we'd all like to
thank you very much

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.560
and hopefully you'll stay around
for a few minutes for a chat.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.760
So thank you.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.350
In this segment, we go
through a quick review

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.700
of a few properties of
the Bernoulli process

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.420
that we already know.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.410
We start by thinking about the
number of successes or arrivals

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.740
in the first n time slots.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.270
This is the following quantity.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.300
At each time we add a
0 or a 1, depending on

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.650
whether we've had
a success or not,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.150
then by adding those numbers,
we get the total number

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.690
of successes.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.080
Now we already know that the
number of successes in n trials

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.410
obeys a binomial distribution,
so the probability

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.320
of having k successes is given
by the binomial probabilities.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.380
And this is a formula that
holds for k equal to 0 up to n,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.790
which are the possible numbers
for the random variable S.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.740
For this random variable,
we know the expected value.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.500
It's n times p.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.660
And we also know its
variance, which is n times

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.410
p times 1 minus p.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.340
Another random
variable of interest

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.240
is the time until the
first success or arrival.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.430
So this is defined
to be the smallest

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.005
i for which the random
variable Xi is equal to 1.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.900
We have done this
calculation in the past.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.550
The probability that the first
success appears at time k is

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.520
the same as the probability
that the first k minus 1 trials

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.850
resulted in 0's.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.530
And then, the k-th
trial resulted in a 1.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.620
And so the probability
of this is 1 minus p,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.070
the probability of 0, and
we have k minus 1 of them,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.870
times p, the probability
that the next trial gives us

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.080
a success.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.300
And this formula is valid
for k being 1, 2, and so on,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.850
which is the range
of possible values

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.160
of this random variable T1.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.020
This is the familiar
geometric distribution

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.300
that we have dealt with
on several occasions.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.930
And in particular, we know the
expected value and the variance

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.520
of the geometric
random variable.

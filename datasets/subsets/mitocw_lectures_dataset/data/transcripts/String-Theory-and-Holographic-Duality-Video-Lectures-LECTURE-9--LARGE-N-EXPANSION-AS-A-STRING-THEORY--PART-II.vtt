00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.130
HONG LIU: OK, let's start.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.490
So first let me just
remind you what we

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.380
did at the end of last lecture.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.700
So we see that the large N
expansion of gauge theory

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.460
have essentially exactly the
same mathematical structure

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.980
with, say, the mathematics of
the [? N string ?] scattering.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.250
And so here the observable
is a correlation function

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.020
of gauging
[? invariant ?] operators.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.520
And then these have a large
N expansion as follows.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.290
And on this side you have
just an N string scattering

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.930
amplitude.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.800
Just imagine you have some
kind of scattering of strings,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.036
with total number of N strings.

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:13.410
And then this also
have expansion

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.460
in terms of the string
counting in this form.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.330
So now, if we identify--
so if we can identify the g

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.810
string as 1/N. So if we
identify g string with 1/N,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.040
then these two are essentially
the same kind of expansion, OK?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.050
And you also can identify
these external strings,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.230
string states,
within the large N

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.285
theory which we called
the glueball states

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:57.410
for single-trace operators.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.715
And then each case is
corresponding to [? sum ?]

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:08.465
over the topology.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.120
It's an expansion [? in ?]
terms of the topology.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:29.516
So here is the topology
of the worldsheet string.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.390
And here is the topology
of Feynman diagrams.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160
Here is the topology of
the Feynman diagrams.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.690
So still at this
stage, it's just

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.359
like a mathematical
correspondence.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.400
We're looking at two
completely different things.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.940
But probably there's no--
yeah, no obvious connection

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.060
between these two objects
we are discussing.

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:18.740
Yeah, we just have a precise
mathematical structure.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.760
But one can actually argue that,
actually, they also describe

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.025
the same physical structure
once you realize that when

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:35.740
you sum over all possible
Feynman diagrams.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:46.830
So once you realize that
each Feynman diagram, say,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:04:02.880
of genus-h can be
considered as a partition,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.340
or in other words,
triangulization

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.055
over genus-h surfaces,
[? 2D ?] surfaces.

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:19.555
OK.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:35.810
So if you write more
explicitly this fh,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:45.787
so if we write explicitly this
fh, then this fh, this fnh,

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:47.370
then will be
corresponding to your sum

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:58.290
of all Feynman
diagrams of genus-h.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.425
Suppose G is the expression
for each Feynman diagram.

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:17.470
Say for each diagram.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.220
And then I can
just rewrite this.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:46.170
In some sense, I [? accept ?]
all possible triangulation

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.140
of [? a genus-g ?] surface.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:06.355
Say there will be some
weight G. And summing over

00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:12.030
all possible
triangulations of a surface

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.720
is essentially-- so
this is essentially

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:29.180
the same as this sum over
all possible surfaces.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.290
So this is a discrete version.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.150
So sum all possible
triangulations

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.365
of some genus-g
surfaces, or translations

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:58.107
of genus-g surfaces.

00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:00.440
Then they can be considered
as a discrete version of sum

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.112
over all possible surfaces, OK?

00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:06.070
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
it's like a sum over

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.000
[? syntheses, ?] like
a simple [? x? ?]

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
HONG LIU: Exactly.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.350
Exactly.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:21.080
Yeah, because, say, imagine
when you sum over surfaces,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.590
so you sum over all
possible metric.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.330
You can put [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.440
And that's the
same way as you sum

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.270
over different discretizations
of that surface

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.260
once you have defined the
unit for that discretization.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:43.140
So if we can identify--
so for now record this Fh.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:58.060
So this Fh, this Fnh
is the path integral

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:06.584
over all genus-h surfaces
with some string action,

00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:07.875
weighted by some string action.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:35.545
So if we can, say,
identify this G

00:08:35.545 --> 00:08:47.710
with some string action-- the
exponential of some string

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.210
action.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.980
Then we would
have-- then one can

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:08.580
conclude that large N gauge
theory is just a string

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.750
theory, OK?

00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:17.855
That large N gauge theory
is just a string theory,

00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:19.015
if you can do that.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:30.130
In particular, the
large N limits--

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.690
so large N limit here,
as we discussed before,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.590
can considered as a classical
theory of glueballs.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.610
Or a classical theory of
the single-trace operators.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.670
So this would be matched to
the classical string theory.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.610
So as we mentioned last time,
so I was mentioning before,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:07.090
this expression-- so just
as in the as we discussed

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.037
[INAUDIBLE], the
[? expansion ?] in g

00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:14.850
string the same as
expansion in the topology.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.690
And the expansion
in the topology

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.380
can also be considered
as the expansion

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.300
of the groups of a string.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.020
Because whenever you add
a hole to the genus--

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.650
when you add the genus, and you
actually add the string hole,

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.655
you add the string loop diagram.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.550
So in this sense, you can
[? integrate ?] all these

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.300
higher order corrections,
as the quantum

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.337
correction to this
classical string behavior.

00:10:43.337 --> 00:10:45.420
So this is just a tree-level
amplitude for string.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.340
And this [? goes ?]
one into the loops.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.290
Whenever you add this
thing, you add the loop.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.790
OK.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.002
Is this clear?

00:10:52.002 --> 00:10:53.975
Now, remember what we
discussed for the torus.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.940
If you've got a torus,
then correspondingly

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.960
you have a string split
and joined together.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.280
And this split and join
process you can also

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.250
consider as a string loop,
a single string going

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:17.075
around a loop, [? just like ?]
in the particle case, OK?

00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:19.790
In the standard
field theory case.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:28.450
And so the large N limit, which
is the leading order term here,

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.034
would map to a leading order
in the string scattering.

00:11:31.034 --> 00:11:33.450
And the leading order in the
string scattering-- they only

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.860
consider tree-level
[? skin ?] scatterings,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.710
and then corresponding to
classical string theory.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:46.830
And also the
single-trace operator

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:53.685
here can be mapped
to the string states.

00:11:53.685 --> 00:11:55.577
Yeah, can be mapped
to the string states.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:14.780
But this is only-- this
is a very nice picture.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.410
But for many years,
this was just a dream.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:25.840
And because this guy looks
very different from this guy,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.310
but this is
difficult. So this has

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:44.670
some [? identification is ?]
difficult for the following

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.170
reasons.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.680
So first, so this G just--
say your Feynman diagrams,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.380
amplitude for particular
Feynman diagram.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:14.220
So G is typically
expressed as product

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.300
of field theory propagators.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.645
So imagine how you evaluate
the Feynman diagram.

00:13:27.645 --> 00:13:29.020
The Feynman diagram,
essentially,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.540
is just a product of
the [? propagators. ?]

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:38.657
And then you integrate
it [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:39.740
integrated over spacetime.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.200
So they just take the
Yang-Mills theory.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.540
And if you look at the
expression for this diagram,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.920
of course, it looks nothing.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:15.820
So they look nothing like-- OK.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.840
So let me make a few
comments about this thing.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.270
Because if you want to match,
say if I gave you a Yang-Mills

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.712
theory, so I gave you a QCD,
then you can write down-- then

00:14:33.712 --> 00:14:35.920
you can go to large N. You
can write down expressions

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.304
for the common diagrams.

00:14:38.304 --> 00:14:39.720
But if you say, I
want to write it

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.720
as a string theory, the
first thing you have to say,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.710
what string theory do
you want to compare?

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.070
So first you have
to ask yourself

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.350
what string action do
you want to compare.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:06.480
So the string action, as
we discussed last time,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.000
this describes the
embedding of the worldsheet

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.430
into some spacetime.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:21.600
OK, so this is worldsheet
into a spacetime.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.780
So this is also sometimes
called the target space.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.290
So this is a spacetime.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.590
This string moves.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.240
And the mathematical
of this is just the--

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:47.640
this is encoded in this
mapping X mu sigma tau.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.350
OK, X mu is the
coordinate for M.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.925
And then sigma tau
is the coordinate

00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:55.470
as you parameterize
your worldsheet.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.080
So in order to write
down action, of course,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:06.354
you have to choice
of space manifold.

00:16:06.354 --> 00:16:07.770
You have to choose
your spacetime.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.890
And also you have to--
when you fix the spacetime,

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.710
you don't have a choice.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.435
And sometimes the way to write
down such kind of embedding

00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:25.210
is not unique.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.010
The action for such
[? finding ?] is unique,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:35.220
so you only need to choose
what action you include.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.700
And also often, in
addition to this embedding,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:51.560
sometimes you can have
additional internal degrees

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.060
freedom.

00:16:58.505 --> 00:16:59.380
living on worldsheet.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.790
For example, you can
have some fermions.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.449
Say if you have a
superstring, then

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:12.630
you can have some
additional fermions

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:17.389
are living on the worldsheet,
in addition to this embedding.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.100
So in other words, the choice
of this guy in some sense

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.410
is infinite.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.845
And without any
clue-- so you need

00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:39.230
some clue to know what to
compare the gauge theory to.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.740
And otherwise,
even if this works,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.590
you're searching for some
needle in the big ocean.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.250
And then there's another
very important reason

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:09.605
why this is difficult, is
that this string theory

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:11.140
is formulated in a continuum.

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:21.095
It's formulated in a continuum.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:32.800
And these Feynman
diagrams, even if they're

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.160
corresponding to some
kind of string theory,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.260
they correspond into a
discrete version of that.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.875
So at best, it's a
discrete version.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:19:11.810
So we expect such a
geometric picture for G,

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:20.840
for these Feynman
diagrams, to emerge only

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.990
at strong couplings.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.545
OK?

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.920
Emerge only at strong couplings
for the following reason.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.520
So if you look at
the Feynman diagram--

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.505
so the simplest Feynman
diagram we draw before,

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:46.585
say for example
just this diagram.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.420
And if you draw
it on the sphere,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:58.380
it separated the sphere
into three parts, OK?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.140
So this [? discretizes ?]
a sphere into three parts.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.210
And essentially, just as
the sphere just becomes

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.126
three points, because
each particle is wanting

00:20:06.126 --> 00:20:09.290
to-- when you're trying
to [INAUDIBLE] each part,

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.130
you approximate it by one point.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.410
So essentially, in
this diagram, you

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.220
approximate the whole sphere
essentially by three points.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:17.720
OK.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.510
And of course, it's hard to
see your [? magic ?] picture

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.980
from here.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.212
And your [? magic picture ?]
you expect to emerge,

00:20:27.212 --> 00:20:30.350
but your Feynman diagrams
become very complicated.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.096
For example, if you have
this kind of diagram,

00:20:34.096 --> 00:20:35.470
because of the
four-point vertex.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.445
In principle, you can
have all these diagrams.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.070
And then this
[INAUDIBLE] [? wanting ?]

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.790
to discretize-- yes, I
suppose this is on the torus.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.580
Suppose you have
a-- for example,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.074
this could be a Feynman
diagram on the torus, OK?

00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:51.240
For the vacuum [? energy. ?]

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.150
And now this is next some
kind of proper discretization.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.610
And this will go to
a continuum limit,

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.587
say when the number of
these box go to infinity.

00:21:04.587 --> 00:21:06.170
When the number of
box go to infinity,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.390
then you need a
number of propagators,

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.770
and the number of vertices
goes to infinity, OK?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.560
So in order for
continuum, a picture

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.920
to emerge, so you
want those complicated

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.960
diagrams-- it's not your number
of vertices or large number

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.012
of propagators that dominate.

00:21:24.012 --> 00:21:25.470
And for those things
that dominate,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.240
then you need the
strong coupling.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.030
Because with this coupling, this
is the leading order diagram.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.750
And there's no
geometry from here, OK?

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.150
So in order to
have the geometry,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.130
you want the diagram are
very, very complicated,

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.470
so that they
really-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.510
a triangulation of a surface.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.670
A weak coupled diagram with
small number of lines will

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:54.940
cause [? one ?] [? and two ?]
are very close triangulization

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.970
of a surface.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.050
So we expect this only appears
in strong couplings, OK?

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.690
Yeah.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.340
AUDIENCE: By the cases like
we have to sum over all the

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.200
HONG LIU: Yeah, sum over
the [INAUDIBLE] diagram.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.220
AUDIENCE: Including
those simple ones.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.803
HONG LIU: Including
those simple ones.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:20.620
So that's why you
want to-- so if you're

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:28.390
in a weak coupling,
then the simple ones--

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.615
so we sum all those diagrams.

00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:31.698
And each diagram you can
associate with a coupling

00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:32.970
power.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.120
So at weak coupling, then
the lowest order term

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.690
would just dominate.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.670
And the lowest order term
have a very simple diagrams.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.794
And then that's because
[? one ?] and [? two ?] are

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:46.050
very crude triangulization
over the surface.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.150
But if you have a strong
coupling-- in particular,

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.650
if you have an infinite
coupling-- the diagrams,

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.914
the infinite number of
vertices will dominate.

00:22:55.914 --> 00:22:58.080
And then that's because
[? one ?] and [? two ?] have

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.110
very fine triangulization
over the surface.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.334
And then that can go
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:02.334 --> 00:23:05.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
interaction a coupling constant

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:08.529
has been [? dragging ?]
out from--

00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:09.070
HONG LIU: No.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.397
That's just N dragged out.

00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:11.230
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.355
HONG LIU: No, there's what
we call this [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:13.355 --> 00:23:14.950
still remaining.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.860
By coupling, it's only [? N. ?]

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.639
HONG LIU: No, no, this isn't
to [? hold ?] coupling.

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:24.180
In coupling we mean
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.555
So example we talk about,
[? because one ?] [? and two ?]

00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:27.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.870
Yeah, and then we
make more precise.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.820
So in the [? toy ?] example
we talked about before.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.870
So previously we talked
about this example,

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:44.410
N divided by lambda, trace,
say 1/2 partial phi squared,

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:49.210
plus 1/4 phi to the power 4.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.300
And strong coupling
means the lambda large.

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:58.360
Because of the N I've
already factored out,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.890
so you're coupling just lambda.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.255
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.740
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:11.108
AUDIENCE: So in
these [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:11.108 --> 00:24:14.524
the propagator in that
version would become

00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:16.964
the spacetime integration?

00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:17.940
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.892
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering how

00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:23.308
the propagator can
[? agree, ?] can match

00:24:23.308 --> 00:24:24.780
to the spacetime [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.654
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.660
So the propogator--
yeah, propagator you

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.760
do in the standard way.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.230
You just write down
your propagator,

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.350
and then you try
to repackage that.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.210
As the question, you
said, whatever your rule,

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.592
Feynman rule is we just
do that Feynman rule.

00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:48.050
And you write down
this expression.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.970
It's something very complicated.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.390
And then you say, can I find
some geometric interpretation

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.120
of that?

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.230
Yeah, what I'm saying is that
doing from this perspective

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:05.140
is very hard because you don't
know what thing to compare.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.620
And further, in the
second, you expect

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.540
that your [INAUDIBLE]
would emerge only

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.810
in those very
complicated diagrams.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.040
And those complicated diagrams
we don't know how to deal with.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.315
Because they only emerge in
the strong coupling limit,

00:25:20.315 --> 00:25:21.690
but in the strong
coupling limit,

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.430
we don't know how
to deal with that.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.720
And so that's why
it's also difficult.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.605
But [? nevertheless, ?] for
some very simple theories, say,

00:25:32.605 --> 00:25:34.720
if you don't consider
the Yang-Mills theory,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.220
you don't consider
the gauge theory.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.180
But suppose you do consider
some matrix integrals.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:55.705
Say, for very simple systems,
like a matrix integral.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.170
So this structure emphasizes--
this structure only

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:10.130
have to do with you
have a matrices, OK?

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.730
And then you can have
matrix-valued fields [? or ?]

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.960
this structure will emerge.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.191
Or you only have
a matrix integral.

00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:20.440
So there no field at all,
just have a matrix integral.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.070
That same structure
will also emerge.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.970
For example.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:29.950
I can consider theory--
have a theory like this.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.210
Something like this.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.620
And have a theory like this, OK?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.210
And M is just some
[INAUDIBLE] matrices.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.012
So this is just integral.

00:26:52.012 --> 00:26:53.720
And the same structure
will emerge, also,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.270
in this series when we
do large N expansion.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.740
So that structure have nothing
to do-- yeah, you can do it.

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:07.730
So matrix integral is much
simpler than [INAUDIBLE] field

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.980
theory because you have
much less degrees freedom.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.960
So for simple systems like, say,
your matrix integral or matrix

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:24.540
quantum mechanics,
actually, you can

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.630
guess the corresponding
string theory.

00:27:36.999 --> 00:27:38.790
Because also the string
theory in that case

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.710
is also very simple.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.160
You can guess where is
simple string theory.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.460
But it's not possible
for field theory.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.961
It's not possible
for field theory.

00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:49.460
Yes.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.005
AUDIENCE: So what do you mean
by matrix quantum mechanics?

00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.400
Like that, OK.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.670
HONG LIU: So this is
a matrix integral.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.880
And I can make it a little
bit more complicated.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.839
So I make this M to
depend on t, and then this

00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:05.255
become a matrix
quantum mechanics.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:15.767
Say trace M dot squared
plus M squared plus M4.

00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:17.600
Then this become a
matrix quantum mechanics,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.510
because it only have time.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.740
And then I can make
it more complicated.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.310
I can make M be t, x.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.130
Then this becomes one plus
one dimension of field theory.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.020
AUDIENCE: So in what context is
this matrix quantum mechanics

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.540
[? conflicted? ?]

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.550
HONG LIU: Just at
some [? toy ?] model.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:41.570
I just say, and this is a
very difficult question.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.690
You said, I don't know how
to deal with field theories.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.780
Then this [? part of it's ?]
a simple system.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.970
And then just try to
use this philosophy,

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.450
can see whether it can
do it for simple system.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.510
And then you can show that
this philosophy actually

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.350
works if you do a matrix
integral or matrix quantum

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.980
mechanics.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.840
Simple enough, matrix integral
and matrix quantum mechanics.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.110
OK.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.860
And if you want
references, I can give you

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.180
references regarding these.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.230
There's a huge, huge
amount of works, thousands

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:19.400
of papers, written on this
subject in the late '80s

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.110
and early '90s.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.050
So those [? toy ?] examples
just to show actually

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.100
this philosophy works.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.110
I just showed this
philosophy works, OK?

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.050
But it's not possible if we
want to go to higher dimensions.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.320
Actually, there's one paper--
let me just write it here.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.200
So this one paper
explains the philosophy.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.890
So here I did not
gave you many details,

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.000
say, how you write this G
down, how you in principle

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.310
can match with this thing.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.045
With [? another ?]
maybe [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:00.045 --> 00:30:04.590
you can make this discussion
a little bit more explicit,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.040
but I don't have time.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.610
But if you want, you can
take a look at this paper.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:15.145
So this paper discusses the
story for the matrix quantum

00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:15.645
mechanics.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.252
But in the section 2
of this paper-- so this

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.210
is a paper by Klebanov.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.360
So in the section
2 of this paper,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.240
it explains this mapping
of Feynman diagrams

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.420
to the string action.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.020
And this discretization
picture give you

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.080
a nice summary of that
philosophy with more details

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.800
than I have given to you.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.760
So you can take a look at that.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.430
And this paper also has
some other references

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.200
if you want to
take a look at it.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.700
OK.

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:02.650
Any questions?

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.561
Yes.

00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:10.602
AUDIENCE: Sorry, but who
was the first to realize

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.102
this connection
between the surfaces

00:31:12.102 --> 00:31:13.494
in topology of Feynman diagrams?

00:31:13.494 --> 00:31:14.458
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:16.208
AUDIENCE: Who first
realized this relation

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.350
between topology and--

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.840
HONG LIU: So of
course, already when

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.040
't Hooft invented this
large N expansion,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.920
he already noticed that this
is similar to string theory.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.640
So he already commented on that.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.000
And he already
commented on that.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.960
And for many years people
did not make progress.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.650
For many years, people
did not make progress.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.770
But in the late '80s--
in the mid to late '80s,

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:52.740
people started thinking
about the question

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.290
from this perspective,
not from that perspective.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.970
So they started to
think about the order

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:00.890
from this perspective.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:06.050
Because just typical string
theory are hard to solve,

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:06.800
et cetera.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.630
So people think,
maybe we can actually

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.980
understand or generalize our
understanding of string theory

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.625
by discretize the worldsheets.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.515
And then they just
integrate over

00:32:20.515 --> 00:32:22.960
all possible
triangulization, et cetera.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.030
And then they realized
that that thing actually

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.180
is like something
over Feynman diagrams.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.770
And then for the very
simple situations,

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:34.810
say like if you have only
a matrix integral, actually

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.330
you can make the
connection explicit.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.230
So that was in the late '80s.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.210
So people like [? McDowell ?]
or [? Kazakov ?] et cetera that

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.150
were trying to explore that.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.374
Other questions?

00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:57.162
AUDIENCE: I'm having
trouble seeing

00:32:57.162 --> 00:33:01.918
how the sum over all
triangulations [INAUDIBLE] each

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:02.844
surfaces.

00:33:02.844 --> 00:33:05.962
How does that correspond to
the discrete version of summing

00:33:05.962 --> 00:33:06.940
over all [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.310
HONG LIU: Right.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.250
AUDIENCE: That's the discrete
sum over all possible

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.580
[? genus-h, ?] right?

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.850
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.100
I think this is the example.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.780
Yeah, let's consider torus.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:24.200
So a torus is a box with
this identified with this,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.890
and this identified with that.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.930
OK.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.420
And let me first just draw
the simplest partition here.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.390
Just draw like that.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:36.650
Yeah.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.300
Let me just look at
these two things.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:54.700
So suppose I give each box--
so if I specify each box,

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.620
say, give a unit area.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.870
OK?

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.190
And I do this one,
I do that one,

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:07.190
or I do some other
ways to triangulize it.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.429
Then because [? one and two ?]
give a different symmetric

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.844
to the surface.

00:34:11.844 --> 00:34:13.260
And then because
[? one and two ?]

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.029
integrate over all possible
metric on this surface.

00:34:16.029 --> 00:34:17.820
And they integrate over
all possible metric

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.489
on this surface, you can
integrate [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:20.460
all possible surfaces.

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:24.560
AUDIENCE: In the case of
the strings for example,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.920
[? we put some ?]
over the torus here

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.982
and the torus and
the torus there.

00:34:28.982 --> 00:34:29.690
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.909
You only sum over
a single torus.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.616
Now, what do you mean by summing
over torus here, torus there?

00:34:34.616 --> 00:34:36.532
AUDIENCE: I thought like
in the path integral,

00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:39.376
in the case of the
string theory--

00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:42.087
HONG LIU: No, you're only
summing over a single torus.

00:34:42.087 --> 00:34:44.060
You're only summing
over a single surface,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.570
but all possible ways to
write-- all possible ways

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.550
to draw that surface.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.030
So what you said about
summing torus here,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.510
summing torus there, because
[INAUDIBLE] what we call

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.840
the disconnected amplitudes.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.100
And then you don't need to
consider them in physically

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100
disconnected amplitude.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.760
You can just
[? exponentiate ?] what

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.770
we call by connected amplitude.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.580
And you don't need to
do that separately.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.640
So once you know how
to do a single one,

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.051
and the disconnected one
just automatically obtained

00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:17.050
by [? exponentiation. ?]

00:35:20.006 --> 00:35:20.881
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:31.074 --> 00:35:31.740
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.790
No, no.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:38.575
Here the metric matters,
the geometry matters.

00:35:38.575 --> 00:35:41.465
It's not just the topology.

00:35:41.465 --> 00:35:49.445
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Feynman diagram [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:49.445 --> 00:35:50.070
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.403
Yeah, just the key is that
the propagator of the Feynman

00:35:52.403 --> 00:35:54.775
diagram essentially
[? encodes ?] the geometries.

00:35:54.775 --> 00:36:00.710
And in encoding a
very indirect way.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:01.210
Yeah.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.770
Just read this part.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.240
This section only
have a few pages,

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.350
but contain a little bit more
details on what I have here.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:13.800
It requires maybe one more hour
to explain this in more detail.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.070
Yeah, this is just that.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.695
I just want to explain
this philosophy.

00:36:16.695 --> 00:36:19.380
I don't want to go through the
details of how you do this.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.525
OK, good.

00:36:23.525 --> 00:36:25.816
So now let me just mention
a couple of generalizations.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.220
So the first thing
you already asked

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.870
before, I think maybe
both you have asked.

00:36:48.692 --> 00:36:50.066
Let me just mention
them quickly.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:57.830
And if you are interested,
I can certainly

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:02.400
give you a reference for
you to read about them,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.070
or I can put it in
[? your P ?] sets.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:17.100
And so, so far, it's all
matrix-valued fields, OK?

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.350
But if you can see the
theory-- or in other words,

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.314
in the mathematical
language, say,

00:37:22.314 --> 00:37:23.605
it's an adjoint representation.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.030
It's an adjoint
representation of the--

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.261
because our symmetries are
UN, it's a UN gauge group.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.360
OK?

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.490
UN gauge group.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:47.745
But you can also, for example,
in QCD, you also have quarks.

00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:51.850
So you also have field in the
fundamental representations.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:59.220
So it can also include field in
the fundamental representation.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.762
So rather than matrix-valued,
they're N vector.

00:38:03.762 --> 00:38:07.160
OK, they're N [? vectors. ?]

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.950
So for quarks, of course, for
the standard QCD N will be 3,

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.380
so you have three quarks.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.265
You have three different
colored quarks.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.570
And so then your
Feynman diagrams,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.850
in addition to have
those matrix [? lines, ?]

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.080
which you have a double line.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.790
And now here you only
have a single index, OK?

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.606
And then you only
have a single line.

00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:35.980
So the propagator
of those quarks

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.440
will just have a single line.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.981
And then also in
your Feynman diagram

00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:41.790
you can have loops over
the quarks, et cetera.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.266
So you can again work this out.

00:38:43.266 --> 00:38:45.515
And then you find it is a
very nice large N expansion.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:39:02.260
And then you find the
diagrams, the Feynman diagrams.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.310
Now you find in this
case the Feynman

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:25.345
diagrams can be classified by
2D surfaces with boundaries.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:38.400
So essentially, you have-- and
let me just say, for example,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.690
this is the vacuum diagrams,
for all the vacuum process.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.660
Then you can [INAUDIBLE]
or the vacuum diagrams.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.460
And then they can all
be [? collectified. ?]

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.150
So previously, we have
a matrix-valued field.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.445
Then all your vacuum
diagrams, they

00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:07.550
are corresponding closed
surfaces-- so sphere,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.130
torus, et cetera.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.900
But now if you
include the quarks,

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.310
then those surfaces
can have boundaries.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.170
And then [INAUDIBLE] into
the quark groups, et cetera.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:21.270
And then they [? cannot ?]
be classified.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:26.250
And so these also
have a counterpart

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.970
if you try to map to
the string theory.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.345
So this [INAUDIBLE]
[? one and ?] [? two, ?] string

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:31.845
theory.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:47.280
There's string theory with
both closed and open strings.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.610
And so essentially
those boundaries

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.360
give rise to the open strings.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.820
So here, it's all
closed strings.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.820
It's all closed surface.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.670
Well, now you can, by
adding the open strings,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:10.840
and then you can, again,
have the correspondence

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.900
between the two.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.250
OK.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.420
So all the discussion
is very similar to what

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.330
we discussed before.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.720
We just apply all this the
same philosophy to the quarks.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.690
Yes.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] do the
same trick on string theory

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.480
and find some sort
of expression which

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.360
then will map to some higher
order surfaces, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.553
HONG LIU: Sorry, say that again?

00:41:38.553 --> 00:41:41.511
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Feynman diagrams

00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:44.469
we move to string
theory for surfaces.

00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:48.070
Is there some [INAUDIBLE]
from surfaces just they go

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.670
one more [? step up? ?]

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:53.460
HONG LIU: You mean higher
dimensions, not strings.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.260
Yeah, that will
become-- of course,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.885
that's a [? lateral ?] idea.

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.510
So that will [INAUDIBLE] you can
consider [? rather ?] strings,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.320
you can consider
two-dimensional surface,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.610
a two-dimensional surface
moving in spacetime.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.650
And then [INAUDIBLE] into
[? so-called ?] the membrane

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.000
theory.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.850
But let's say where it
turns out to be-- turns out

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.380
string is a nice balance.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.880
It's not too complicated
or not too simple.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.340
And it give you
lots of structure.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.131
But when you go to
membrane, then the story

00:42:26.131 --> 00:42:28.060
become too complicated,
and nobody knows

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.621
how to quantize that theory.

00:42:50.615 --> 00:42:58.590
So the second remark is
that here we consider UN.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.640
So here our symmetry
group is UN.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:11.450
Because our phi-- phi there is
[? commission. ?] So when you

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.070
have a [? commission ?] matrix,
then there's a difference

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:20.820
between the two indices, so
we put one up and one down.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.370
So they are
propagators that lead

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:38.580
to-- so it leads to
the lines with arrows,

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.550
because we need to distinguish
upper and lower indices.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.180
OK?

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.810
Between the two indices.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:52.040
But you can also
consider, for example,

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.870
phi is a symmetric matrix.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.780
Say it's a real
symmetric matrix.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:04.490
It's a real symmetric,
or real anti-symmetric.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:15.260
In those cases, then
there's no difference

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.050
between the two indices.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:25.820
And then when you draw a
propagator-- so in this case

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:34.320
the symmetry group
would be, say,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.500
SON, say, or SPN, et cetera.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:48.980
And then the propagators,
they will no longer

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.680
have orientations.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.180
OK?

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.900
They will no longer
have orientations.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.990
Because you can
no longer-- yeah.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.675
So this will give rise--
so let me write it closer.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:13.810
So this will give rise
to unorientable surfaces.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.166
Say, for example, to
classify the diagrams,

00:45:22.166 --> 00:45:24.290
you can no longer just use
the orientable surfaces.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.620
You also have to include
the non-orientable surfaces

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.470
to classify the diagrams.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:35.520
And the [INAUDIBLE] this also
have a precise counterpart

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.100
into unorientable strings.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.660
No, non-orientable strings.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:56.220
Yeah, I think non-orientable,
non-orientable surfaces.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.410
Also non-orientable strings.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.620
Good.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.780
So I'm emphasizing
how difficult it

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:29.430
is if, say, we want
to start with QCD

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:35.640
and then try to find the
string theory description.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:41.470
But this still, [? none of ?]
this tries-- I just try.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:47:14.660
OK, so let's just consider,
just take large N generalization

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.450
of QCD.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.340
So this, again, will be
some UN gauge theory,

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:26.611
UN Yang-Mills theory, say, in
3 plus 1 dimensional Minkowski

00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:27.110
spacetime.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:41.770
And can we say anything about
its string theory description?

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.380
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.430
So maybe it's difficult,
but let's try to guess it.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.340
OK.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.280
So in physics, in
many situations,

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.990
a seemingly difficult problem,
if you know how to guess it,

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.800
actually you can get the answer.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.140
On, for example,
quantum hole effects,

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.220
fractional quantum hole
effects, you can just

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.490
guess the wave function.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.840
So of course, the
simplest guess--

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.140
so this is some gauge theory in
3 plus 1 dimensional Minkowski

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.800
spacetime.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.800
So now we say this
is a string theory.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:43.450
So natural guess
is that this maybe

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:51.160
is a string theory,
again, in the 3 plus 1

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.890
dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.840
OK?

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.360
So we just take what--
so these will, of course,

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:09.860
run into a string, propagating
in this spacetime, OK?

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.590
As I said, when you write
down the string theory,

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:16.450
you first have to specify
your target space, which,

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:20.680
as the string moves, the
larger question would be just,

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.240
should it be the gauge
theory's Minkowski spacetime.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.930
Maybe this string
theory should be.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.720
OK?

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.160
And then this.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:36.110
Then you can just try
to-- then you can just

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.546
write down the simplest action.

00:49:38.546 --> 00:49:48.780
So maybe say Nambu-Goto action,
which we wrote last time, OK?

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:55.550
Or the [? old ?]
Polyakov action.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:50:03.510
So this Nambu-Goto action will
result [INAUDIBLE] Polyakov.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.200
And let me not worry about that.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.510
For example, you can
just guess, say, maybe

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.360
this is a string theory also
in the Minkowski spacetime.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.440
Say, consider the
simplest action.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.666
Or the equivalent of this, OK?

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.720
Then at least what
you could try-- now

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:47.554
you actually have an action.

00:50:47.554 --> 00:50:49.220
Now you think that
you have this object.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.160
Now you think you can compare.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.890
OK, now you can
essentially compare.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:56.110
Say, in QCD you calculated
your Feynman diagrams,

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.215
and now just compare.

00:50:58.215 --> 00:51:00.090
But of course, you still
have the difficulty.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.923
Of course, you have to
go to strong coupling

00:51:01.923 --> 00:51:04.090
to see the geometric
limit, et cetera.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:07.950
But in principle, it's
something you can do.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.490
But this actually does not work.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.140
OK?

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.280
This does not work, for the
following simple reason.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:30.430
Firstly, that such
a string theory--

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.930
so a string theory, actually
the remarkable thing

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.050
about the string is that
if you have a particle,

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:40.800
you can put the particle
in any spacetime.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.360
But strings are very picky.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.280
You cannot put them
in any spacetime.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.145
And they can only
propagate consistently,

00:51:50.145 --> 00:51:54.220
quantum mechanically
consistently, in some spacetime

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.160
but not in others.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.055
So for example, if you
want to put the string

00:52:00.055 --> 00:52:02.180
to propagate in this 3 plus
1 dimensional Minkowski

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.929
spacetime, then you actually
find that the theory

00:52:06.929 --> 00:52:08.220
is mathematically inconsistent.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:16.050
So such a string
theory is inconsistent.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.200
It's mathematically
inconsistent.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:31.640
Except for the D
equal to 26 or 10.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.490
OK?

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:37.410
So 26 if you just purely
have the theory, and 10

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.690
if you also add some fermion.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.610
So such a string theory does
not exist mathematically.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.990
So you say, oh, OK.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:55.240
You say, I'm a smart fellow.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.904
I can go around this.

00:52:57.904 --> 00:52:59.570
Because we want the
Minkowski spacetime.

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.740
Because those gauge theory
propagating the Minkowski

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:06.200
spacetime, so this Minkowski
[INAUDIBLE] must be somewhere.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.860
They cannot go away, because
all these glueballs [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.450
in this 3 plus 1 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.950
And if we want to identify the
strings with those glueballs,

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:17.741
those strings must at
least [? know ?] some

00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:20.780
of this Minkowski spacetime.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.970
And then you say, oh,
suppose you tell me

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.530
that this string theory is only
consistent in 10 dimension.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:39.880
But then let me take a string
theory in 10 dimensions, which

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.180
itself consistent.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.970
But I take this 10-dimensional
spacetime to have

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.120
the form of a 3
plus 1 dimensional

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.550
Minkowski spacetime.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.880
And the [? time, ?] some
compact manifold, OK?

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.290
Some compact manifold.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.510
And in such case-- so if
this is a compact manifold,

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.760
then the symmetry
of this spacetime,

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.430
so the spacetime
symmetry still only have

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.890
the 3 plus 1 dimensional,
[? say, ?] Poincare symmetry.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:19.010
Because if you want to describe
the QCD in 3 plus 1 dimension,

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.180
QCD has the Poincare symmetry.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.910
You can do Lorentz
transformation,

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:24.450
and then you can do rotation.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.010
Or you can do translation.

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.110
The string theory should not
have more symmetries or less

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:31.110
symmetries than QCD.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.609
They should have
the same symmetries

00:54:32.609 --> 00:54:35.260
because they are supposed
to be the same description.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.360
But if you take the
10-dimensional Minkowski space,

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.530
of course, it's not right.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.030
Because the
10-dimensional Minkowski

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.930
space have 10-dimensional
translation

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:47.450
and 10-dimensional
Lorentz symmetry.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:52.030
But what you can do is that you
take this 10-dimensional space

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.660
to be a form of the 3 plus
1 dimensional Minkowski

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.590
spacetime and times some
additional compact manifold,

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:02.890
and then you have solved
the symmetry problem.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:06.510
But except this
still does not work

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:13.950
because the string theory, as
we know, always contain gravity.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.820
And if you put a string theory
on such a compact space N,

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.195
[? there would be ?]
always leads

00:55:20.195 --> 00:55:26.800
to a massless spin-2 particle in
this 3 plus 1 dimensional part.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.090
But from Weinberg-Witten theorem
we talked in the first lecture,

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:34.090
in the QCD you are
not supposed to have

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:39.450
a 3 plus 1 dimensional
massless spin-2 particle, OK?

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.570
And so this won't work.

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.012
So this won't work.

00:55:44.012 --> 00:55:46.610
Because this contains--

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.260
In 3 plus 1 dimensional
[? Minkowski space, ?]

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:28.840
which does not have-- OK?

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.890
Or in the large N [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:35.200
So this does not work.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.220
So what to do?

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:36.820
Yes?

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.740
AUDIENCE: So does this just
mean that it's mathematically

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.820
inconsistent?

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:41.705
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:56:41.705 --> 00:56:43.913
This does not mean it is
mathematically inconsistent.

00:56:43.913 --> 00:56:47.300
It just means this string
theory cannot not correspond

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.590
to the string theory
[? describe ?] QCD.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:55.530
The string theory description--
the equivalent string theory

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.150
for QCD cannot
have this feature.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.720
Yeah, just say this cannot
be the right answer for that

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.760
string theory.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.850
This string theory
is consistent.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.391
Yes.

00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:05.890
AUDIENCE: So is
that you were saying

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:08.882
if there is a massless spin-2
particle in that string theory,

00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:10.840
there has to be a
[? counterpart in the ?] QCD.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.798
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:57:11.798 --> 00:57:15.155
AUDIENCE: If there is not a
[INAUDIBLE], that won't work

00:57:15.155 --> 00:57:15.780
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.910
This cannot be a
description of that.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:21.250
From Weinberg-Witten theorem,
we know in QCD there's

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.650
no massless spin-2 particle.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.940
Yes.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:30.487
AUDIENCE: I thought we have
talked about maybe we can do

00:57:30.487 --> 00:57:35.260
strings to [? find ?] QCD in
a different dimension [? in ?]

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:35.760
space.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.145
HONG LIU: We will go into that.

00:57:37.145 --> 00:57:38.770
But now they are in
the same dimension,

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:43.070
because this
Minkowski 4, this will

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:50.370
have-- because this is a compact
[? part, ?] it doesn't matter.

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:57.260
So in this part, [? there are ?]
massless spin-2 particles.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.782
This does not
[? apply ?] in QCD.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.980
So what can you do?

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.650
So most people just give up.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.360
Most people give up.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:15.900
So other than give up,
the option is say maybe

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.580
this action is too simple.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.600
Maybe you have to look
at more exotic action.

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.270
OK.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.790
So this is one possibility.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.900
And the second possibility
is that maybe you

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.610
need to look for some
other target space.

00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:41.530
OK.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.950
But now, what if you
go away from here?

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.250
Once you go away from
here, everything else

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:57.649
is now becoming such
little in the ocean,

00:58:57.649 --> 00:58:59.690
because then you don't
have much clue what to do.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:04.330
We just say, your basic
guess just could not work.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:07.689
So for many years, even though
this is a very intriguing idea,

00:59:07.689 --> 00:59:08.980
people could not make progress.

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.207
But now we have hindsight.

00:59:18.207 --> 00:59:19.290
But now we have hindsight.

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:30.460
So we know that even this
maybe cannot be described

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:39.250
by a four-dimensional-- so
even though this cannot have

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:47.820
a-- so this cannot have a
massless spin-2 particle

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.650
in this 3 plus 1 dimension
of Minkowski spacetime.

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:55.330
Maybe you can still have
some kind of graviton

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:57.330
in some kind of a
five-dimensional spacetime.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.095
You have some five dimensions,
in a different dimension.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.940
So there were some rough hints.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:16.156
Maybe you can consider there's a
five-dimensional string theory.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.195
So let me emphasize when
we say five or four,

01:00:27.195 --> 01:00:32.710
I always mention the
non-compact part.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:37.300
So the compact part, it doesn't
count because compact part just

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.640
goes for the ride.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.720
What determines the
properties, say,

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.300
of a massless
particle, et cetera,

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.319
is the uncompact
of the spacetime.

01:00:47.319 --> 01:00:49.360
Yeah, because this is a
10-dimensional spacetime.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.693
This is already not [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:50.693 --> 01:01:01.890
So maybe we [? change ?]
for string theory

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:05.300
in five-dimensional uncompact.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.180
AUDIENCE: Five, so in 4 plus 1?

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.470
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:13.010
In 4 plus 1 uncompact spacetime.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.376
Yes.

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:32.657
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
compactors.

01:01:32.657 --> 01:01:34.031
When you say
compact, do you mean

01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:35.490
the mathematical
definition of compactness?

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:36.698
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

01:01:36.698 --> 01:01:40.050
Yeah, I just say there
is a finite volume.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:42.610
Just for our purpose
here, we can do it simply.

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:48.500
Just let's imagine--
yeah, compact always

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.000
has a finite
volume, for example.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:51.767
Yes?

01:01:51.767 --> 01:01:54.509
AUDIENCE: Why can we just
ignore the compact dimensions?

01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:57.073
Is there any condition on
how big they're allowed

01:01:57.073 --> 01:02:00.620
to be or something, like limit?

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.270
HONG LIU: Yeah, just
when you have-- so

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.140
if you know a little
bit about this thing

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.050
called the Kaluza-Klein theory.

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:16.820
And you know that the
compact part-- the thing

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.640
is that if you have
a theory [? based ?]

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.880
on uncompact and
the compact part,

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.630
and then most of the
physical properties

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.800
is controlled by the
physics of uncompact parts.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.680
And this will
determine some details

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.280
like the detailed
spectrum, et cetera.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.980
But the kind of
thing we worry about,

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.460
whether you have this massless
spin-2 particle, et cetera,

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.387
will not be determined
by this kind of thing.

01:02:36.387 --> 01:02:38.004
AUDIENCE: Is there
any volume limit

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.535
on the compact
part, like maximum?

01:02:39.535 --> 01:02:41.535
HONG LIU: No, it's fine
to have a finite volume.

01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:44.897
AUDIENCE: Just finite,
but can it be large?

01:02:44.897 --> 01:02:46.980
HONG LIU: No matter how
large, this have infinite.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.604
It's always much
smaller than this one.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.390
Yeah, but now it's
just always relative.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:55.650
It's always relative.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:56.160
Yes.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.535
AUDIENCE: Tracking
back a little,

01:02:57.535 --> 01:03:00.740
is there any quick explanation
for 26 and 10 are special,

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.010
or is it very complicated?

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.931
HONG LIU: Um.

01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:07.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.609
No, it's not complicated.

01:03:09.609 --> 01:03:11.650
Actually, we were going
to do it in next lecture.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.730
Yeah, next lecture we will
see 26, but maybe not 10.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.290
10 is little bit
more complicated.

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.820
Most people voted
for my option one,

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.010
so that means you will
be able to see the 26.

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.910
Right.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:31.226
AUDIENCE: Who
[? discovered ?] 26 and 10?

01:03:31.226 --> 01:03:33.892
I mean, they are specific
for this [INAUDIBLE] action

01:03:33.892 --> 01:03:35.975
rate, so for other action
would be something else.

01:03:35.975 --> 01:03:42.560
HONG LIU: Specifically for
the Nambu-Goto action is 26.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.920
And for the 10, you need to
add some additional fermions

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.010
and make it into a so-called
superstring, then become 10.

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:53.800
And even this 26 one is not
completely self-consistent.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.070
And anyway, there's still
some little, tiny problems

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:56.990
with this.

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:58.264
Anyway, so normally we use 10.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:08.420
OK so now, then there's
some tantalizing hints

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:13.317
for the-- say, maybe you
cannot do it with the 3 plus 1

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:14.650
dimensional uncompact spacetime.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:18.160
Maybe you can do a 4 plus
1 dimensional uncompact.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.554
So the first is the
holographic principle,

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:23.470
where you have length.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:31.130
Holographic principle we have
learned because there we say,

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:34.190
if you want to describe
a theory with gravity,

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.650
then this gravity should
be able to be described

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:39.760
by something on its boundary.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.956
And the string theory is
a theory with gravity.

01:04:42.956 --> 01:04:44.330
So if the string
theory should be

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:49.010
equivalent to some kind of
QCD, some kind of gauge theory

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:52.820
without gravity, and then
from holographic principle,

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.080
this field theory maybe should
be one lower dimension, OK?

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.588
In one lower dimension.

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.480
Is the logic here clear?

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.520
AUDIENCE: Wait, can
you say that again?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.480
HONG LIU: So here we
want to equate large N

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.670
QCD with some string theory.

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.660
But string theory we
know contains gravity.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.550
A list of all our
experience contain gravity.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:22.240
But if you believe that
the gravity should satisfy

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.580
holographic principle, then the
gravity should be equivalent,

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.010
according to
holographic principle,

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:34.400
gravity in, say, D
dimensional spacetime

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.490
can be described by
something on its boundary,

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:40.879
something one dimension lower.

01:05:40.879 --> 01:05:42.920
AUDIENCE: But I thought
the holographic principle

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.560
was a statement about entropy.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.550
HONG LIU: No, it's
a state started

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.760
from a statement about entropy.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.330
But then you do a
little bit of leap.

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:54.140
So what I call it little
bit of a conceptual leap

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:58.410
is that the-- or
[? little ?] leap of faith

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:01.490
is that you promote that
into the statement that

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.200
said the number
of degrees freedom

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.060
you needed to describe
the whole system.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.280
Yeah, so the
holographic principle

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.260
is that for any region, even
the quantum gravity theory,

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.960
for any region, you should
be able to describe it

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.204
by the degrees of freedom living
on the boundary of that region.

01:06:21.204 --> 01:06:23.620
And degrees freedom living on
the boundary of that region,

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.130
then it's one dimensional lower.

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.920
AUDIENCE: Wait, so can I
ask one question about that?

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.160
If I have some region,
some volume in space,

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.450
some closed ball or something.

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:37.334
And I live in a universe which
is, for example, a closed--

01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:39.000
like maybe they live
on some hypersphere

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.160
or something like this.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.190
Then how do I know whether
I'm-- how do I know that

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.129
the information is encoded?

01:06:46.129 --> 01:06:47.920
How do I know whether
I'm inside the sphere

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.450
or outside of the sphere?

01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:51.380
For example, we see
that the entropy that

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.100
has to do with the
sphere basically

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.933
tells you about how
much information can you

01:06:54.933 --> 01:06:56.810
contain inside the sphere.

01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:00.054
But if you live in a universe
which is closed or something,

01:07:00.054 --> 01:07:01.470
then you don't
know whether you're

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:03.040
inside or outside the sphere.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.770
HONG LIU: Yeah, but that's
a difficult question.

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.040
Yeah, if you talk about
closed universe here,

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.840
we are not talking
about closed universe.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.427
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:12.010
HONG LIU: Yes.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.884
AUDIENCE: I thought the
holographic principle

01:07:13.884 --> 01:07:17.130
is that the number of degrees
freedom inside the region

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.914
is actually bounded by the area.

01:07:18.914 --> 01:07:20.330
HONG LIU: Right,
it's bounded by--

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:21.871
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
why is it that we

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:25.169
use that degree of freedom
living on the boundary?

01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:27.210
HONG LIU: There are several
formulations of that.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.251
First is that the total
number of degrees freedom

01:07:29.251 --> 01:07:32.150
in this region is
bounded by the area.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:34.720
And then you can go to the
next step, which is maybe

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.510
the whole region can
be just described

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.170
by these degrees
of freedom living

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:41.915
on the boundary on that region.

01:07:41.915 --> 01:07:46.070
AUDIENCE: Is that because,
say, the state of density

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:50.840
on the boundary [INAUDIBLE]
the state on the boundary

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.720
is proportional to the
area of the boundary?

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.440
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:54.970
Exactly.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.896
That's right.

01:07:56.896 --> 01:08:01.020
AUDIENCE: So here our goal is to
recover the large N theory in 3

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.740
plus 1 dimensions
without gravity.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.090
So we have no gravity.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:05.260
You can't 3 plus 1.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.710
HONG LIU: Right.

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.240
Yeah, so if that is supposed
to be equivalent to the gravity

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.740
theory, and the
gravity [? theory ?]

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.440
to find the
holographic principle,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.510
and then the natural
guess is that

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.740
this non-gravitational
field theory should

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.100
live in one dimensional lower.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:22.917
OK?

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:23.750
So this is one hint.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:31.220
And the second is actually
from the consistency

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.300
of string theory itself.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.020
So this is a little
bit technical.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.260
Again, we will only
be able to explain it

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.460
a little bit later, when we talk
about more details about string

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.580
theory.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.979
You can [? tell, ?] even though
the string theory in this space

01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:02.386
is inconsistent.

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:09.370
But there's a simple way.

01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:13.279
This is-- it's not a simple way.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.990
So what's happening
is the following.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:18.290
So if you consider,
say, a string

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:26.450
propagating in this spacetime,
and there are some symmetries

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:28.750
on the worldsheet.

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.990
And only in the 10
and 26 dimension,

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:35.680
those symmetries are satisfied
quantum mechanically.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.191
And in other dimensions,
those symmetries, somehow,

01:09:38.191 --> 01:09:39.649
even though
classically it's there,

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:41.930
but quantum
mechanically it's gone.

01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.680
And those symmetries
become-- because they

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.193
are gone quantum
mechanically, then

01:09:45.193 --> 01:09:46.359
it leads to inconsistencies.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.189
And it turns out that
there's some other way

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:58.410
you can make that consistent,
to make that symmetry still

01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:01.941
to be valid, is by adding
some new degrees of freedom.

01:10:01.941 --> 01:10:02.440
OK?

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.856
It's just there's
some new degrees

01:10:03.856 --> 01:10:05.785
freedom dynamically generated.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:07.160
And then that new
degrees freedom

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.830
turned out to behave like
an additional dimension.

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.200
OK.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.970
Yeah, this will make
no sense to you.

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:18.970
I'm just saying a consistency
of string theory actually

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:21.060
sometimes can give you
one additional dimension.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.684
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between these inconsistencies,

01:10:23.684 --> 01:10:25.630
talking about anomalies and--

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:27.380
HONG LIU: It is anomalies.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.210
But here it's called
gauge anomalies.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:34.970
It's gauge anomalies is at
the local symmetry anomalies,

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:35.965
which is inconsistent.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.506
AUDIENCE: So just--
maybe this is not

01:10:37.506 --> 01:10:39.960
the time to ask this-- but
are the degrees of freedom

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.530
that you need to save you from
this inconsistency problem.

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:47.280
So do they have to be
extra dimensions of space?

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.080
Or what I'm saying is that if we
need to do string theory in 10

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.390
dimensions, is it really
four dimensions plus six

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:54.350
degrees of freedom?

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.590
Or are they actually six
bona fide spatial dimensions?

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.180
HONG LIU: Oh, this is
a very good question.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:04.920
So if you have--
yeah, this something

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.772
we would be a little bit more
clear just even in-- oh, it's

01:11:08.772 --> 01:11:10.180
very late.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.550
Even the second
part of this lecture

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:15.190
is that here you have
four degrees of freedom,

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:17.440
you have six degrees of freedom.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.632
But turns out, if you
only consider this guy,

01:11:20.632 --> 01:11:23.090
then this four degrees freedom
by itself is not consistent.

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:24.990
It's [? its own ?] violation
of the symmetry at the quantum

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.900
level.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.320
And then you need to add
more, and then one more,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.050
because of course one and
two have extra dimension.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:35.710
Anyway, we can make it more
explicit in next lecture.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:39.920
Here I just throw a remark here.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.610
Anyway, this guy-- this
is purely hindsight.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:50.580
Nobody have realized this
point, this first point,

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.610
nobody have realized it before
this holographic duality

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.410
was discovered.

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.900
Nobody really made
this connection.

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:03.200
And at this point,
saying there should

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.790
be a five-dimensional
string theory

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:11.990
describing gauge theory,
that was made just

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:13.860
before the discovery.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.485
I will mention that
a little bit later.

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.560
Anyway, so now let's-- let
me just maybe finish this,

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.550
and we have a break.

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:32.690
So now let's consider--
suppose there is

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:36.340
a five-dimensional
spacetime, string theory

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.170
in some five-dimensional
spacetime,

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:47.685
say 4 plus 1 dimensional
spacetime that describes QCD.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.410
Then what should be
the property of this Y?

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:58.550
So this Y denotes
some manifold Y. OK?

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:03.850
So as I mentioned, it must have
at least all the symmetries

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:06.010
of the QCD, but not more.

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:10.180
Should have exactly the
same amount of symmetries.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.430
So that means it must have
the translation and Lorentz

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.440
symmetries of QCD.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.420
OK?

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:22.730
So that means the only
metric I can write down

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:23.972
must be of this form.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.570
The only metric
I can write down,

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:40.190
the metric must
be have this form.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:45.480
So this az just some function.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.060
And z is the extra dimension
to a Minkowski spacetime.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.170
And this is some Minkowski
metric for 3 plus 1 dimension.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.170
AUDIENCE: You mean it's like
a prototype to four dimension,

01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:01.525
we have to get the
Minkowski space.

01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:02.150
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.040
Just say whatever
this space, whatever

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.400
is the symmetry of this-- so
the symmetry of this spacetime

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.770
must have the
Poincare-- must have

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:14.190
all the symmetry of the
3 plus 1 dimensional

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:15.770
Minkowski spacetime.

01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:18.550
Then the simplest way, you're
saying that the only way

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:21.040
to do it is just you put the
Minkowski spacetime there

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.140
as a subspace.

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.130
And then you have
one additional space,

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:30.240
and then you can have
one additional dimension.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.530
And then, because
you have to maintain

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:37.170
the symmetries and [INAUDIBLE]
to be thinking then

01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:40.796
you can convince yourself that
the only additional degrees

01:14:40.796 --> 01:14:42.170
freedom in the
metric [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.060
is the overall function.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:48.720
So the function of this
z, and nothing else.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.510
OK.

01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:53.500
AUDIENCE: Can that
be part of kind

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.440
of a scalar in Minkowski space?

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.110
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:00.820
Let me just say,
this is most general

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:13.160
metric, consistent with
four dimensional, 3 plus 1

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.951
dimensional,
Poincare symmetries.

01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:34.590
AUDIENCE: Why this additional
dimension always in a space

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:35.290
part?

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.685
Can it be in a time-like part?

01:15:37.685 --> 01:15:39.665
Like a 3 plus 2?

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:49.406
HONG LIU: Both arguments
suggest it's a space part.

01:15:49.406 --> 01:15:51.530
So because this is just
the boundary of some region

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.970
there's a spatial dimension
[? reduction ?], not time.

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:04.280
So is this clear to you?

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.140
Because you won't have
a Minkowski spacetime,

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.850
so you must have
a Minkowski here.

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:11.970
And then in the prefactor
of the Minkowski,

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:14.390
you can multiply by
anything, any function,

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:17.880
but this function
cannot depend on the X.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.130
It can only depend on
this extra dimension.

01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:23.400
Because if you have anything
which depend on capital X,

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.671
then you have violated
the Poincare symmetry.

01:16:26.671 --> 01:16:28.420
You have violated the
translation [? X. ?]

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:35.290
So the only function you can put
before this Minkowski spacetime

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.949
is a function of this
additional dimension.

01:16:38.949 --> 01:16:40.990
And then by redefining
this additional dimension,

01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:44.360
I can always put this
overall factor in the front.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.280
Yeah, so this
tells you that this

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.070
is the most general metric.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.697
OK?

01:16:49.697 --> 01:16:52.030
So if it's not clear to you,
think about it a little bit

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.530
afterwards.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.250
So these are the
most as you can do.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.850
So that's the end.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:06.520
So you say, you cannot
determine az, et cetera.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:12.840
So this is as most you
can say for the QCD.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:33.950
But if the theory, if the field
theory is scale invariant,

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:39.850
say, conformal field theory,
that normally we call CFT, OK?

01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:41.675
So conformal field theory.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.800
Then we can show this metric.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.387
So let me call this equation 1.

01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:59.605
Then 1 must be
[INAUDIBLE] spacetime.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.893
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
symmetry on the boundary

01:18:05.893 --> 01:18:08.190
as well, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:10.720
HONG LIU: Yeah, I'm
going to show that.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.860
So if the field theory
is scale invariant, that

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.600
means that the fields theory
have some additional symmetry,

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.470
should be satisfied
by this metric.

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:24.590
And then I will show that this
additional scaling symmetry

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:27.780
will make this to precisely
a so-called anti-de Sitter

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.660
spacetime.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.760
AUDIENCE: Field theory,
and then the 3 plus 1.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.610
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:33.110
Right.

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:39.400
If the field theory, say the--
QCD does not have a scale.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.944
It's not scaling right, so
I do not say a QCD anymore.

01:18:41.944 --> 01:18:43.360
Just say, suppose
some other field

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.020
theory, which have
large N expansion, which

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.270
is also scale invariant.

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:51.290
And then the corresponding
string theory

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.864
must be in anti-de
Sitter spacetime.

01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:55.864
AUDIENCE: Are we ever
going to come back to QCD,

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:56.810
or is that a--

01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:59.480
HONG LIU: No, that's it.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.310
Maybe we'll come back to QCD,
but in a somewhat indirect way.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:09.571
Yeah, not to your
real-life, beloved QCD.

01:19:09.571 --> 01:19:11.570
AUDIENCE: So no one's
solved that problem still?

01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.300
HONG LIU: Yeah, no one's
solved that problem yet.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.425
So you still have a chance.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:21.040
So that remains very simple.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.925
So let me just say, then
we will have a break.

01:19:24.925 --> 01:19:25.800
Then we will be done.

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:32.830
I think I'm going
very slowly today.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:57.550
So scale invariant theory--
is invariant under the scaling

01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:02.940
for any constant,
constant lambda.

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.200
So scale invariant
theory should be

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.390
invariant under such a scaling.

01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:17.270
And then now we want to
require this metric also

01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:19.100
have this scaling.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.550
OK?

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:28.068
So now, we require 1
also have such scaling.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.152
That's scaling symmetry.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.940
OK, so we just do a scaling
X mu go to lambda X mu.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:55.320
And then this term will give
me additional lambda squared.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.920
So we see, in order for this
to be the same as before, the z

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.530
should scale the same, OK?

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:07.026
So in order for this to be-- so
we need z to scale as the same,

01:21:07.026 --> 01:21:10.780
in order I can scale
this lambda out.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.220
After I scale this
lambda out, I also

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:25.080
need that a lambda z should be
equal to 1 over lambda az, OK?

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.320
So the scaling symmetry
of that equation

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.810
requires these two conditions.

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.980
So on the scaling of
z, this a lambda z

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.470
should satisfy this condition.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:36.400
Then the lambda will cancel.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.750
So this condition is
important because we

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.160
did scale them homogeneously.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.930
Otherwise, of course,
lambda will not drop out.

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:47.120
And the second condition just
makes sure lambda is canceled.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.240
OK, is it clear?

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:58.470
So now this condition
just determined

01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:06.130
that az must be a
simple power, must

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:09.525
be written as R divided by z.

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:10.952
See, R is some constant.

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:24.765
And now we can write
down the full metric.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.535
So now I've determined
this function up

01:22:29.535 --> 01:22:30.535
to our overall constant.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.650
So the full metric is dS square
equal to R squared divided

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:48.390
by z squared dz squared plus
eta mu, mu, dX mu, dX mu.

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:52.090
And this is
precisely AdS metric,

01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:55.500
written in certain coordinates.

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.064
And then this R, then you adjust
the curvature radius of AdS.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.120
So if you don't know about
anti-de Sitter spacetime,

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.320
it doesn't matter.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.320
So this is the metric, and
the name of this metric

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.180
is anti-de Sitter.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.400
And later we will
explain the properties

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.080
of the anti-de Sitter spacetime.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.660
So now we find, so now
we reach a conclusion,

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.850
is that if I have a
large N conformal field

01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:37.600
theory in Minkowski
D-dimensional space, time.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.040
So this can be applied
to any dimensional.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.610
It's not necessary
[? to be ?] 3 plus 1.

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:53.220
In D-- so this, if it can be
described by a string theory,

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:58.710
should be string
theory in AdS d plus 1.

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:05.380
And in particular, the 1/N here
is related to the g strings

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.300
here, the string coupling here.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.140
So this is what we concluded.

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.020
Yes?

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.920
AUDIENCE: So all we've
shown is that there

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.834
is no obvious inconsistency
with that correspondence.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:27.750
HONG LIU: What do you
mean there's no obvious?

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:29.960
AUDIENCE: As in, we didn't
illustrate any way that they--

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.340
HONG LIU: Sure, I'm just saying
this is a necessary condition.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.370
AUDIENCE: Right, so at
least that is necessary.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.410
HONG LIU: Yeah, this is
a necessary condition.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:42.860
So if you can describe a large
N CFT by our string theory--

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:47.660
and it should be a
string theory-- yeah,

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.450
this proposal works.

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:51.650
This proposal passed
the minimal test.

01:24:53.644 --> 01:24:54.810
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:57.482
So when Maldacena presumably
actually did figure this out,

01:24:57.482 --> 01:24:59.940
you said that this resulted
from the holographic principle,

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.420
like it was just figured
out right before he did it.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:04.330
Was he aware of
the holographic--

01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:06.610
HONG LIU: No, here is
what I'm going to talk.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:21.240
So Maldacena, in 1997, Maldacena
found precisely-- in 1997,

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.205
Maldacena found a few examples
of this, precisely realized

01:25:25.205 --> 01:25:26.220
this.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.310
And not using this mass or using
some completely indirect way,

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:32.455
which we will explain next.

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:39.490
So he found this through
some very indirect way.

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:43.440
But in principle, one
could have realized this

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.010
if one kept those
things in mind.

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:49.470
So now let me tell you a
little bit of the history,

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:52.500
and then we will have a break.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.490
Then we can go home.

01:25:57.764 --> 01:25:59.680
It depends on whether
you want a break or not.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.989
Maybe you don't want a break.

01:26:01.989 --> 01:26:03.905
Yeah, let me tell you a
little bit of history.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.740
So yeah, just to save time,
let me not write it down, just

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.650
say it.

01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:18.830
So in the late '60s
to early '70s, so

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:24.740
string theory was developed to
understand strong interactions.

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:30.650
So understanding strong
interactions was the problem.

01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:34.190
At the time, people were
developing string theory

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.350
to try to understand
strong interactions.

01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:44.190
So in 1971, our friend
Frank, Frank Wilczek,

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:47.070
and other people, they discover
the asymptotic freedom.

01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:50.727
And they established
the Yang-Mills theory

01:26:50.727 --> 01:26:52.310
as a description of
strong interaction

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:55.180
which now have our QCD.

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:58.845
And so that's essentially
eliminated the hope of string

01:26:58.845 --> 01:27:02.690
theory to describe QCD.

01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:05.160
Because the QCD seems
to be very different.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.030
You [? need ?] the
help of string theory

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:10.320
to describe strong
interaction because the QCD

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.650
[INAUDIBLE] gauge theory, it's
very different from the string

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:15.480
theory.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.330
So people soon abandoned
the string theory.

01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:23.050
So now we go to 1974.

01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:30.310
So 1974, a big number of
things were discovered in 1974.

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:32.900
So 1974 was a golden year.

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.580
So first is 't Hooft realized
his large N expansion

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.080
and then realized
that this actually

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.490
looks like string theory.

01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:44.690
And then completely
independently,

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.710
Scherk, Schwarz,
and [? Yoneya, ?]

01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:48.630
they realized that
string theory should

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:51.200
considered a theory of
gravity, rather than

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.660
a theory of strong interaction.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:58.890
So they realized
actually-- it's ironic,

01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:01.920
people started doing string
theory in the '60s and '70s, et

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.420
cetera.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.610
But only in 1974
people realized,

01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:06.616
ah, string theory
always have a gravity

01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:08.490
and should be considered
a theory of gravity.

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:10.480
Anyway, so in
1974, they realized

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.210
the string theory should
be considered as a gravity.

01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:18.270
So that was a very, very
exciting realization,

01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:21.020
because then you can have
[? quantum ?] gravity.

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.620
But by that time, people had
given up on string theory.

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.490
So nobody cared about this
important observation.

01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:31.290
Nobody cared about this
important observation.

01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:33.680
So, also in the
same year, in 1974,

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.420
Hawking discovered
his Hawking radiation.

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.245
And they established that
black hole mechanics is really

01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:41.580
a thermodynamics.

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.440
Then really established
that the black hole

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.260
is a thermodynamic object,

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:51.070
And in 1974 there's also a
lot of important discovery--

01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:52.730
which is related
to MIT, so that's

01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:57.890
why I'm mentioning it-- is that
people first really saw quarks

01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:02.770
experimentally, is that, again,
our friend, colleague Samuel

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:06.720
Ting at Brookhaven,
which they discovered

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.820
a so-called charmonium, which
is a bounce state of the charm

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.830
quark and the anti-charm quark.

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:14.970
And because the charm
quark is very heavy,

01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:16.760
so they form a
hydrogen-like structure.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:21.070
So in some sense, the charmonium
is the first-- you first

01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:23.590
directly see the quarks.

01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:27.280
And actually, even after the
1971, after asymptotic freedom,

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.590
many people do not believe QCD.

01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:31.010
They did not believe in quarks.

01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:33.930
They say, if there's quarks,
why don't we see them?

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:43.360
And then in 1974, Samuel Ting
discovered this charmonium

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.690
in October.

01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:47.750
And so people call it
the October Revolution.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:51.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.818
Do you know why they laugh?

01:29:56.818 --> 01:29:57.318
OK.

01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:02.260
Anyway.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:02.760
Yeah.

01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:11.400
Yeah, because I
saw your emotions,

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.080
I think you have
very good composure.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:20.900
Anyway, in the same
year, in 1974, Wilson

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.790
proposed what we now
call the lattice QCD,

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.760
so he put the QCD
on the lattice.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.070
And then he
invented, and then he

01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:31.570
developed a very
beautiful technique

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:36.520
to show from this putting
QCD on the lattice

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:41.900
that, actually, the quark can
be confined through the strings.

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.750
So the quarks in QCD can be
confined through the strings.

01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:48.850
And that essentially
revived the idea maybe

01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:52.480
the QCD can be a string
theory, because the quarks are

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.550
confined through the strings.

01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:58.460
And this all happened in 1974.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:03.206
So then I mentioned the
same, in the late '80s

01:31:03.206 --> 01:31:04.830
and the early '90s,
people were looking

01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:07.290
at these so-called
matrix models, the matrix

01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:08.500
integrals, et cetera.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.910
Then they showed they related
to lower dimensional string

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:12.280
theory.

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.360
But nobody-- yeah, they
showed this related

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:19.060
to some kind of lower
dimensional string theory.

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:24.740
And then in 1993 and
1994, then 't Hooft

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:28.060
had this crazy idea of
this holographic principle.

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:32.080
And he said maybe, things
about the quantum gravity

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.220
can be described by things
living on the boundary.

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.770
And again, it's a crazy idea.

01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:39.970
Very few people paid
attention to it.

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:45.880
But the only person who picked
it up is Leonard Susskind.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:51.520
And then he tried to come up
with some sort of experiments

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.800
to show that that
idea is not so crazy.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.080
Actually, Susskind wrote a
very sexy name for his paper.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.660
It's called "The
World As a Hologram."

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:08.890
And so that paper
received some attention,

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:13.990
but still, still, people did
not know what to make of it.

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.920
And then in 1995, Polchinski
discovers so-called D-branes.

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:27.280
And then we go to 1997.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.910
So in 1997, first in
June, so as I said,

01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:35.560
that QCD may be some
kind of string theory.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.000
This idea is a
long idea, starting

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.160
from the 't Hooft and
large N expansion, and also

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.630
from the Wilson's picture
of confining strings

01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:47.320
from the lattice QCD, etc.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.870
But it's just a
very hard problem.

01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:51.927
If from QCD, how can you
come up with a string theory?

01:32:51.927 --> 01:32:52.760
It's just very hard.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.680
Very few people
are working on it.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.640
So in 1997, in June,
Polyakov finally, he

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.389
said, had a breakthrough.

01:33:01.389 --> 01:33:02.930
He said that this
consistent [? of ?]

01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:06.700
string theory give you
one extra dimension,

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.910
you should consider a
five-dimensional string

01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:12.220
theory rather than a
four-dimensional string theory.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:17.160
And then he gave up
some arguments, anyway.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:23.837
And he almost always actually
write down this metric

01:33:23.837 --> 01:33:26.420
And maybe he already wrote down
this metric, I don't remember.

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.510
Anyway, he was
very close to that.

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:30.710
But then in November,
then Maldacena

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:33.660
came up with this idea of CFT.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.700
And then he provided
[? explicit ?]

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:40.020
examples of certain large
N gauge theories, which

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:42.600
is scale invariant
and some string

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.640
theory in certain
anti-de Sitter spacetime.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.691
And as I said, through
the understanding

01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:50.440
of these D-branes.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.952
But even Maldacena's
paper, he did

01:33:54.952 --> 01:33:59.840
not-- he was still thinking from
the picture of large N gauge

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.010
theory corresponding
to some string theory.

01:34:02.010 --> 01:34:06.680
He did not make the connection
to the holographic principle.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.430
He did not make a connection
to the holographic principle.

01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:14.640
But very soon, in February
1998, Witten wrote the paper,

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.020
and he made the connection.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:19.730
He said, ah, this is precisely
the holographic principle.

01:34:19.730 --> 01:34:22.910
And this example, he said,
ah, this example is precisely

01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:25.860
the holographic
principle Susskind

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.410
and 't Hooft was talking about.

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.620
So that's a brief history
of how people actually

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.970
reached this point.

01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:40.870
So the next stage,
what we are going to do

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:47.430
is to try to derive [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:51.530
So now we can-- as I
said, we have two options.

01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:54.330
We can just start
from here, assuming

01:34:54.330 --> 01:34:59.180
there is CFT [? that's ?]
equivalent to some string

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.150
theory.

01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:04.080
And then we can see how we
can develop this further.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.570
And this is one
option we can take.

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:09.620
And our other option
is to really see

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.550
how this relation actually
arises from string theory.

01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:17.190
And many people voted
for the second option,

01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:18.980
which in my [? email ?]
is option one.

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.860
So you want to see
how this is actually

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.140
deduced from string theory.

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.750
So now we will do that, OK?

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:35.910
But I should warn you, there
will be some technicality

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:38.440
you have to tolerate.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.445
You wanted to see how
this is derived, OK?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So we do a lot of
[? 20 ?] minutes today?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.881
Without break?

01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:50.380
Good.

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:50.980
OK.

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.730
Yeah, next time, I
will remember to break.

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:12.410
OK.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.970
So now we are going
to derive this.

01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:23.410
So first just as
a preparation, I

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:26.580
need to tell you a little
bit more about string theory.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:31.070
In particular, the
spectrum of closed strings,

01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:32.285
closed and open strings.

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:43.180
And so this is
where the gravity--

01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:45.440
and from a closed string
you will see the gravity,

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.773
and from the open string, you
will see the gauge theory.

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:52.920
OK.

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.560
We will see gravity
and gauge theory.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.130
So these are the first
things we will do.

01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:12.600
So the second thing we will do--
so the second thing we will do

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.410
is to understand the
physics of D-branes.

01:37:20.670 --> 01:37:24.300
So D-brane is some
object in string theory.

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:29.490
And it turned out to play
a very, very special role,

01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:33.480
to connect the gravity
and the string theory.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.120
OK.

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.010
Connect the gravity
and the string theory.

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:39.800
Because this is the
connection between the gravity

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.790
and the string theory.

01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:45.380
And in string theory,
this [? object will ?]

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.060
deeply and precisely
play this role,

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.101
which connects the gravity
and the string theory.

01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.060
So that's why you can
deduce such a relation.

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.086
OK.

01:37:53.086 --> 01:37:54.710
Yeah, so this is the
two things we will

01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:56.620
do before we can derive this.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.810
So this is, say,
the rough plan we

01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:11.830
will do before we can
derive this gravity.

01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:14.920
So first let's tell you a little
bit more about string theory.

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.930
So at beginning, just say
some more general setup

01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:30.230
of string theory.

01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:56.320
So let's consider a string
moving in a spacetime, which

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.560
I denote by M, say, with
the metric ds squared

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.630
equal to g mu mu.

01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:11.670
And this can depend
on X, dX mu, dX mu.

01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:13.440
OK?

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.400
So you can imagine some
general curved spacetime.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.075
Say mu and nu will go
from 0 to 1, to D minus 1.

01:39:22.075 --> 01:39:31.090
So D is the total number of
space dimensions for this M.

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:49.380
So the motion of the string, as
we said quite a few times now,

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:54.750
is the embedding of the
worldsheet to the spacetime.

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:59.760
So this is in the form
of X mu sigma tau.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.010
OK, you parameterize the
worldsheet by two coordinates.

01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:08.170
So I will also write
it as X mu sigma a.

01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:13.260
And the sigma a is equal
to sigma 0, and the sigma

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:15.500
1 is equal to tau sigma, OK?

01:40:18.715 --> 01:40:19.965
And we will use this notation.

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:31.922
So now imagine a surface
embedded in some spacetime.

01:40:31.922 --> 01:40:33.380
And this is the
embedding equation.

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:37.770
Because if you know
those functions,

01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:40.810
then you know precisely how
the surface are embedded, OK?

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:47.870
And because the original
spacetime have a metric,

01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:56.845
then this induced metric
on the worldsheet.

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.086
And this induced metric is
very easy to write down.

01:41:04.086 --> 01:41:07.335
You just plug in this
function into here.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.330
And when you take
the derivative,

01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:15.080
you only worry
that sigma and tau,

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.820
because then that means you're
restricted on the surface,

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.980
when your only
[? value is ?] sigma and tau.

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.900
And then you can
plug this into there.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.130
So you can get the metric, then
can be written in this form.

01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:30.930
Here's sigma a and this sigma b.

01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:31.660
OK?

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:35.440
So remember, sigma a and
sigma b just tau and sigma.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:47.490
And this hab is just equal to
g mu mu, X, partial a, X mu,

01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:50.230
partial b, X nu.

01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.937
OK?

01:41:51.937 --> 01:41:53.020
So this is trivial to see.

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.960
Just plug this into there,
to the variation with sigma

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.000
and tau, you just get
that, and it's that.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.200
OK?

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200
Is it clear?

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:20.420
So this Nambu-Goto action
is the tension-- tension

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:26.765
we always write this 1
over 2 pi alpha prime-- dA.

01:42:26.765 --> 01:42:32.230
So alpha prime is the
[INAUDIBLE] dimensions square.

01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:38.270
So we often also write
alpha prime as ls square.

01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:40.520
So alpha prime, just
a parameter, too.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.770
Parameterize to [? load ?]
the tension of the string.

01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:48.410
So this area, of
course, you can just

01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:55.350
write it as d squared sigma.

01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:58.210
So again, you use the
notation d squared sigma

01:42:58.210 --> 01:43:01.140
just d sigma d tau.

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.520
d squared sigma minus delta h.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.020
OK.

01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.603
So this is just the
area, because this

01:43:07.603 --> 01:43:11.354
is the induced metric
on the worldsheet.

01:43:11.354 --> 01:43:13.770
Then you take the determinant,
and that give you the area.

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:15.519
So this is the standard
geometric formula.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.850
So now let me call
this equation 1.

01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:25.237
So I have a [? lot ?]
equation 1 before,

01:43:25.237 --> 01:43:26.320
but this is a new chapter.

01:43:31.783 --> 01:43:32.470
OK.

01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:36.570
So this is the explicit form
of this Nambu-Goto action.

01:43:36.570 --> 01:43:40.160
But this action is a
little bit awkward,

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.720
because involving
the square root.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.660
A square root, it's
considered to be

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:48.980
not a good thing in physics.

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.030
Because when you
write down action,

01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:52.280
because it's a non-polynomial.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.602
We typically like
polynomial things.

01:43:56.602 --> 01:43:59.060
Because the only integral we
can do is a Gaussian integral,

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.351
and the Gaussian is polynomial.

01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:08.810
So this is inconvenient, so one
can rewrite it a little bit.

01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:10.358
So you write down the answer.

01:44:17.850 --> 01:44:22.500
So we can rewrite it
in the polynomial form.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.120
And this polynomial
form is corresponding--

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.930
it's called the Polyakov
action, so I call it SP,

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.900
even though Polyakov had
nothing to do with it.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:39.810
And this action can be
written in the following form.

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:41.600
And let me write
down the answer.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.076
Then I will show the equivalent.

01:44:47.666 --> 01:44:51.390
AUDIENCE: Wasn't it invented
by Leonard Susskind?

01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:53.340
HONG LIU: No, it's
not Leonard Susskind.

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.600
AUDIENCE: Why is it
called Polyakov--

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.900
HONG LIU: Polyakov--
yeah, actually Polyakov

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.180
had something to do with it.

01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:08.060
Polyakov used it mostly
[INAUDIBLE] first.

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.110
OK, so you can rewrite
it as that, in this form.

01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:22.030
And the gamma ab is a
new variable introduced.

01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:25.090
It's a Lagrangian multiplier.

01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:25.590
OK.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.300
So let me point
out a few things.

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:33.980
So this structure is
precisely just this hab.

01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:35.700
So that's if you look
at this structure,

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:41.010
so this structure is
precisely what I called hab.

01:45:41.010 --> 01:45:44.690
So now the claim is
adding [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:48.770
to original variable
with just X. Now

01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:52.520
I introduce a new
variable, gamma.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.480
And gamma is like a
Lagrangian multiplier,

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.730
because there's no
connected term for gamma.

01:45:57.730 --> 01:46:02.860
So if I eliminate gamma,
then I will recover this.

01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:04.430
OK, so this is the claim.

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:05.470
So now let me show that.

01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:12.980
This is very easy to see.

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:19.410
Because if you just do
the variation of gamma,

01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:22.400
do the variation of gamma ab.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.060
OK.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.730
So whenever I wrote in
this is in [? upstairs, ?]

01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:27.940
it always means the inverse.

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:31.352
OK, this is the standard
notation for the metric.

01:46:31.352 --> 01:46:33.560
So if you look at the equation
of motion, [INAUDIBLE]

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.930
by variation of this gamma
ab, then what you'll find

01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:39.929
is that the gamma ab-- just do
the variation of that action.

01:46:39.929 --> 01:46:41.762
You find the equation
of motion for gamma ab

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:42.845
is given by the following.

01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:48.350
So hab, just that guy.

01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:51.374
And the lambda is arbitrary
constant, or lambda

01:46:51.374 --> 01:46:52.856
is arbitrary function.

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.480
So this I'm sure you can do.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:11.060
You just do the variation.

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.060
You find that equation.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:16.940
So now we can just verify
this actually works.

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:22.360
When you substitute this
into here, OK, into here.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:25.560
So this gamma ab, when you take
the inverse, then [? cause ?]

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:30.020
one into the inverse, hab,
inverse hab contracted

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:32.800
with this hab just give you 2.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:38.401
And that 2-- did I put
that 2 in the right place?

01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:43.122
That gave you 2.

01:47:43.122 --> 01:47:49.350
And that have a 2 on-- yeah,
I'm confused about 2 now.

01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:53.020
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:56.310
Anyway, so this
contracted with that,

01:47:56.310 --> 01:48:03.850
so gamma ab contracted with hab
give you 2 divided by lambda,

01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:06.490
times 2.

01:48:06.490 --> 01:48:07.720
OK?

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.690
Because you just invert this
guy and invert the lambda and 2.

01:48:11.690 --> 01:48:17.190
And then square root of
minus gamma give me 1/2

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:21.460
lambda, square root minus h.

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:21.960
OK?

01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:28.230
So sometimes I also approximate.

01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:30.275
I will not write this
determinant explicitly.

01:48:30.275 --> 01:48:32.650
When I write [? less h, ?] it
means the determinant of h.

01:48:32.650 --> 01:48:34.970
And the minus gamma,
determinant of gamma.

01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:35.770
OK?

01:48:35.770 --> 01:48:39.350
So you multiply these two
together, so these two cancel.

01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:43.240
And this two, multiply
this 4 pi alpha prime,

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.194
and then get back that, OK?

01:48:46.194 --> 01:48:47.110
So they're equivalent.

01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:51.930
Clear?

01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:54.264
So this gives you [? SNG. ?]

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:10.350
So now the key-- so now
if you look at this form,

01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:17.410
this really have a
polynomial form for X, OK?

01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:21.940
So now let me call
this equation 2.

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:26.280
So equation 2, if you
look at that expression,

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.880
just has the form--
so this is just

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:33.560
like a two-dimensional
field theory-- has

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:38.320
the form of a
two-dimensional scalar field

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:50.917
theory in the curved spacetime.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:03.030
Of course, the curved spacetime
is just our worldsheet sigma

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:10.298
with metric gamma ab, OK?

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:26.400
So this is just like--
but the key here,

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.225
so sometimes 2 is called the
nonlinear sigma model, just

01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:32.480
traditionally, a
theory of the form

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.120
that equation 2 is called
the nonlinear sigma model.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.640
Nonlinear because typically
this metric can depend on X,

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.550
and so dependence
on X is nonlinear.

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:43.802
So it's called
nonlinear sigma model.

01:50:43.802 --> 01:50:51.328
But I would say it's both
gamma ab and X are dynamical.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.570
Are dynamical variables.

01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:12.900
So that means when you
do the path integral,

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:19.926
so in the path
integral quantization,

01:51:19.926 --> 01:51:21.800
you need to integrate
over all possible gamma

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:24.010
ab and all possible X mu.

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.820
Not only integrate
over all possible X mu,

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:31.270
but also integrate all possible
gamma ab with this action.

01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:41.860
OK.

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:46.060
So this is a
two-dimensional [? world ?]

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.810
with some scalar field.

01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:52.060
And you integrate over
all possible metric,

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:56.100
so over all possible intrinsic
metric in that [? world. ?]

01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:07.810
So this can also be
considered as 2D gravity,

01:52:07.810 --> 01:52:16.538
two-dimensional gravity,
coupled to D scalar fields.

01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:29.400
So now we see that when
you rewrite anything

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:36.120
in this polynomial form,
in this Polyakov form,

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.730
the problem of
quantizing the string

01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:44.010
become the problem of quantizing
two-dimensional gravity coupled

01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:47.050
to D scalar fields.

01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:48.020
OK.

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.470
So this may look very scary,
but it turns out actually

01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:55.150
two-dimensional
gravity is very simple.

01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:56.490
So it's actually not scary.

01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:58.700
So in the end, for
many situations,

01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.637
this just reduced to,
say, a quantizing scalar

01:53:01.637 --> 01:53:03.220
field with a little
bit of subtleties.

01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.782
So yeah, let's stop here.

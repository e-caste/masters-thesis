00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.279
The development of the incandescent light
bulb took many years and relied on the talents

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.039
of many inventors from around the world. One
of the key changes was the use of an inert

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:17.350
gas, rather than a vacuum, in the bulb itself.
In this video, we'll use the kinetic theory

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.590
of gases to explain why the addition of an
inert gas had such a significant impact on

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.110
the usability and longevity of the humble
incandescent bulb.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.440
This video is part of the Governing Rules
video series. A small number of rules describe

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.659
the physical and chemical interactions that
are possible in our universe.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.429
Hi. My name is Jeff Grossman and I am a professor
in the Department of Materials Science and

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.149
Engineering at MIT.
Today, I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.539
development of the incandescent light bulb.
In order to understand the topic of this video,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.829
you should be familiar with the kinetic theory
of gases.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.519
After watching this video, you should be able
to discuss the physical significance of a

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.390
gas molecule's mean free path. You should
also be able to discuss the physical parameters

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.689
that affect the mean free path.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.240
Imagine that you are a consultant for a light
bulb manufacturer. They have a problem with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.140
their incandescent light bulbs. After the
light bulbs have been operating for a period

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.920
of time, the inner walls of the bulb begin
to blacken. This reduces the light output.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.189
Not a desirable outcome for a light bulb.
You have been hired to figure out why this

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.380
is happening and to determine a way to fix
the problem.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.479
So, what questions do you have? What do you
think is going on? What chemical principles

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.960
might be important here? Take a moment to
pause the video and jot down some things that

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.960
you think might be relevant to the problem.
It's okay to brainstorm with a partner.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.469
It may be helpful to understand a few things
about the construction of the light bulb.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.469
Looking inside, we see that there is a coil
of metal, called the filament. This filament

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.510
is typically made of tungsten. What you can't
see is that the inside of this light bulb

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.510
is a vacuum. What would happen if there was
air in the light bulb? Because the filament

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.610
reaches such high temperatures, the filament
will oxidize if oxygen is present.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.360
Some of you may have been wondering about
the temperature of the tungsten filament.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.360
When the light bulb is on, the tungsten filament
gets very hot, around 3000 Â°C.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.450
While this temperature is below the melting
and boiling points for tungsten, the occasional

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.450
tungsten atom sublimes and condenses on the
wall of the light bulb. Not only does this

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.480
reduce the light output of the bulb, but it
also causes deterioration of the filament.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.230
Knowing what you know about gases, how can
you explain what is happening and what solution

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.200
might you propose?
It might help to review some of the assumptions

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.790
of the kinetic theory of gases.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.260
One assumption is that the molecules in a
gas are separated by distances that are much

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.870
larger than the size of the molecules themselves.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.000
Another is that the molecules are constantly
moving in random directions.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.920
The molecules obey Newton's laws of motion
and thus continue in straight-line motion

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.050
until they collide with other molecules or
the walls of the container.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.050
Gas molecules that are not in physical contact
do not exert forces on one another, so between

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.440
collisions, they move with constant velocity.
Collisions between molecules or between a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.660
molecule and the wall of the container are
assumed to be perfectly elastic. In other

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.900
words, energy is conserved.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.250
What factors do you think affect a molecule's
collision frequency? Pause the video and take

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.060
a moment to think about it.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.330
You may have realized that the diameter of
a molecule, as well as the number of molecules

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.400
in the region will affect collision frequency.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.400
So when a tungsten atom evaporated off of
the hot filament under vacuum, what happened?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.510
Pause the video and take a moment to think
about it.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.470
The atom proceeded in a straight line, and
in the absence of other molecules to collide

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.040
with, condensed on the cool wall of the light
bulb. Under vacuum, the mean free path of

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.260
tungsten atoms in the vapor state is quite
large.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.370
What is the mean free path?

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.850
The mean free path is the average distance
traveled by a molecule between collisions.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.180
The mean free path for a molecule can be approximated
by the distance traveled by the molecule in

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.280
a given time t divided by the number of collisions
the molecule experienced.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.760
Although the molecule may exhibit a random
walk and change direction with each collision

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.220
it experiences, we are simply interested in
the scalar quantity of total distance traveled.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.810
The total distance traveled can be found by
multiplying the velocity of the molecule by

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.240
the time.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.460
How do we find the number of collisions? Let's
break this down.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.000
If we assume that the molecule is spherical
with diameter d, as it moves, it will sweep

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
out a cylindrical volume equal to pi*r-squared*vt.
As a first approximation, let's assume that

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.210
our molecule is moving through other gas molecules
of the same diameter. Any molecule whose center

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.550
lies within a distance r of this cylinder
will collide with our molecule of interest.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.800
So to find the number of collisions, we need
to look at the volume pi*d-squared*vt and

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.260
multiply this by the density of gas molecules
n sub v.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.560
We're not quite done. When looking at the
number of collisions, we need to keep in mind

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.169
that all of the gas molecules are moving,
so we should use a relative velocity. The

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.080
relative velocity is equal to square root
of 2 multiplied by the average velocity.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.080
It would be good for you to think about how
we got this.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.100
So now we have this expression for the mean
free path.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.060
What would happen to the mean free path of
a tungsten atom if we introduced other gas

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.060
molecules into the bulb? Would the mean free
path increase, decrease, or stay the same?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:28.480
Pause the video and take a moment to think
about it.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.400
You might have realized that by introducing
other gas molecules into the light bulb, we

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.840
can increase the number of collisions a tungsten
atom will experience and decrease its mean

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.840
free path. Would this be desirable or undesirable?
Why?

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:52.940
Decreasing a tungsten atom's mean free path
is desirable. While some vaporized tungsten

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.610
atoms will still condense on the walls of
the light bulb, some collisions will result

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.520
in tungsten atoms re-condensing on the filament.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.479
You may have noticed blackening near the top
of incandescent bulbs after they have been

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:13.340
used for a while. Heat transfer from the filament
to the fill gas creates convection currents

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:20.229
that carry many of the vaporized tungsten
atoms to the top of the bulb where they condense.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:25.330
This localized darkening allows the light
output from other regions of the bulb to remain

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.639
relatively constant.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:32.990
You can see how kinetic theory has helped
us think about this problem. Of course, there

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:38.169
are some other things we need to think about.
For example, what gas should we use? What

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:43.578
properties do you think the gas should have?
Pause the video here and take a moment to

00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:47.309
think about it.

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:54.309
Well, if we are going to fill our light bulb
with gas, we probably want to use something

00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:01.519
that is inert to avoid undesirable reactions.
For common household use, we would also want

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.699
our fill gas to be non-toxic in case the glass
breaks. And of course, low cost is always

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:10.730
desirable.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.649
Irving Langmuir actually solved this problem
when he was working at General Electric in

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:22.649
the early 1900s. Langmuir chose argon as the
fill gas because it is inert and non-toxic,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.449
but if you look at the periodic table you
might ask why he didn't chose a more massive

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:35.449
inert gas. Argon is much lower in cost compared
to other inert gases.

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:41.990
Krypton and xenon are used in more expensive
light bulbs, but not in household light bulbs.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:47.410
Argon continues to be used in standard incandescent
light bulbs, although the use of incandescent

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.230
light bulbs in general is being phased out.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:58.230
To Review, we saw how kinetic theory can be
used to help us analyze a real-world problemâthat

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:05.089
of light bulb blackening. We derived an equation
to allow us to estimate a gas molecule's mean

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:11.949
free path. The mean free path provides an
estimate of the average distance traveled

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:18.850
by a molecule between collisions. We saw that
the mean free path is inversely proportional

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:24.439
to the density of gas molecules. Realizing
that the mean free path of tungsten atoms

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:30.329
in a light bulb was too long helped us think
about what parameters we might manipulate

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:37.329
in order to solve our problem.

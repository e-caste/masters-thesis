00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.280
This week we're
going to take a look

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.820
at exactly what you DO
with the photographs

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.280
after you've made them.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.030
And, once again, frankly we
could devote a full six week

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.540
course to just this idea
alone--presenting your work.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.550
But we'll try to cover
this topic as best we can

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.760
in just a couple of tutorials
for you for this week.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.700
So let's start
with a few figures

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.600
just to dissect them and get
you to think more about how

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.730
you create figures
with your images.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.509
Let's first take
a look at a figure

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.050
that the researchers made
for a grant submission.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.840
And here we see a
host of the pieces

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.420
of devices, and the full
devices, all labeled.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.120
They wanted to show what they
were capable of creating--of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.470
course which is important.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.250
But there's so much
going on, the question

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.670
is whether we want to
bother looking anywhere.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.110
By the way, just
a note, I didn't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.310
make any of these
images of the research,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.530
but I knew that a few of the
original images were in color.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.980
So first of all, why
not use the color

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.410
renditions if you have them.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.690
Now, let's concentrate on the
composition of the figure.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.170
Why not somehow find a
way that makes some sort

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140
of compositional sense?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.750
So here, we re-ordered all these
devices according to scale,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840
so we're giving the
readers some idea

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.370
of how to look at
this very busy figure.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.620
In addition, we removed
most of the labeling

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.310
and we created a
key to the images.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.280
And that key would be
labelled with letters,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
so that if you wanted more
information about this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.620
particular image within the
figure, for example its scale,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.400
like this one, you would then
find that letter in the caption

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240
and get more information.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.340
So, you might not agree (but
I hope you do) if you look

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.229
at them side-by-side, I hope
you see that, once again:

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.590
by simplifying, editing down
your figures to the essential

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.960
pieces, and organize
them to tell your story,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.169
that the reader--and in this
case grant reviewer--enjoys

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.940
looking at your figure and
understands the contents

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.320
of your figure.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.190
If you're using up space in
your article, your presentation,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.250
or your grant
submission, why not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.440
use that space so that the
viewers actually want to look.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.060
In this example, you are
seeing two photographs

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.550
that I made quite a
while ago, depicting

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.910
two ends of a long device.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.990
The device was too long
to get into one frame.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.380
So the researcher used these
two photographs in one figure.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.600
The left and the right
side of the device

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.930
are combined, indicating
that it's much longer,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.340
as you can see
with this notation.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.730
And we see all sorts of labels
and arrows and SEM inserts.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.760
What I suggested first from
the very beginning is--please,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.680
give us a little more
space to breathe!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.570
So many figures are packed
so tightly with stuff,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.030
and we actually don't know how
to even start looking at it.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.190
So for example, adding
space around the perimeter,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.320
is what I did here by inserting
the whole figure into an area

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.930
with a larger canvas size.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.430
And then, I questioned
the labeling.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.180
If you are labeling
within an image,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.120
it's imperative to
simplify your labeling

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.310
and clean it up and
make it nice and neat.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.100
And here's what mean by that.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.550
Try to put all your labels
lined up as best you you can,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.710
either vertically and
/ or horizontally.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.579
Next, question
whether you really

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.840
have to use a combination of
upper- and lower-case letters.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.410
Why not make all of
your labels lower-case.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.430
Get rid of your arrows.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.770
Arrows with arrowheads are
completely unnecessary.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.270
They are distractions as labels.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.880
Lines without the arrow
heads are much better to use.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.850
They're just more refined.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.500
Rethink your colors.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.750
How about using blue
instead of fuscia?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.830
Please?

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.000
So, I hope you agree that this
is cleaner way of labelling

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.080
your figures.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.740
And, in the end, I also
questioned the need

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.740
for the SEM inserts.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.360
I'm not sure we are really
see more information

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.810
about the structure
of the device

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.250
with these additional SEMs.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.980
The optical image says
all that we want to say.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.620
And so I would have
deleted the SEMs.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.140
But if you insist on including
inserts (maybe because, you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.070
just wanted to show that you
were capable of making them,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.070
which is fine)...

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.159
At the very least, orient
the inserts in the way

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.370
that the rest of the
optical image is oriented.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.880
Here we're rotating these
SEM inserts 90 degrees

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.310
to make them more relevant
to the full image.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.470
And now let's look
at them side by side.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.940
Once again, I hope
that you agree

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.630
that the re-do is a much cleaner
and simplified figure, which

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.230
makes it much more accessible.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.140
Let's look at another figure.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.330
This photograph up here,
made by the researcher,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.000
shows the device.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.750
And here you see
yet another point

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.860
of view of that same device.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.810
Down here we have a CAD drawing
to represent an important part

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.700
of the device where E. coli
or traveling from one chamber

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.770
to another.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.480
And this other final
piece of the figure

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.680
is a micrograph of that very
same important connection

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.250
between the two chambers.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.420
The question is, number
one, are these photographs

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.880
more than "good enough"?

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.190
I know that we talk
about this a lot,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.490
but it's really important
to think about it.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.500
It's pretty clear when you put
a photograph in your figure,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.940
it's important to have the
best photograph you can make.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.980
I wasn't convinced
that these images were

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.350
the best they could
be, and so I offered

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.290
to make another
representation of the device.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.370
And so, here, this is
the image that I made,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.520
which, I hope you
agree, looks better.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.970
We decided to replace the
first picture in the graphic.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.880
The next question
is something I feel

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.480
pretty important to consider.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.780
In this next photograph,
ask ourselves:

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.230
are we really giving
more information,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.040
or, frankly, is
it just redundant.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.690
So we collaboratively
decided that it's not

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.520
an important piece
in the figure.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.909
It's not saying anything that
we are not already saying.

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.400
So we deleted it.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.860
We're simplifying, we're
editing down the figure

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.500
to the essential pieces.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.730
After I looked at other images
that they made in the lab,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.250
I suggested that we
include a fluorescing image

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.750
from their files of E.
coli going from one chamber

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.460
to the next, to sort of
match the lower right

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.250
SEM of the same area.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.230
And they agreed.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.110
And what I also suggested was
to invert the fluorescing image

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.370
so that it would work well
with the rest of the pieces.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.930
After all remember
fluorescence in this situation

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.520
is basically a
tagging technique,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.310
telling us evidence
of the presence

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.710
of a particular structure,
in this case E.coli.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.820
We are not measuring or
quantifying florescence--and

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.400
we'll talk about that later when
we discuss image manipulation.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.900
So in this case
it's perfectly fine

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.830
to reverse the grayscale
image, making this piece easier

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.530
to read.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.890
So we replaced the
image we deleted,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.310
with this fluorescing image.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.310
The researchers then decided
they preferred another CAD

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.170
drawing to replace the
first one, which is fine.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.320
And finally, we aligned
and resized all the images

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.470
to give us equal framing.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.730
So we finally came up with we
believed was a clearer figure.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.000
Less redundant.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.090
And it worked quite
well, as you can

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.000
see, in the published paper.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.650
So we should compare
them side-by-side,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.640
and once again, I hope you
can see that second one is

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.580
a marked improvement.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.010
This is what we do on campus.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.780
We work together in
groups to dissect

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.640
all sorts of draft submissions.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.330
It really works very
well, I encourage

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.820
you to do the same
on your own campuses.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.430
Here's another figure that
another group of researchers

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.360
put together.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.550
The tin sulphide powder which
yields some information,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.770
then becomes deposited--and
we see that somehow in an SEM

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.630
of that layer--and ultimately
the idea is to show how

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.909
the researchers fabricated
this solar cell.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.140
It's about process.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.370
So we went through
a whole series

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.520
of iterations and questions.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.700
I've edited them
down here so you

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.210
can see a number of the
attempts by the researchers.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.590
So when I came into
the picture, I first

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.000
questioned whether
the graph really had

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.210
to be included in this figure.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.830
Perhaps it could be have
been placed elsewhere

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.910
in the article.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.080
And then we discussed
whether it was

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.480
important to show the powder.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.130
They asked that i come
up with another way

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.610
of portraying the tin sulphide.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.640
I tried it in vials.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.100
I then suggested putting the
SEM within an illustration,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.200
showing the various layers.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.870
And then I made a photograph of
the solar cell, which I think

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.250
is better from their
rendition, I hope you agree.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.900
And we eventually evolved
the final figure into this.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.440
We concentrated on the
picture of the solar cell.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.880
Did not need the
vials of powder,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.310
just showing the
layers of the material.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.940
Much easier for the reader
to see and understand what

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.570
is going on in this figure.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.810
Again, editing and simplifying.

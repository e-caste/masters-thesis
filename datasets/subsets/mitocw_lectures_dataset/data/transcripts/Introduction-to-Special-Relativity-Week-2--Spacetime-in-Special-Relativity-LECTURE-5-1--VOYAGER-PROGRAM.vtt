00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.372
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.330
In this section, you're
going to take a journey

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.300
through our solar
system and beyond.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.780
1977 marks the first flight
of the Voyager program.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.220
Voyager is an MIT-led program
with the original mission

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.770
to study planetary systems.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.340
Now, Voyager 1 and Voyager
2, two spacecrafts,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.920
are studying the
interstellar space.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.770
Those two probes are
still sending back now,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.800
more than 40 years
later, information

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.210
about measurement of their
surroundings back to Earth.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.830
Those are the two furthest-away
objects we were able to send.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.690
What we have here in 8.20--

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.580
and it's IAP, so we are a
little bit more ambitious--

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.790
our mission is to bring
us to Alpha Centauri.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.850
Alpha Centauri is the
closest star and planetary

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.150
system to our solar system.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.330
It's actually not just one
star, but multiple stars.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.750
And our journey brings
us to Proxima B,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.860
which is a planet in the
Alpha Centauri system.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.380
So we have a very
fancy spacecraft.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.710
It's able to travel with a
constant velocity of 0.943 c,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.720
speed of light.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.790
The gamma factor is 3, and the
path which it's going to take

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.700
is 5 light years long.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
Alice is our ground control.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.010
She is going to stay on Earth.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.720
And Bob is going to take this
journey with Virgin Galactic.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.180
After some time, Bob is
going to arrive on Proxima B.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.570
So your first challenge
is to now calculate

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.410
how long does this trip
take from Alice's and Bob's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.280
perspective?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.780
So I ask you to stop the video
here and just work this out.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.570
So for Alice, the time
needed is 5 light years

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.320
divided by 0.9, by
the velocity of 0.943,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.700
times the speed of light.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.490
And that gives us 5.3 years.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.070
So after 5.3 years, Alice
is observing Bob's arrival

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.970
on Proxima B. For Bob,
the length of this path

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.270
is Lorentz contracted--

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.460
5 light years
divided by 3, which

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.500
is the gamma factor, which
results to 1.67 light years.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.610
So for him, the journey
takes only 1.77 years--

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.380
1.67 light years divided by
0.943 times the speed of light.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.690
So apparently, the time
experienced by Alice and Bob

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.700
for the very same
journey is different.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.490
So this now is the
first part, where

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.690
we enter discussions
of paradoxes

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.130
in special relativity.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.810
And this will bring
us, ultimately,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.720
to an understanding of the twin
paradox later in this course.

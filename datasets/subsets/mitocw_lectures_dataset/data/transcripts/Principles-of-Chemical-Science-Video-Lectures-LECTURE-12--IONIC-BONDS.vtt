00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.660
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
get started here.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.350
Go ahead and take 10 more
seconds on the clicker

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.100
question, which probably looks
all too familiar at this

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.770
point, if you went to recitation
yesterday.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.370
All right, and let's
see how we do here.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.900
OK.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.540
So, let's talk about this
for one second.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.830
So what we're asking here, if we
can settle down and listen

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.440
up, is which equations can be
used if we're talking about

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.590
converting wavelength to
energy for an electron.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.260
Remember, the key word
here is electron.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.060
This might look familiar to the
first part of problem one

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.230
on the exam, and problem one on
the exam is what tended to

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.290
be the huge problem
on the exam.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.310
I think over 2/3 of you decided
on the exam to use

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.530
this first equation, e equals
h c over wavelength.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.250
So I just want to reiterate one
more time, why can we not

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.720
use this equation if we're
talking about an electron?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.500
C. OK, good, good,
I'm hearing it.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.990
So the answer is c.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.430
What you need to do is you need
to ask yourself if you're

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.810
trying to convert from
wavelength to energy for an

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.820
electron, and you are tempted,
because we are all tempted to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.800
use this equation, and if you
were tempted, say, does an

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.280
electron travel at the
speed of light?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.150
And if the answer is no, an
electron does not travel at

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.570
the speed of light, light
travels at the speed of light,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.290
then you want to stay away
from using this equation.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.440
And I know how tempting it is to
do that, but we have other

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.320
equations we can use -- the
DeBroglie wavelength, and this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.560
is just a combination of energy
equals 1/2 m v squared,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740
and the definition of momentum,
so we can combine

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.540
those things to get it.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.110
You might be wondering why I'm
telling you this now, you've

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.500
already -- if you've lost
points on that, lost the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.200
points on it, and what I'm
saying to you is if there are

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.790
parts of exam 1 that you did not
do well on, you will have

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.900
a chance to show us again that
you now understand that

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.360
material on the final.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.940
One quarter of the final is
going to be exam 1 material,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.290
and what that means is when we
look at your grade at the end

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.090
of the semester, and we take a
look at what you got on exam

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.810
1, and you're right at that
borderline, and we say well,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.630
what happened, did they
understand more at the end of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.090
the semester, did the
concepts kind of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.710
solidify over the semester?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.210
And if they did and if you
showed us that they did, then

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.840
you're going to get bumped up
into that next grade category.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.730
So keep that in mind as you're
reviewing the exam, sometimes

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.150
if things don't go as well
as you want them to, the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.180
temptation is just to put that
exam away forever and ever.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.720
But the reality is that new
material builds on that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.610
material, and specifically exam
1 a, question 1 a that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.740
deals with converting
wavelength to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.410
energy for an electron.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.610
I really want you guys know this
and to understand it, so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.800
I can guarantee you that you
will see this on the final.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.640
Specifically, question
1, part a.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.260
You will see something
very, very similar

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.750
to this on the final.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.930
If you are thinking about 1
thing to go back and study on

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.420
exam 1, 1 a is a really
good choice for that.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.820
This is important to me,
so you're going to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.110
see it on the final.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.960
So if you have friends that
aren't here, you might want to

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.270
mention it to them, or maybe
not, maybe this is your reward

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.480
for coming to class, which
is fine with me as well.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.840
All right.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.070
So I want to talk a little
bit about exam 1.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.320
I know most you picked up your
examine in recitation.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.020
If you didn't, any extra exams
can be picked up in the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.410
Chemistry Education office,
that's room 2204.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.780
So, the class average for the
exam was a 68%, which is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.890
actually a strong, solid average
for an exam 1 grade in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.610
the fall semester of 511-1.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.280
What we typically see is
something right in this range,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.060
either ranging from the 50's
for an exam 1 average to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.110
occasionally getting into the
70's, but most commonly what

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.220
we've seen for exam 1 averages
is 60, 61 -- those low 60's.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.120
So in many ways, seeing this 68
here, this is a great sign

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.740
that we are off to a good
start for this semester.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.060
And I do want to address,
because I know many of you,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.130
this is only your second exam
at MIT, and perhaps you've

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.750
never gotten an exam back that
didn't start with a 90 or

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.570
start with an 80 in terms
of the grades.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.910
So one thing you need to keep in
mind is don't just look at

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.870
the number grade.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.730
The reason that we give you
these letters grade categories

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.190
is that you can understand what
it actually means, what

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.150
your exam score actually says
in terms of how we perceive

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.360
you as understanding
the material.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.030
So, for example, and this is the
same categories that were

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.900
shared in recitation, so I
apologize for repeating, but I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.770
know sometimes when you get an
exam back, no more information

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.180
comes into your head except
obsessing over the exam, so

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.130
I'm just going to say it one
more time, and that is between

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.540
88 and 100, so that's 20% of
you got an A. This is just

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.810
absolutely fantastic, you really
nailed this very hard

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.140
material and these hard
questions on the exam where

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.850
you had to both use equations
and solve problems, but also

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.280
understand the concept in order
to get yourself started

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.910
on solving the problem.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.690
The same with the B, the B range
was between 69 and 87 --

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.280
anywhere in between those
ranges, you've got a B, some

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.100
sort of B on the exam.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.360
So again, if you're in the A or
the B category here, this

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.330
is really something to be proud
of, you really earned

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.130
these grades.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.650
You know these exams, our 511-1
exams, we're not giving

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.900
you points here, there are no
give me, easy points, you

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.870
earned every single one
of these points.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.100
So, A and B here, these are
refrigerator-worthy grades,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.690
hang those up in your dorm.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.560
This is something to
feel good about.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.090
All right.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.890
So, for those of you that got
between a 51 and a 68, this is

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.690
somewhere in the C range.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.240
For some people, they feel
comfortable being in the C

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.280
range, other people really do
not like being in this range.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.950
We understand that, there is
plenty of room up there with

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.940
the A's and the B's.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.930
You are welcome to come up to
these higher ranges starting

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.360
with the next exam.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.010
And what I want to tell you if
you are in the C range, and

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.430
this is not a place that you
want to be in, anyone that's

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.910
got below the class average,
so below a 68 -- or a 68 or

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.850
below, is eligible for free
tutoring, and I put the

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.250
website on the front
page of your notes.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.700
This means you get a one-on-one
tutor paid for by

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.950
the Chemistry Department to
help you if it's concepts

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.315
you're not quite up on, if it's
exam strategy that you

00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:42.020
need to work on more.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.520
Whatever it is that you need
to work on, we want to help

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.350
you get there.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.680
So, if you have a grade that
you're not happy with, that

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.040
you're feeling upset or
discouraged about, please, I'm

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.050
happy to talk to all of
you about your grades

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.940
individually.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.070
You can come talk to me, bring
your exam, and we'll go over

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.810
what the strategy should
be in terms of you

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.070
succeeding on the next exam.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.300
You can do the same thing with
all of your TAs are more than

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.370
happy to meet with each
and every one of you.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.640
And then in addition to that, we
can set you up with a tutor

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.010
if you are in the C range
or below, in terms

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.220
of this first exam.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.570
All right.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.720
So 44 to 50, this is going
to be in the D range.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.390
And then anything below
a 44 is going to be

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.880
failing on this exam.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.860
And also keep in mind, for
those of you that are

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.470
freshman, you need at least
a C to pass the class.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.270
So, if you did get a D or an F
on the first exam, you are

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.980
going to need to really evaluate
why that happened and

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.100
make some changes, and
we're absolutely here

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.530
to help you do that.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.030
So the real key is identifying
where the problem is -- is it

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.240
with understanding the concepts,
are you in a study

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.190
group that's dragging you
along but you're not

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.340
understanding?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.300
Do you kind of panic when
you get in the exam?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.270
There are all sorts of scenarios
we can talk about

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.270
and we want to talk about
them with you.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.610
Seriously, even if we had a huge
range in this exam from

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.420
17 to 100, if you're sitting
there and you're the 17, and

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.505
actually there's more than 1 so
don't feel alone, if you're

00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:05.210
a 17 or you're a 20, it's not
time to give up, it's not time

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.740
to drop the class and
say I'm no good at

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.070
chemistry, I can't do this.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.840
You still can, this is your
first couple of exams,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.400
certainly your first in this
class, potentially one of your

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.690
first at MIT, so there's
tons of room to improve

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.450
from here on out.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.340
This is only 100 points
out of 750.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.610
So, the same thing goes if you
did really well, you still

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.180
have 650 other points that
you need to deal with.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.930
So, make sure you don't just
rest on your high score from

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.270
this first exam.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.150
So, OK, so that's pretty much
what I wanted to say about the

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.280
exam, and in terms of there's
tons of resources if things

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.610
didn't work out quite
as you wanted.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.320
If you feel upset in any way,
please come and talk to me.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.370
We want you to love chemistry
and feel good about your

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.480
ability to do it.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.380
Nobody get into MIT by mistake,
so you all deserve to

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.650
be sitting here, and you all
can pass this class and do

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.650
well in it, so we can help you
get there no matter what.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.080
You all absolutely
can do this.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.590
And then one more time, to
reiterate, in case anyone

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.990
missed it, 1 a, make sure you
understand that, I feel like

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.700
that's important.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.920
And actually all of 1 --

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.200
I really feel like the
photoelectric effect is

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.710
important for understanding all
of these energy concepts.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.380
So, as you go on in this class,
make sure you don't go

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.030
on before you go back
and make sure you

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.380
understand that problem.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.260
All right, so let's move on to
material for exam 2 now, and

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.550
we're already three lectures
into exam 2 material.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.370
And I do want to say that in
terms of 511-1, what tends to

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.140
happen is the exam scores go up
and up and up, in terms of

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.250
as we go from exam 1, to
exam 2, to exam 3.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.470
One of these reasons is we are
building on material, the

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.510
other reason is you'll be
shocked at how much better you

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.830
are at taking an exam just
a few weeks from now.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.660
So this will be on, starting
with the Lewis structures, so

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.300
go back in your notes -- if this
doesn't sound familiar,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.030
if you spent too much time -- or
not too much time, spent a

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.520
lot of time studying exam 1
and didn't move on here.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.400
Today we're going to talk about
the breakdown of the

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.550
octet rule.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.310
Cases where we don't have eight
electrons around our

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.600
Lewis structures, then
we'll move on to

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.260
talking about ionic bonds.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.590
We had already talked about
covalent bonds, and then we

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.060
talked about Lewis structures,
which describe the electron

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.060
configuration in
covalent bonds.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.160
So now let's think about the
other extreme of ionic bonds,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.390
and then we'll talk about polar
covalent bonds to end,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.670
if we get there or will start
with that in class on Monday.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.330
Also, public service
announcement for all of you,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.620
voter registration in
Massachusetts, which is where

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.620
we are, is on Monday, the
deadline if you want to

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.800
register to vote.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.750
There's some websites up there
that can guide you through

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.850
registering and also can guide
you through, if you need an

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.480
absentee ballot for
your home state.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.500
And I actually saw, and I saw
a 5.111 student manning,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.230
there's some booths around MIT
that will register you or get

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.790
you an absentee ballot.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.120
So, the deadline's coming soon,
so patriotic duty, I

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.580
need to remind you of that as
your chemistry teacher --

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.940
chemistry issues are important
in politics as well.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.540
So make sure you get
registered to vote.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.330
I just remembered one more
announcement, too, that I did

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.770
want to mention, some of you may
have friends in 511-2 and

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.610
have heard their class
average for exam 1.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.100
And I want to tell you, this
happens every year, their

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.040
average was 15 points higher
than our average.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.090
Last year, their average
was 15 points

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.140
higher than our average.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.690
This is for exam 1.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.660
This is what tends to happen
to 511-2 grades as

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.430
the exam goes on.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.800
This is what happens to 511-1.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.600
You guys are in a good spot.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.160
Also, I want to point out that
what's not important is just

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.610
that number grade, but also the
letter that goes with it.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.990
So, for example, if you got a 69
in this class on this exam,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.260
that's a B minus.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.870
If you got a 69 on your exam
in 511-2, that's a D, you

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.920
didn't pass the exam.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.970
So keep that in mind when your
friend might have gotten a

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.670
higher number grade than you
and you know you understand

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.490
the similar material
just as well.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.600
Similarly, an 80 in this class
on the exam was a B plus, a

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.790
very high B. An 80 in that class
is going to be a C. So,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.890
just don't worry so much about
exactly where that average

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.330
lies, you really want to
think about what the

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.510
letter grade means.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.290
OK, I've said enough.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.650
I just --

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.550
I hate to see people
discouraged, and I know that a

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.030
few people have been feeling
discouraged, so that's my

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.030
long-winded explanation
of exam 1 grades.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.390
All right.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.890
So, let's move on with life
though, so talking about the

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.070
breakdown of the octet rule.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.400
The first example where we're
going to see a breakdown is

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.470
any time we have an odd number
of valence electrons.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.900
This is probably the easiest to
explain and to think about,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.740
because if we have an odd number
that means that we

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.440
can't have our octet rule,
because our octet rule works

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.140
by pairing electrons.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.020
And if we have an odd number,
we automatically have an odd

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.440
electron out.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.560
So, if we look at an example,
the methyl radical, we can

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.120
first think about how we draw
the Lewis structure -- we draw

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.150
the skeletal structure here.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.900
And then what we're going to
do is add up our valence

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.580
electrons -- we have 3 times 1
for the hydrogen atoms, carbon

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.730
has 4 valence electrons, so
we have a total of 7.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.000
If we want to fill all of our
valence shells in each of

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.010
these atoms, we're going to need
a total of 14 electrons.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.770
So, what we see we're
left with is that we

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.340
have 7 bonding electrons.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.020
So we can fill in 6 of those
straightforward here, because

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.370
we know that we need to make
3 different bonds.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.670
And now we're left over
with 1 electron, we

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.890
can't make a bond.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.190
So, what we'll do is carbon does
not have an octet yet.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.195
We can't get it one, but we
can do the best we can and

00:13:27.195 --> 00:13:30.890
help it out with adding that
extra electron onto the carbon

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.420
atom, so that at least we're
getting as close as possible

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.380
to filling our octets.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.280
This is what we call a radical
species or a free radical.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.090
Free radical or radical species
is essentially any

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.580
type of a molecule that has this
unpaired electron on one

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.890
of the atoms. This might look
really strange, we're used to

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.180
seeing octets.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.630
But you'll realize, if you
calculate the formal charge on

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.470
this molecule, that
it's not the worst

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.190
situation ever for carbon.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.680
At least it's formal charge is
zero, even if it doesn't have

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.830
-- it would rather have
an extra bond

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.420
and have a full octet.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.120
But it's not the worst scenario
that we can imagine.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.170
But still, radicals tend to be
incredibly reactive because

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.030
they do want to fill
that octet.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.000
So, what happens when you have a
radical is it tends to react

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.640
with the first thing that it
runs into, especially highly

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.450
reactive radicals that are not
stabilized in some other way,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.030
which you'll tend to talk about
it organic chemistry --

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.510
how you can stabilize
radicals.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.330
So the term free radical should
sound familiar to you,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.390
whether you've heard it in
chemistry before, or you

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.330
haven't heard it in chemistry,
but maybe have heard it, I

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.710
don't know, commercials
for facial

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.150
products or other things.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.350
People like to talk about free
radicals, and they're sort of

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.680
the hero that gets rid of
free radicals, which are

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.320
antioxidants.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.450
So you hear in a lot of
different creams or products

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.120
or vitamins that they have
antioxidants in them, which

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.840
get rid of free radicals.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.010
The reason you would want to
get rid of free radicals is

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.630
that free radicals can
damage DNA, so

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.810
they're incredibly reactive.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.120
It makes sense that if they hit
a strand of DNA, they're

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.250
going to react with the DNA,
you end up breaking the

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.320
strands of DNA and causing
DNA damage.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.580
So, this is actually what
happens in aging because we

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.950
have a lot of free radicals
in our body.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.940
We can introduce them
artificially, for example,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.760
cigarette smoke has a lot of
really dangerous free radicals

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.000
that get into the cells in your
lungs, which damage your

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.280
lung DNA, which can
cause lung cancer.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.290
But also, all of us are living
and breathing, which means

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.250
we're having metabolism go on in
our body, which means that

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.550
as we use oxygen and as we
metabolize our food, we are

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.850
actually producing free
radicals as well.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.510
So it's kind of a paradox
because we need them because

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.780
they are a natural by-product of
these important processes,

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.070
but then they can go on and
damage cells, which is what

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.160
kind of is causing aging
and can lead to cancer.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.090
We have enzymes in our body
that repair damage that is

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.730
done by free radicals, that will
put the strands of DNA

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.710
back together.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.370
And we also have antioxidants
in our body.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.920
So, you might know that, for
example, very brightly colored

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.830
fruit is full of antioxidants,
they're full of chemicals that

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.880
will neutralize free radicals.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.850
Lots of vitamins are also
antioxidants, so we have

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.870
vitamin A on the top there
and vitamin E.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.980
So, the most common thing we
think of when we think of free

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.110
radicals is very reactive,
bad for your

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.250
body, causes DNA damage.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.530
But the reality is that
free radicals are also

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.990
essential for life.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.530
So this is kind of interesting
to think about.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.080
And, for example, certain
enzymes or proteins actually

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.950
use free radicals in order to
carry out the reactions that

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.540
they carry out in your body.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.280
So, for example, this is a
picture or a snapshot of a

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.350
protein, this is a crystal
structure of ribonucleotide

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.830
reductase is what it's called.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.100
It's an enzyme that catalyzes
the reaction of an essential

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.980
step in both DNA synthesis and
also DNA repair, and it

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.090
requires having radicals within
its active site in

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.830
order to carry out
the chemistry.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.910
So, this is kind of a neat
paradox, because radicals

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:13.350
damage DNA, but in order to
repair your DNA, you need

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.970
certain enzymes, and those
enzymes require different

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.610
types of free radicals.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.090
So, free radicals are definitely
very interesting,

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.720
and once we get -- or hopefully
you will get into

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.680
organic chemistry at some point
and get to really think

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.530
about what they do in terms
of a radical mechanism.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.120
We can think about radicals that
are also more stable, so

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.690
let's do another example with
the molecule nitric acid.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.220
So we can again, draw the
skeleton here, and just by

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.510
looking at it we might not know
it's a radical, but as we

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.190
start to count valence
electrons, we should be able

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.790
to figure it out very quickly,
because what we have is 11

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.350
valence electrons.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.630
We need 16 electrons to
have full octets.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.270
So, we're left with 5
bonding electrons.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.760
We put a double bond in between
our nitrogen and our

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.840
oxygen, so what we're left
over with is this single

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.830
bonding electron, and we'll put
that on the nitrogen here.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.140
And I'll explain why we put it
on the nitrogen and not the

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.080
oxygen in just a minute.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.350
But what we find is then once
we fill in the rest of the

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.480
valence electrons in terms of
lone pairs, this is the

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.460
structure that we get.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.340
And if you add up all of the
formal charges on the nitrogen

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.450
and on the oxygen, what you'll
see is they're both 0.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.600
So if you happen to try drawing
this structure and you

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.710
put the lone pair on oxygen and
then you figured out the

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.900
formal charge and saw that you
had a split charge, a plus 1

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.440
and a minus 1, the first thing
you might want to try is

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.430
putting it on the other atom,
and once you did that you'd

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.990
see that you had a
better structure

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.500
with no formal charge.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.300
I have to mention what nitric
oxide does, because it's a

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.850
very interesting molecule.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.670
Don't get it confused with
nitrous oxide, which is happy

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.880
gas, that's n o 2.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.880
This is nitric oxide, and it's
actually much more interesting

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.430
than nitrous oxide.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.690
It's a signaling molecule in
your body, it's one of the

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.050
very few signaling molecules
that is a gas, and obviously,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.440
it's also a radical.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.350
What happens with n o is that
it's produced in the

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.210
endothelium of your blood
vessels, so the inner lining

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.280
of your blood vessels, and it
signals for smooth muscle that

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.180
line your blood vessels
to relax, which causes

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.900
vasodilation , and by
vasodilation, I just mean a

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.850
widening of the blood vessels.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.320
So, n o signals for your blood
vessels to get wider and allow

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.070
more blood to flow through.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.860
And if you think about what
consequences this could have,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.320
in terms of places where they
have high altitude, so they

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.080
have lower oxygen levels, do
you think that they produce

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.440
more or less and
n o their body?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.030
More?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.750
Yeah, it turns out they
do produce more.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.810
The reason they produce more is
that they want to have more

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.340
blood flowing through their
veins so that they can get

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.060
more oxygenated blood into
different parts of their body.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.770
N o is also a target in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.260
A very famous one that became
famous I guess over 10 years

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.700
ago now, and this is from a drug
that actually targets one

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.440
of n o's receptors, and this
drug has the net effect of

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.190
vasodilation or widening of
blood vessels in a certain

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.650
area in the body.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.880
So this is viagra, some of you
may be familiar, I think

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.880
everyone's heard of viagra.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.370
Now you know how viagra works.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.770
Viagra breaks down, or it
inhibits the breakdown of n

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.010
o's binding partner in just
certain areas, not everywhere

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.910
in your body.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.060
So, in those areas, what happens
is you get more n o

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.330
signaling, you get more
vasodilation, you get

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.220
increased blood flow.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.770
So that's a little bit
of pharmacology

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.750
for you here today.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.480
All right, so let's talk about
one more example in terms of

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.990
the breakdown of the octet
rule with radicals.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.230
Let's think about molecular
oxygen.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.970
So let's go ahead and quickly
draw this Lewis structure.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.840
We have o 2.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.130
The second thing we
need to do is

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.900
figure out valence electrons.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.060
6 plus 6, so we would
expect to see 12.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:17.850
For a complete octet we would
need 8 electrons each, so 16.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:25.250
So in terms of bonding
electrons, what we have is 4

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.190
bonding electrons.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.890
So, we can go ahead and fill
those in as a double bond

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.200
between the two oxygens.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.140
So, what we end up having left,
and this would be step

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.820
six then because five was just
filling in that, is 12 minus

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.890
4, so we have 8 lone pair
electrons left.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:51.290
So we can just fill it in to
our oxygens like this.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.970
All right, so using everything
we've learned about Lewis

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.730
structures, we here have the
structure of molecular oxygen.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.100
And I just want to point out for
anyone that gets confused,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.500
when we talk about oxygen as
an atom, that's o, but

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.240
molecular oxygen is actually
o 2, the same for molecular

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.960
hydrogen, for example.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.430
All right, so let's look at
what the actual Lewis

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.780
structure is for molecular
oxygen, and it turns out that

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.030
actually we don't have a double
bond, we have a single

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.030
bond, and we have
two radicals.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.820
And any time we have two
radicals, we talk about what's

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.220
called a biradical.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.480
And while using this exception
to the Lewis structure rule,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.390
to the octet rule for odd
numbers of valence electrons

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.020
can clue us into the fact that
we have a radical, there's

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.220
really no way for us to use
Lewis structures to predict

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.970
when we have a biradical, right,
because we would just

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.660
predict that we would get this
Lewis structure here.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.270
So, when I first introduced
Lewis structures, I said these

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.790
are great, they're really easy
to use and they work about 90%

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.080
of the time.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.750
This falls into that 10%
that Lewis structures

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.930
don't work for us.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.260
It turns out, in order to
understand that this is the

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.950
electron configuration for o
2, we need to use something

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.870
called molecular orbital theory,
and just wait till

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.190
next Wednesday and we will tell
you what that is, and we

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.970
will, in fact, use
it for oxygen.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.650
But until that point, I'll just
tell you that molecular

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.150
orbital theory takes into
account quantum mechanics,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.060
which Lewis theory does not.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.950
So that's why, in fact, there
are those 10% of cases that

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.960
Lewis structures
don't work for.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.850
All right, the second case of
exceptions to the octet rule

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.530
are when we have octet
deficient molecules.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.570
So basically, this means we're
going to have a molecule

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.530
that's stable, even though it
doesn't have a complete octet.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.450
And these tend to happen in
group 13 molecules, and

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.790
actually happen almost
exclusively in group 13

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.210
molecules, specifically with
boron and aluminum.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.010
So, any time you see a Lewis
structure with boron or

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.760
aluminum, you want to just
remember that I should look

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.080
out to make sure that these
might have an incomplete

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.070
octet, so look out for that
when you see those atoms.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.910
So, let's look at b f 3
as our example here.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.290
And what we see for b f 3
is the number of valence

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.420
electrons that we have are 24,
because the valence number of

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.330
electrons for boron
is 3, and then 3

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.910
times 7 for each fluorine.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.070
For total filled octets we need
32, so that means we need

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.420
8 bonding electrons.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.920
So, let's assign two to each
bond here, and then we're

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.160
going to have two extra bonding
electrons, so let's

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.350
just arbitrarily pick
a fluorine to give

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.850
a double bond to.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.340
And then we can fill in the lone
pair electrons, we have

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.250
16 left over.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.660
So thinking about what the
formal charge is, if we want

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.470
to figure out the formal charge
for the boron here,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.590
what we're talking about is the
valence number for boron,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.430
which is 3, minus 0 because
there are no lone pairs, minus

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.450
1/2 of 8 because there are
eight shared electrons.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.520
We get a formal charge
of minus 1.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.380
What is our formal charge
since we learned this on

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.250
Monday for thinking
about the double

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.770
bonded fluorine in boron?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.280
So, look at your notes and look
at the fluorine that has

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.940
a double bond with it, and I
want you to go ahead and tell

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:32.030
me what that formal
charge should be.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:46.650
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on that.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.400
OK, so 49%.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.800
So, let's go look back at the
notes, we'll talk about why

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.610
about 50% of you are right, and
50% need to review, which

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.880
I totally understand you haven't
had time to do yet,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.190
your formal charge rules from
Monday's class, there were

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.520
other things going on.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.490
But let's talk about how we
figure out formal charge.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.390
Formal charge is just the number
of valence electrons

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.720
you have. So fluorine has 7.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.140
You should be able to look at a
periodic table and see that

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.550
fluorine has seven.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.760
What we subtract from that is
the number of lone pair

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.280
electrons, and there are four
lone pair electrons on this

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.770
double bonded fluorine,
so it's minus 4.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.150
Then we subtract 1/2 of
the shared electrons.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.870
Well we have a double bond with
boron here, so we have a

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.050
total of 4 shared electrons.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.350
And when we do the subtraction
here, what we end up with is a

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:46.180
formal charge plus 1 on the
double bonded fluorine.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.580
Without even doing a
calculation, what do you think

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.540
that the formal charge
should be on you

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.940
single bonded fluorines?

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.400
Good.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.700
OK, it should be
0 and it is 0.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.420
The reason it's zero in terms of
calculating it is 7 minus 6

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.150
lone pair electrons minus
1/2 half of 2 shared

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.840
electrons is 0.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.140
The reason that you all told
me, I think, and I hope, is

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.890
that you know that the formal
charge on individual atoms has

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.120
to equal the total charge
on the molecule.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.030
So if we already have a minus 1
and a plus 1, and we know we

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.740
have no charge in the molecule,
and we only have one

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.640
type of atom left to talk about,
that formal charge had

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.240
better be 0.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.690
OK.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.940
So this looks pretty good in
terms of a Lewis structure, we

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.760
figured out our formal
charges.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.080
These also look pretty good,
too, we don't have too much

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.800
charge separation.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.640
But what actually it turns out
is that if you experimentally

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.060
look at what type of bonds you
have, it turns out that all

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.840
three of the b f bonds are equal
in length, and they all

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.160
have a length that would
correspond to a single bond.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.790
So, experimentally, we know we
have to throw out this Lewis

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.430
structure here, we have some
more information, let's think

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.430
about how this could happen.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.330
So this could happen, for
example, is if we take this

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.490
two of the electrons that are in
the b f double bond and we

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.810
put it right on to the fluorine
here, so now we have

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.280
all single bonds.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.630
And let's think about what the
formal charge situation would

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.970
be in this case here.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.990
What happens here is now we
would have a formal charge of

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.770
0 on the boron, we'd have a
formal charge of 0 on all of

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.760
the fluorine molecules
as well.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.480
So, it turns out that actually
looking at formal charge, even

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.220
though the first case didn't
look too bad, this case

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.970
actually looks a lot better.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.320
We have absolutely no formal
charge separation whatsoever.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.390
It turns out again, boron and
aluminum, those are the two

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.890
that you want to look out for.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.970
They can be perfectly happy
without a full octet, they're

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.510
perfectly happy with 6 instead
of 8 in terms of electrons in

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.410
their valence shell.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.650
So that is our exception
the number two.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.230
We have one more exception and
this is a valence shell

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.950
expansion, and this can be the
hardest to look out for,

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.770
students tend to forget to look
for this one, but it's

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.860
very important as well, because
there are a lot of

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.610
structures that are affected
for this .

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.660
And this is only applicable if
we're talking about a central

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.520
atom that has an n value or
a principle quantum number

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.420
that's equal to or greater
than three.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.110
What happens when we have n
that's equal to or greater to

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.790
three, is that now, in addition
to s orbitals and p

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.090
orbitals, what else do we
have available to us?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.350
D orbitals, great.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.470
So what we see is we have some
empty d orbitals, which means

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.310
that we can have more than
eight electrons that fit

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.400
around that central atom.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.380
If you're looking to see if this
is going to happen, do

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.020
you think this would happen
with a large or

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.350
small central atom?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.430
So think of it in terms
of just fitting.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.320
We've got to fit more than
8 electrons around here.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.860
Yeah, so it's going to be, we
need to have a large central

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.050
atom in order for this
to take place.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.470
Literally, we just need to fit
everything around is probably

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.050
the easiest way to
think about it.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.160
And what happens is it also
tends to have small atoms that

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.860
it's bonded to.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.900
Again, just think of it in terms
of all fitting in there.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.160
So, let's take an
example p c l 5.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.660
The first example is the more
straightforward example,

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.240
because let's start to draw the
Lewis structure, and what

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.250
we see is that phosphorous has
five chlorines around it.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.980
So we already know if we want
to form five bonds we've

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.120
broken our octet rule.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.570
But let's go through and figure
this out and see how

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.660
that happens.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.900
What we know is we need
40 valence electrons,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.090
we have those --

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.410
5 from the phosphorous, and
we have 7 from each of the

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.190
chlorine atoms. If we were to
fill out all of those octets,

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.850
that would be 48 electrons.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.710
So what we end up with when
we do our Lewis structure

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.270
calculation is that we only
have 8 bonding electrons

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.560
available to us.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.270
So we can fill those in between
the phosphorous and

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.240
the chlorine, those 8
bonding electrons.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.000
So, this is obviously
a problem.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.080
To make 5 p c l bonds we need
10 shared electrons, and we

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.990
know that that's the situation
because it's called p c l 5

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.530
and not p c l 4, so we can go
right ahead and add in that

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.220
extra electron pair.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.350
So we've used up 10 for bonding,
so that means what we

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.740
have left is 30 lone pair
electrons, and I would not

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.120
recommend filling all of these
in your notes right now, you

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.500
can go back and do that, but
just know the rest end up

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.300
filling up the octets for
all of the chlorines.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.450
So, in this first case where you
actually need to make more

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.170
than for bonds, you will
immediately know you need to

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.240
use this exception to the Lewis
structure octet rule,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.130
but sometimes it won't
be as obvious.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.090
So, let's look at c r o 4, the
2 minus version here, so a

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.530
chromate ion, and if we draw
the skeletal structure, we

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.940
have four things that the
chromate needs to bond to.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.200
So, let's do the Lewis
structure again.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.320
When we figure out the valence
electrons, we have total, we

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.760
have 6 from the chromium, we
have 6 from each of the

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.450
different oxygens, and where
did this 2 come from?

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.780
Yup, the negative charge.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.600
So, remember, we have 2 extra
electrons hanging out in our

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.520
molecule, so we need
to include those.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.670
We have a total of 32.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.870
40 are needed to
fill up octets.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.820
So again, we have 8 bonding
electrons available, so we can

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.560
go ahead and fill these in
between each of the bonds.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.850
What happens is that we then
have 24 lone pair electrons

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.810
left, and we can fill
those in like this.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.350
And the problem comes
now when we figure

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.810
out the formal charge.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.310
So, when we do that what we find
is that the chromium has

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.510
a formal charge of plus 1, and
that each of the oxygens has a

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.040
total charge of minus 1.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.240
So we actually have a bit of
charge separation here.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.560
Without even doing a
calculation, what is the total

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.420
charge of these that
are added up?

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.140
OK, it's minus 2,
that's right.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.850
We know that the total charge of
each of the formal charges

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.290
has to add up to minus 2,
because that's the charge in

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.210
our molecule.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.130
We can also just calculate it
-- the chromate gives us a

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.030
plus 2, then we have 4 times
minus 1 for each of the

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.600
oxygens, so we have a minus 2.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.950
So, we have some charge
separation here, and in some

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.380
cases, if we're not at n equals
3 or higher, there's

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.470
really nothing we can do about
it, this would be the best

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.580
structure we can do.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.530
But since we have these d
orbitals available, we can use

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.100
them, and it turns out that
experimentally this is what's

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.180
found, that the length and the
strength are not single bonds,

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.855
but they're actually something
between a single bond and a

00:33:32.855 --> 00:33:33.970
double bond.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.220
So how do we get a 1 and 1/2
bond, for example, what's the

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.710
term that let's us do that?

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.360
Resonance.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:40.920
That's right.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.130
So that's exactly what's
happening here.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.160
So, if we went ahead and drew
this structure here where we

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.230
have now two double bonds and
two single bonds, that would

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.920
be in resonance with another
structure where we have two

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.220
double bonds instead to these
two oxygens, and now, single

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.020
bonds to these two oxygens.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.810
We can actually also have
several other resonance

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.140
structures as well.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.500
Remember, the definition of a
resonance structure is where

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.470
all the atoms stay the same,
but what we can do is move

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:11.830
around the electrons -- we're
moving around those extra two

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.280
electrons that can be
in double bonds.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.140
So, why don't you tell me
how many other resonance

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:27.170
structures you would expect to
see for this chromate ion?

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:50.960
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on this.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.640
All right.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.260
This is good.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.980
I know this is a real split
response, but the right answer

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.360
is the one that is indicated
in the graph

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.930
here that it's four.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.380
This takes a little bit of time
to get used to thinking

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.890
about all the different Lewis
structures you can have. So,

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.990
you guys should all go back
home if you can't see it

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.330
immediately right now and try
drawing out those four other

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.360
Lewis structures, for chromate,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.700
there are four others.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.240
You'll probably get a chance to
literally do this example

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.420
in recitation where you draw
out all four, but it's even

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.500
better to make sure you
understand it before you get

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.450
to that point.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.800
So, we can go back to
the class notes.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.280
So it turns out there's four
other Lewis structures, so

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.410
basically just think about
all the other different

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.910
combinations where you can have
single and double bonds,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.350
and when you draw those out,
you end up with four.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.730
So, for every single one of
these Lewis structures, we

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.680
could figure out what the formal
charges are, and what

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.600
we would find is that it's 0
on the chromium, it's 0 for

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.630
the double bonded oxygens, and
it's going to be negative 1

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.320
for the single bonded oxygens.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.050
So, what you can see is that in
this situation, we end up

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.310
having less formal charge
separation, and that's what

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.180
we're looking for, that's the
more stable structure.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.570
So any time you can have an
expanded octet -- an expanded

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.940
valence shell, where you have n
is equal to or greater than

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.510
3, and by expanding and adding
more electrons into that

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.380
valence shell, you lower
the charge separation,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.560
you want to do that.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.000
I also want to point out, I
basically said there's 6

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.600
different ways we can draw this
in terms of drawing all

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.880
the resonance structures.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.340
You might be wondering if you
have to figure out the formal

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.810
charge for each structure
individually, and the answer

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.560
is no, you can pick any single
structure and the formal

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.360
charges will work
out the same.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.900
So, for example, if you pick
this structure and your friend

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.590
picks this structure, you'll
both get the right answer that

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.930
there's just the negative 1 on
the oxygens and no other

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.130
formal charges in the molecule.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.480
All right.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.880
So those are the end of our
exceptions to the octet rule

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.080
for Lewis structures, that's
everything we're going to say

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.670
about Lewis structures.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.040
And remember, that when we talk
about Lewis structures,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.140
what they tell us is the
electron configuration in

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.520
covalent bonds, so that
valence shell electron

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.740
configuration.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.100
So we talked a lot about
covalent bonds before we got

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.290
into Lewis structures, and then
how to represent covalent

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.490
bonds by Lewis structures.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.730
So now I'll say a little bit
about ionic bonds, which are

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.080
the other extreme, and when you
have an ionic bond, what

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.420
you have now is a complete
transfer of either one or many

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.370
electrons between two atoms. So
the key word for covalent

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.440
bond was electron sharing, the
key word for ionic bonds is

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.660
electron transfer.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.700
And the bonding between the two
atoms ends up resulting

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.700
from an attraction that we're
very familiar with, which is

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.130
the Coulomb or the electrostatic
attraction

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.930
between the negatively
charged and the

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:41.610
positively charged ions.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:42.690
So let's take an example.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.940
The easiest one to think about
is where we have a negative 1

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.360
and a positive 1 ion.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.460
So this is salt, n a c l --
actually lots of things are

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.610
call salt, but this is what
we think of a table salt.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.970
So, let's think about what we
have to do if we want the form

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.690
sodium chloride from the neutral
sodium and chlorine

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.570
atoms. So, the first thing that
we're going to need to do

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:08.540
is we need to convert sodium
into sodium plus.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.610
What does this process
look like to you?

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.470
Is this one of those periodic
trends, perhaps?

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.150
Can anyone name what we're
looking at here?

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.930
Exactly, ionization energy.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.050
So, if we're going to talk about
the energy difference

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.420
here, what we're going to
be talking about is the

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.150
ionization energy, or the energy
it takes to rip off an

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.370
electron from sodium in order
to form the sodium plus ion.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.080
So, we can just put right
here, that's 494

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.200
kilojoules per mole.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.880
The next thing that we want to
look at is chlorine, so in

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.680
terms of chlorine we need to
go to chlorine minus, so we

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.860
actually need to add
an electron.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.370
This is actually the reverse of
one of the periodic trends

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.120
we talked about.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.160
Which trend is that this
is the reverse of?

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.500
Electron affinity, right.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.330
Because if we go backwards we're
saying how badly does

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.310
chlorine want to grab
an electron?

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.360
Chlorine wants to do this very
badly, and it turns out the

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.060
electron affinity for chlorine
is huge, it's 349 kilojoules

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.790
per mole, but remember, we're
going in reverse, so we need

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.820
to talk about it as negative
349 kilojoules per mole.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.060
So if we talk about the sum of
what's happening here, what we

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.480
need to do is think about going
from the neutrals to the

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.420
ions, so we can just add those
two energies together, and

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.690
what we end up with is plus 145
kilojoules per mole, in

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.590
order to go from neutral
sodium in

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.350
chlorine to the ions.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.440
So, the problem here is that we
have to actually put energy

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.730
into our system, so this doesn't
seem favorable, right.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.200
What's favorable is when we
actually get energy out and

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.420
our energy gets lower, but what
we're saying here is that

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.850
we actually need to
put in energy.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.720
So another way to say
this is this process

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.820
actually requires energy.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.290
It does not emit energy, it
does not give off excess

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.340
energy, it requires energy.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.230
So, we need to think about how
can we solve this problem in

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.240
terms of thinking about ionic
bonds, and the answer is

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.590
Coulomb attraction.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.460
So there's one more force that
we need to talk about, and

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.160
that is when we talk about the
attraction between the

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.520
negatively and the positively
charged ions, such that we

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.150
form sodium chloride.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.900
So this process here has a
delta energy, a change in

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.570
energy of negative 589
kilojoules per mole.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.230
So that's huge, we're giving
off a lot of energy by this

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.140
attraction.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.820
So if we add up the net energy
for all of this process, all

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.220
we need to do is add negative
589 to plus 145.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.480
So what we end up getting is the
net energy change is going

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.700
to be negative 444 kilojoules
per mole, so you can see that,

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.490
in fact, it is very favorable
for neutral sodium and neutral

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:53.090
chloride to form sodium chloride
in an ionic bond.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.680
And the net increase then,
is a decrease in energy.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.880
So, I just gave you the number
in terms of what that Coulomb

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.710
potential would be in
attraction, but we can I

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.480
easily calculate it as well
using this equation here where

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.440
the energy is equal to the
charge on each of the ions,

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.070
and this is just multiplied by
the value of charge for an

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:17.880
electron divided by 4 pi epsilon
nought times r, are r

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.420
is just the distance in terms
of the bond length we could

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.330
talk about.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.790
So, let's calculate and make
sure that I didn't tell you a

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:25.690
false number here.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.440
Let's say we do the calculation
with the bond

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.460
length that we've looked
up, which is 2 .

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.040
3 6 angstroms for
the bond length

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.520
between sodium and chloride.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.230
So we should be able to figure
out the Coulombic

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.710
attraction for this.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:47.540
So, if we talk about the energy
of attraction, we need

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.140
to multiply plus 1, that's the
charge on the sodium, times

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.370
minus 1, the charge on the
chlorine, times the charge in

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.030
an electron, 1 .

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:04.640
6 0 2 times 10 the negative 19
Coulombs, and that's all

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:12.470
divided by 4 pi, and then I've
written out epsilon nought in

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.610
your notes, so I won't write
it on the board.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.910
And then r, so r is
going to be 2 .

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:23.170
3 6 and times -- what is
angstrom, everyone?

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.080
Yup, 10 to the negative 10.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.190
So 10 to the negative
10 meters.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:34.780
So, if we do this calculation
here, what we end up with is

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:42.770
negative 9.774 times 10 to
the negative 19 joules.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.310
So that's what we have in
terms of our energy.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.330
That does not look the same as
what we saw -- yup, do you

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:49.910
have a question?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:54.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.770
Luckily, although, I did not
write it in my own notes, I

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.090
did it when I put in my
calculator, thank you.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.040
So you need to square this value
here and then you should

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.600
get this value right here,
negative 9.77.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.320
All right, so what we need to
do though is convert from

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.560
joules into kilojoules per mole,
because that's what we

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.650
were using.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:20.580
So if we multiply that number
there by kilojoules per mole

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.540
-- or excuse me, first
kilojoules per joule, so we

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.430
have 1,000 joules in
every kilojoule.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.830
And then we multiply that by
Avagadro's number, 6.022 times

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:40.490
10 to the 23 per mole.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.770
What we end up with
is negative 589

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.090
kilojoules per mole.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.570
So this is that same Coulombic
attraction that we saw in the

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.290
first place.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:57.100
So, notice that you will
naturally get out a negative

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.760
charge here, remember negative
means an attractive force in

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.450
this case, because you
have the plus and

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.390
the minus 1 in here.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.630
So we should be able to easily
do that calculation, and what

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.060
we end up getting matches up
with what I just told you,

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.470
luckily, and thank you for
catching the square, that's an

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.070
important part in getting
the right answer.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:21.120
So, experimentally then, what we
find is that the change in

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.070
energy for this reaction
is negative 444

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.850
kilojoules per mole.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.980
If we look experimentally what
we see, it's actually a little

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.800
bit different, it's negative
411 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.530
So, in terms of this class, this
is the method that we're

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.470
going to use, and we're going
to say this gets us close

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:41.070
enough such that we can make
comparisons and have a

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.870
meaningful conversations about
different types of ionic bonds

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.070
and the attraction
between them.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.500
But let's think about where this
discrepancy comes from,

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.710
and before I do that I want to
point out, one term we use a

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:57.190
lot is change in energy for a
reaction where, for example,

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.640
you break a bond.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.520
Remember that the negative of
the change in energy is what's

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.570
called delta e sub d.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.630
We first saw this when we first
introduced the idea of

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.330
covalent bonds.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:14.600
Do you remember what this term
here means, delta e sub d?

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.750
A little bit and some no's,
which this was pre-exam, I

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.550
understand, you still need to
review those notes, it's

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.320
dissociation energy.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.950
So you get a negative energy
out by breaking the bond.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.360
The dissociation energy means
how much energy that bond is

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.870
worth in terms of strength, so
it's the opposite of the

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.350
energy you get out of breaking
the bond -- or excuse me, the

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.680
energy that you get out
of forming the bond.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.090
It's the amount of energy you
need to put in to break the

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.620
bond is dissociation energy.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.470
It takes this much energy
to dissociate your

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.860
bond, excuse me.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:45.230
All right.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.670
So, let's take a look here at
our predictions, so I just put

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.070
them both ways so we
don't get confused.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.730
The dissociation
energy is 444.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.570
The change in energy
for forming the

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.630
bond is negative 444.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.220
We made the following
approximations, which explain

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.350
why, in fact, we got a different
experimental energy,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:04.540
if we look at that.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.060
The first thing is that we
ignored any repulsive

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:07.730
interactions.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.220
If you think about salt, it's
not just two single atoms that

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.390
you are talking about.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.090
It's actually in a whole network
or whole lattice of

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.920
other molecules, so you actually
have some other

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.730
chlorines around that are going
to be having repulsive

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.310
interactions with our chlorine
that we're talking about.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.630
We're going to ignore those,
make the approximation that

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.840
those don't matter, at this
point, in these calculations.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.370
And the result for that is that
we end up with a larger

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.670
dissociation energy than
the experimental value.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.750
That's because the bond is going
to be a little bit more

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.780
broken than it was in our
calculation, because we do

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.870
have these repulsive
interactions.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.040
The other thing that we did is
that we treated both sodium

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.250
and the chlorine as
point charges.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.380
And this is what actually
allowed us to make this

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.290
calculation and calculate the
Coulomb potential so easily,

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.320
we just treated them as if
they're point charges.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.270
We're ignoring quantum mechanics
in this -- this is

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:04.020
sort of the class where we
ignore quantum mechanics, we

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.550
ignored it for Lewis
structures,

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.730
we're ignoring it here.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.170
We will be back to paying a lot
of attention to quantum

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.630
mechanics in lecture 14 when we
talk about MO theory, but

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.560
for now, these are
approximations, these are

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.220
models where we don't take
it into consideration.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.010
And I think you'll agree that we
come reasonably close such

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.360
that we'll be able to make
comparisons between different

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.580
kinds of ionic bonds.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.050
All right.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.690
So, the last thing I want to
introduce today is talking

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.840
about polar covalent bonds.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.150
We've now covered the
two extremes.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.070
One extreme is complete total
electron sharing -- if we have

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:41.560
a perfectly covalent bond,
we have perfect sharing.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.870
The other is electron transfer
in terms of ionic bonds.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:49.340
So when we talk about a polar
covalent bond, what we're now

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.010
talking about is an unequal
sharing of electrons between

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.100
two atoms.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.450
So, this is essentially
something we've seen before,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.350
we just never formally talked
about what we would call it.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.830
This is any time you have a
bond forming between two

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.340
non-metals that have different
electronegativities, so, for

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.200
example, hydrogen
choride, h c l.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.880
The electronegativity for
hydrogen is 2.2, for

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.940
chlorine it's 3.2.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.120
And in general, what we say is
we consider a difference in

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.330
terms of a first approximation
if the difference in

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.280
electronegativity
is more than 0.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.560
5, so this is on the Pauling
electronegativity scale.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.850
So what we end up having is we
sort of have a kind of, and

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.840
what we call it is a partial
negative charge on the

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.220
chlorine, and a partial
positive

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.720
charge in the hydrogen.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.150
The reason we have that is
because the chlorine's more

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.970
electronegative, it wants to
pull more of that shared

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.770
electron density to itself.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.900
If it has more electron density,
it's going to have a

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.350
little bit of a negative charge
and the hydrogen's

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.150
going to be left with a little
bit of a positive charge.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:56.420
So, we can compare this, for
example to, molecular hydrogen

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.940
where they're going to have
that complete sharing, so

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.380
there's not going to be a delta
plus or a delta minus,

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.300
delta is going to be equal to
zero on each of the atoms.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.670
They are completely sharing
their electrons.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.000
And we can also explain this
in another way by talking

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.670
about a dipole moment where we
have a charged distribution

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.340
that results in this dipole,
this electric dipole.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.540
And we talk about this using
the term mu, which is a

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.290
measurement of what
the dipole is.

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.610
A dipole is always written in
terms of writing an arrow from

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.040
the positive charge to
the negative charge.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.780
In chemistry, we are always
incredibly interested in what

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.900
the electrons are doing, so we
tend to pay attention to them

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.900
in terms of arrows.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.500
Oh, the electrons are going over
to the chlorine, so we're

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.290
going to draw our arrow toward
the chlorine atom.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:47.530
So, we measure this here, so mu
is equal to q times r, the

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.040
distance between the two.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.960
And q, that charge is just equal
to the partial negative

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.460
or the partial positive times
the charge on the electron.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.540
So this is measured in Coulomb
meters, you won't ever see a

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.990
measurement of electronegativity
in Coulomb

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.700
meters -- we tend to talk about
it in terms of debye or

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:12.310
1 d, or sometimes there's no
units at all, so the d is just

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.970
assumed, and it's because 1
debye is just equal to this

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.770
very tiny number of Coulomb
meters and it's a lot easier

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.850
to work with debye's here.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.470
So, when we talk about polar
molecules, we can actually

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:29.040
extend our idea of talking about
polar bonds to talking

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.170
about polar molecules.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.860
So, actually let's start
with that on Monday.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.380
So everyone have a
great weekend.

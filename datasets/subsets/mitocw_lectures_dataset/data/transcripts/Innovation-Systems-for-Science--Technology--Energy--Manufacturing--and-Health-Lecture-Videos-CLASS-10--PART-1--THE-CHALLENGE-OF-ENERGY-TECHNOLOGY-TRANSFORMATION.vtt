00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:24.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me quick
do a wrap-up of where we are,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.370
just so you remember
our context.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.080
Class one was really
all about growth.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.760
Economics, as you
all know, when we

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.870
talked about the contributions
that Solow and Romer made,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.580
and they really forced us to
look at what we could call

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.520
two direct innovation factors.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.350
What Solow called
technological-related

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.420
innovation we can
sort of translate that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.820
as R&D. And Romer, the talent
base human capital engagement

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.040
research was his key term.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.030
We read Dale Jorgensen,
and Jorgensen showed us

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.160
that technology-based
innovation really

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.190
was the driving causative
factor in the great growth

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.379
spurt of the 1990s.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.050
That was the innovation wave
around the IT revolution,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.460
as you remember.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.040
And we talked about how there
were direct innovation factors.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.970
So Romer contributed those,
arguably, and others.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.560
But there are also
many indirect factors.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.060
All right?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.755
So less critical
factors, but this

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:24.310
is a complex ecosystem
of innovation.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.340
Richard Nelson gives us a third
innovation factor, looking

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.870
at innovation as a system and
the organizational elements

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.240
within it and the connectedness
of the different actors

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.948
and the strength of
the different actors,

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.330
so that gives us a systems'
way of evaluating an innovation

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.000
system, whether it's national
or regional or local.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.130
Nelson gives us a perspective
on how to look at that system.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.580
Atkinson and others contributed
on innovation wave theory.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.560
The way in which
economies grow is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.180
that they bring these new
innovation waves on and scale

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.919
them up over an
extended period of time.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.880
They start very gradually,
finally reach a point

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.120
where they can scale quickly.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.805
There's always a bust, then
they scale more gradually.

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:17.680
That's kind of the stages
we've talked about.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.560
We're now with
the IT revolution.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.120
Charles Schulz
taught us to kind of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.390
be aware of industrial policy.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.270
And we talked a lot about
the government role here,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.170
but that's a cautionary tale
of some problematic aspects

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.940
of a governmental role.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.730
Classes 3 and 4 were really
about advanced manufacturing,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.040
which we did as our
first big case study.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.610
Obviously we'll have another
big case study today.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.950
We had health last week.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.560
Class 5 was on
innovation organization,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.600
and we talked about
the different models

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.840
that kind of govern the ideology
of innovation in this country.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.850
The associationalist
model, which

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.150
we could call the public-private
partnership kind of model.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.263
The conservative model, which
is governmental intervention.

00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:11.180
Government should stay
away from intervention,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.090
including into the
innovation system

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.730
except at the most
basic kind of levels

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.410
versus a national security model
which justifies intervention

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.030
at any stage if the need is
related to national security.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.085
And these debates go on.

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:28.460
There's a couple
of other models,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.877
but those are the
ones that really

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.040
represent the core
debates that still go on.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.650
We talked about the importance
of looking at innovation

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.560
from both the institutional
and the personal level.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.830
So people innovate,
institutions don't.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.870
You need to understand how
the institutions interact.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.490
But in the end, people
own particular innovations

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.500
and bring them about.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.083
So you've got to
understand innovation

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:53.440
at that personal level, as well.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.440
We talked about Donald
Stokes and a core issue

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.530
in the US system, its
disconnected model.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.620
The fact that we tend to
focus on early stage research

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.660
and have less focus
on the implementation

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.490
stages further along.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.850
And that creates a significant
tech transition problem

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.340
in the US system.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.529
Class 6 was about that how
to get across this, quote,

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.709
"Valley of Death," which
has been the major policy

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.010
preoccupation of US
science and technology

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.590
policy for the
last say 25 years.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.150
And in contrast we read
Vernon Ruttan, another growth

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.290
economist, who taught
us that, by the way,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.680
there's a whole parallel
system out there,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.370
there's a parallel universe
in the way in which the US R&D

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.370
systems are organized.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.350
There's a highly connected
defense information system

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.180
that's very different than
the somewhat disconnected

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.760
civilian side R&D system.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.050
Class 7 was great group theory,
what does innovation look

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.720
like at the face to face level?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.690
Innovation, again, is people,
it's not institutions.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.550
And what are the
rules sets that tend

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.940
to govern the way in which
teams and groups of people

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.100
working on complex innovations.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.120
How they come together?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.140
How do they assemble?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.190
How do they organize?

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.230
What are their rules?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.770
So that's all about a
third direct innovation

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.880
factor, innovation organization,
at both face to face

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.780
and institutional levels.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.750
Class 8 was around DARPA
as a very different kind

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.530
of model that attempts to
do both a connected model

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.540
and innovation through
a connected model

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.610
at the institutional
level, but it also

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.040
operates in creating great
groups in a very conscious kind

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.540
of way.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.290
And we explored the whole idea--

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.490
revolution role
that DARPA played.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.750
Class 9 last week was
really about the challenges

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.510
in the health innovation system.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.790
It's a early stage research,
basic research focused system.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.750
It's a quite disconnected model,
big organizational challenges

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.150
through the 27
different institutes

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.500
and centers at the National
Institutes of Health.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.350
Getting cross-cutting science
going between those institutes

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.840
is hard.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.840
Yet we're now at a stage where a
new revolution is coming along,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.350
which some termed the
convergence revolution.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.528
That's going to mandate much
more cross-cutting science,

00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:31.570
and yet we've got an
institutional organizational

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.300
problem that's not
adapted to handling

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.620
the kind of next generation
breakthrough territories.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.060
And now, energy.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.840
So we're going to really bring
to bear here the legacy sector

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.680
analysis model that we've been
touching on at several points.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.660
But today it really
comes into focus.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.960
Obviously, we touched on it last
week in the context of the NIH,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.450
but it really
comes to bear here.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.900
And the issue of innovating
in complex established sectors

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.300
is a big problem for the US.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.730
It's a problem for everybody,
it's a particular problem here.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.600
If we can get around
and tackle this problem

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.120
we could address
a lot of issues.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.880
Since 80% of the economy
is in these legacy sectors,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.660
we limit our growth
rate by essentially

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.680
doing a new frontier kind of
innovation model of looking

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.870
at standing up the
next big thing,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.120
we lose track of what
we've done in the past,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.040
we tend to focus our innovation
on standing up new territories.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.390
That affects our
growth rate, right?

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.190
So the whole IT sector
in the United States,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.150
as huge as it is, is still
measured as only about 4.6%

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.360
of the US economy.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.940
That includes copper
wire telephones

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.250
and hard bound
books, too, right?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.995
In that information
technology sector.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.540
It's a challenging
issue of how to bring

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.875
innovation of the sectors.

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.750
If we could figure out
a better way to do it,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.960
if innovation is the dominant
causative factor of growth,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.090
then we start to think
about affecting our growth

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.300
rate in a new kind of way.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.130
So that's why this
case study, I think,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.310
is particularly significant, not
only for energy itself, which

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.120
is obviously very important, but
for its implications of how do

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.330
we innovate in legacy sectors.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.610
So we'll start with
Socolow and Pacala.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.789
And who's got
Socolow and Pacala?

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.340
Matthew?

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.419
All right.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:42.190
I'll just briefly
summarize their work.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:48.610
As you know, both
Princeton experts,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.900
they helped give us a
conceptual framework

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:59.590
for thinking about the challenge
coming up in energy technology.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.100
And the community
have been doing

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.162
a lot of fairly sloppy
thinking about-- everybody

00:09:05.162 --> 00:09:07.120
had their favorite silver
bullet that was going

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.640
to solve all problems, right?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.145
And Socolow and Pacala got us
thinking that, gee, there's

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:14.770
not going to be a
single silver bullet,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.290
there's going to be a
whole series of things that

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.700
need to be undertaken if we're
going to tackle the energy

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.720
technology challenge.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.690
And so they developed
something which is now

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.753
widely known as wedges theory.

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:29.920
And when they were writing--

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.360
if we just stabilized
CO2 and greenhouse gases,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.900
at the time they were writing,
that would have been enough.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.390
We now know that we've got
to go much more deeply.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.590
So it complicates this
wedges story significantly.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.860
But when they were
writing, as you can see,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.890
their assumption was
that would be the growth

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.860
curve of greenhouse
gases and we could simply

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.438
stabilize it by introducing
these wedges, that

00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:03.480
could tackle the problem.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.150
When they put this
out in 2004, it really

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.930
gave everyone a new
kind of picture,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.020
a new kind of
intellectual framework

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.680
to help think about
this big energy problem.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.800
They picked 15 different
energy initiatives,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.530
they argued that if you
did any seven of them

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.030
you could grow them in a
reasonable time frame into--

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.710
that multi decade time frame
into large enough wedges

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.680
of energy supply that you
could bring emissions down

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.120
over a five-decade period
to a stabilized 2005.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.040
So we now we've got an
80% reduction, not just

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.460
stabilization.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.700
But the concept
is still with us.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.910
Now, some of these
wedges were clearly

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.830
within the range of adoption,
and with a concerted effort

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.860
they could be scaled up
in a timely kind of way.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.610
Others were just plain
really hard to even think

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.230
about implementing.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.810
For example, they called
for massive deforestation.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.730
A big challenge in countries
where that would need to occur.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.630
They called for a 50%
reduction in driving

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.010
by 2 billion vehicles.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:15.510
Yeah.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.430
Good luck.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.420
You know, massive adoption
of conservation tillage.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.850
I mean, all these are
conceivable, right?

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.890
But some are harder than others.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.300
And they take not only
changes in government

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.740
to write to policy and
technology advance,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.660
they require very significant
behavioral challenges,

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.850
which is particularly
difficult to impose.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.560
And others, like carbon capture
and sequestration technology,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.240
are still, to this day, a
considerable time period away

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.400
from practical implementation.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.550
We don't have the
right technologies yet.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.872
And then there's a whole
period of development

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:57.330
and demonstration
that really needs

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.640
to be ongoing
before we can really

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.370
implement those approaches.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.870
We just don't know what the
best practices are, particularly

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.790
in the sequestration side.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.060
So that's some of
the challenges here.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.410
Interestingly, Socolow
and Pacala's work

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.490
got taken up by the contending
communities battling

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.630
over climate change
at that time.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.760
So Socolow and
Pacala, again, they're

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.160
only battling for
a 50% reduction--

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.850
I mean, excuse me, they're
battling for stabilization, not

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.580
a 50% or 80% reduction.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.040
They argued that we
could get their wedges

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.680
without doing a lot of
breakthrough work, right?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.870
That the solutions were at hand.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.757
So the environmental community
was facing a big battle

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:45.340
with industry.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.880
And the industry was saying,
sure, we'll do climate change,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.240
see in 20 years we're
going to do some R&D

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.330
and we should have it done
within at least 20-year period,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.500
no problem.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.210
So that was obviously
unacceptable

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.070
to the environmental community.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.070
They used Socolow and Pacala
to argue, wait a minute,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.950
we don't need to do these
fundamental breakthroughs,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.890
the solutions are at hand.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.670
So in effect it
pulled both sides off

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.110
of technology
development, right?

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.090
In a period of time
where we actually really

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.010
needed to do a lot of
technology development

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.843
because I would argue
with you that if we're

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:25.870
going to get to the
levels of CO2 reductions

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.270
that we need to reach, there
is a lot of technology advance

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.690
that needs to go on.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.420
And this kind of pulled
the debate out of that.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.950
It's not their fault, that's
not what they intended at all,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:46.487
but it created a kind
of positive agenda

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.070
for the environmental
committee that I

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:53.500
think in the end was misleading
to them as well as to others.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.630
So that was the dilemma
in what they proposed,

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.970
but nonetheless
this wedges concept

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.800
presents a picture of how we're
going to go after this problem.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.090
That remains
extremely important.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.330
Matt, it's all yours.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.880
MATT: Well, the first thing
I wanted to talk about

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.890
was Socolow and Pacala seem
to be writing to the world.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.080
They talk about
global emissions.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.050
And here they are publishing
in Scientific American

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.350
to popular science
readers in the US.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.780
I think a few people
also caught on this.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.960
Somewhere in the article they
mentioned that richer economies

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.530
tend to become less
energy-dependent because you're

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.320
not making steel or
doing these highly

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.900
energy-intensive activities.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.680
So I think it's important to
talk about whose responsibility

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.760
is it to pick up these
wedges, and is there a way

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.440
to optimize it so that we
don't keep developing economies

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.777
from developing in the process.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.670
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
kind of disagree at least

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.570
with the notion that the more
developed economies don't

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.320
use energy as much because--

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.780
or at least that
they don't pollute

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.613
as much, because at
least the United States,

00:15:08.613 --> 00:15:09.720
they pollute-- what is it?

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.980
The second most in the world?

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.640
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.265
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:14.300
We have like 25% of
the world's pollution,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.410
it's just here, even though
we're extremely developed.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:23.220
So I don't know if we can put a
lot of the blame on developing

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:23.890
countries.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.015
It's really the pot calling
the kettle black there.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.240
MATT: On the other
hand, I guess pollution

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:38.260
is something we can manage and
reduce without having that take

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.620
as much of a toll on our economy
as in developing countries

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.810
to start producing steel, right?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.790
AUDIENCE: Well, we
haven't done that yet.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.780
AUDIENCE: I think
that's interesting.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.270
I think there's the potential
for more developed countries

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.210
to take a smarter approach
to how they manufacture,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.570
but I really like that sentence.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.070
It really shook me up
because almost it's

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.500
like it implied the wealthier
that you get as a country

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.750
the less you need to
manufacture produce.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.730
I don't know if I'm
really misunderstanding

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.825
what that point was, but--

00:16:06.825 --> 00:16:08.950
AUDIENCE: I think the point
that you're referencing

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.550
is on page 56 of this report.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.770
And they talk about
how energy or how

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.100
manufacturers are increasingly
improving their energy

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.000
efficiency.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.940
They don't necessarily say
that the impetus is no longer

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.750
on the developing world or
that richer countries have

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.510
to take on energy
reductions, but specifically

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.520
that energy efficiency
is improving,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.030
and thus there is hope at
least in developed countries

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.140
to take up some of that,
I guess an increase

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.370
in the developing world in
manufacturing, specifically.

00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:46.160
AUDIENCE: I think the point
that they're referencing

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.630
specifically was
a bit earlier when

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:53.090
they say that heavy industries
like steel and manufacturing

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.160
tend to move out of the
more developed countries

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.930
to less developed countries.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.100
And my whole confusion
with that was

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.450
that it seems like they're
saying that that was going

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.619
to reduce emissions,
which, yes, it will reduce

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.260
the emissions in the US
and developed countries,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.450
but it's just like moving
them to a new place.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.599
So I was confused as to
why that is something

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.200
that they're commenting on
at all in this discussion

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.950
because it's just
moving emissions around,

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.119
it's not changing them.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.339
To the front page 52.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:27.839
Yeah.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.339
Sorry.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.958
That's on page 52, right?

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.750
Two long-term trends
are surely improving--

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.620
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm
really impressed, Steph.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.120
That's--

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.732 --> 00:17:35.440
AUDIENCE: First, as
societies get richer,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.330
the services sector
grows in importance

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.250
relative to
energy-intensive activities

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.170
such as steel production.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.068
So second deeply
ingrained in the pattern

00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:44.860
of technology evolution
is the substitution

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.380
of cleverness for energy, which
is their point about energy

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.798
efficiency.

00:17:48.798 --> 00:17:49.840
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.840
And as we know from the
manufacturing case study

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.220
earlier this semester,
that turned out

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.160
to be a problematic
view, largely

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.320
from economists about
the nature and importance

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.170
of significant
production systems

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.350
in developed economies, as well
as less developed economies.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.800
But it is a widespread
set of assumptions

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.410
that economists were
pressing at the time

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.780
that as though there
was a natural evolution

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.880
that an economy would naturally
evolve into more service sector

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.320
activities and forego the
need for a production cycle.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.490
The problem was that that
evolution, which certainly

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.460
took place the United
States, did not necessarily

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.590
forego the need for a
strong production sector

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:40.570
as well, as we discussed back
in classes four and five,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.290
because it turns out that
the production sector is

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.660
so deeply tied to your
innovation system itself.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.902
Sorry for the recap.

00:18:50.902 --> 00:18:51.610
MATT: Well, yeah.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.860
I was actually on
other question--

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.250
I think Sophia asked it--

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.210
was, now that kind of
thinking about this changing,

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.780
and maybe we don't want
just services focused

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.630
by sector or industry, and
we bring back manufacturing,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.650
does that mess up kind of
what Socolow and Pacala are

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.968
presenting here, where
that's something--

00:19:17.968 --> 00:19:19.510
in their model,
that's something that

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.230
will help us in the long run.

00:19:24.325 --> 00:19:25.700
AUDIENCE: Can you
say that again?

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.200
MATT: Yeah.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.870
So Socolow and
Pacala are saying,

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.438
as countries become
more developed

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:33.480
than the average economy.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.990
They kind of move towards
this service-heavy economy.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.900
And that in the long run
helps decrease or ease

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.180
that country's carbon emissions.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.360
But now that we've been
rethinking it and saying

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.970
manufacturing is something we
want back here in the United

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.390
States, that paradigm changes.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.050
And how much does that
disturb the presentation

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.227
of this wedge theory.

00:19:58.227 --> 00:20:00.060
AUDIENCE: So, actually,
I kind of a question

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.580
about how emissions
from the United States

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.660
decreased in the past 30 years?

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.815
If so, by how much?

00:20:05.815 --> 00:20:08.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: We actually
have been decreasing emissions,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.920
particularly the
last seven years

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.520
in a fairly significant rate.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.630
And, again, more analysis
needs to be done.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.110
Martha, you probably
have insights.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.985
AUDIENCE: Well, the only
insight they have is

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:20.445
because of the
natural gas boom is

00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:21.820
one of the big
reasons we've been

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.200
reducing emissions, not because
of less consumption or--

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.810
I mean, there's some energy
efficiency, but a lot of it

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.237
has to do with gas
being cleaner than coal.

00:20:32.237 --> 00:20:33.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.987
So we've gone through
a whole technology

00:20:34.987 --> 00:20:37.610
revolution led by fracking.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.490
And then, another factor here
is that frankly the US has

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.380
been de-industrializing, right?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.120
So when we reduce manufacturing
employment by 1/3,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.290
that turns out not to have been
primarily productivity gains.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.990
That turns out to be a real
hollowing out of that sector.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.620
So we shut down
60,000 factories,

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:03.380
as we talked about in class
four, between 2000 and 2010.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.700
So to some extent, these
are unintended consequences

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.220
of some problematic
developments in our economy.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.950
But the big one, I think,
Martha's put us on to

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.000
is the fracking revolution.

00:21:22.727 --> 00:21:24.560
AUDIENCE: Also, when
we do that measurement,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.190
is it based on the emissions
per production or are results

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.763
take into account, like
how much emissions you

00:21:30.763 --> 00:21:31.930
do by creating the products?

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.415
So I'm thinking
solar panels-- what

00:21:33.415 --> 00:21:37.190
would be the emissions to create
solar panels and produce them?

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.265
Because that would
affect the measurement.

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:39.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.180
So I don't know
the answer to that.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.390
I'm guessing it
doesn't include what

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.007
goes into the solar panels
or the wind turbines.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.560
And that's a tricky process.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.780
What is the net emissions of
a new technology, including

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.690
its own production and
installation systems?

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.730
Making those estimates
is not simple.

00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:09.623
How about one more
question, Matt?

00:22:09.623 --> 00:22:10.290
MATT: All right.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.630
Another question.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:17.600
Generally, what do people think
about the seven wedges theory?

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.510
So I saw some people
had questions about it

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.782
and I did too in terms of,
yeah, some of the wedges seemed

00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:26.240
really hard, but
some of the wedges

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.827
seem manageable on their own.

00:22:28.827 --> 00:22:30.410
But once you start
putting all of them

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:35.140
together, even just from
a financial perspective,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.320
it becomes marginally
more difficult to take

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.240
that next wedge.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.700
And they don't actually
seem exclusive.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.520
So if you look at
power generation,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.150
you raise the efficiency at
1,600 large coal fired plants

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.090
from 40% to 60%,
then another one

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.060
is replaced 1,400 large
coal fired plants with gas

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.200
fired plants.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.470
And does trying to do one wedge
cause another wedge to shrink?

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.000
And then you're looking
at adding up a lot more.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.080
I thought it was helpful,
for a popular science

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.110
magazine I thought was
a helpful framework,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.570
but I was wondering if
there were some shortcomings

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.770
that people had issues with.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.480
AUDIENCE: I was a
little surprised by how

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.970
fossil fuel focused it was.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.930
Still one of the big
solutions was carbon capture.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:29.870
And like you said, one of the
options is to keep using coal,

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.790
but to just make
it more efficient.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.610
So, I mean, I
understand the reality

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.150
that we probably will be reliant
on fossil fuels for a while,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.260
but I thought that this
is an interesting approach

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.200
to continue in such a way.

00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:49.350
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Martha, I know you've

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.633
thought about that question.

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:52.050
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess maybe only

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.420
thought I'm having is,
will the carbon capture

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.970
and storage has totally
not panned out yet

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.260
to be anything
close to economic.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.577
So it is a little
fanciful, a piece of it.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:06.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.840
On the other hand, the
possibilities that a purely

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.580
renewables approach.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.290
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.670
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Is going to be doable.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.200
You know.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.810
I think that's
problematic as well.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:18.780
AUDIENCE: Right, absolutely.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.500
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Because these are not

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.565
baseload power systems.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.380
AUDIENCE: For me, I found
the most problematic pieces

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.875
to be kind of--

00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:30.000
as we're commenting, it
did seem sort of arbitrary,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.583
but in addition to just sort of
just kind of picking whatever,

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:34.830
the ones that they
picked, it came down to,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.200
I don't know if I would
necessarily kind of start

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.300
if I was saying that
these are the 15 that

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.450
are going to be the most
feasible ways to get us

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.400
on these wedges.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.740
And I'm particularly looking
at stop all deforestation.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.615
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:48.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.330
I don't know if I
might need some more

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.100
reading in deforestation,
but that seems

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.860
to me like a variable
really interconnected kind

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.270
of big issue there.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.910
And I feel like
there's a lot more,

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.410
and agriculture
and forestry could

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.450
have picked before
kind of blanket

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.850
with just saying stop
all deforestation.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.370
And yeah.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.440
So I think within each
sector there could probably

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.180
be a more meticulous approach
to kind of make them exclusive,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.180
so you don't have this
sort of overlapping power

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.830
generation between coal fired
plants and things like that.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.050
That was my main
issue with the wedges.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.930
AUDIENCE: I thought it
was a very academic paper.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.170
I think it's a really good
lens to look at the problem.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.940
But in terms of
practicality, I don't

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.400
think it would be practical.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.760
It seems like it's kind
of idealized, like outside

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.022
reality.

00:25:38.022 --> 00:25:39.730
The approach I would
take with this paper

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.120
is to look at their assumptions
and then go out into the market

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.988
and talk to factories
and people who

00:25:44.988 --> 00:25:46.780
are using these
technologies and figure out

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.197
how they think
about these things,

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:50.840
because they might just be like,
that's not going to happen.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.180
So I think it's a good
lens, but I wouldn't--

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.598
I don't see it as practical.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.830
AUDIENCE: I just looked it up.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.240
Robert Socolow actually wrote
a follow-up article in 2011

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.630
called Wedges Reaffirmed
in Climate Central

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.415
to talk about the reception not
only from the general public,

00:26:11.415 --> 00:26:13.040
but also from the
scientific community,

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.780
from the policy
making community.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:20.112
And he seems to sort of be
of the opinion that he--

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:23.210
they not only overshot the
science of carbon capture,

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.370
but also really we're
trying to pander

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.500
to the quote-unquote
"general American"

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.000
and we're not as
sort of hard-hitting

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.810
with these solutions that
they could have proposed

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.790
in the magazine article.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.780
And in particular talked
about how people commented

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.170
on the concessions
that they made

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.260
leading to benign
outcomes on fossil fuels,

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.827
as you were saying, and that
they would foster complacency.

00:26:52.827 --> 00:26:54.410
And he says that he
doesn't understand

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.180
that fear because
when he tells someone

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.550
that we could be lucky to
figure out the technology,

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.800
then the listener completes
a sentence and says,

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.000
or we could be unlucky.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.150
So he seems to say
that we're kind

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.640
of between a rock
and a hard place

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.450
on trying to convince people to
create a framework for energy

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.750
reduction while also
sort of maintaining

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.627
our standard of living and also
caring about the environment.

00:27:17.627 --> 00:27:19.460
So he seems to have
gotten a lot of backlash

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.377
that he reflected
on for some time.

00:27:21.377 --> 00:27:22.460
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.570
Both of these folks are
very shrewd, talented people

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.170
and very perceptive.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.130
And part of the
story here was what

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.120
we thought was the
case in 2004 and 2005,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.850
which is just stabilization
at 2005 levels

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:44.000
would do it if we've got to get
a much deeper set of reductions

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.990
in the place.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.573
AUDIENCE: I think
even when they wrote

00:27:46.573 --> 00:27:48.350
this they suggested
that in the long term

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.460
we need to bring it down.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.502
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:53.330
All right they were aimed
at a 50 year period.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:58.487
They recognized that
in that later period

00:27:58.487 --> 00:28:00.320
there would really have
to be breakthroughs.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.420
But they avoided the
breakthrough problem

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.240
in the 50 year period,
but it's now on us.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.425
Right?

00:28:06.425 --> 00:28:08.800
We're going to have to have
a level of technology advance

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.750
that was passed what they were--

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.600
and what policymakers in general
were thinking about that time.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.100
That's a good closing
thought, Matt.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.640
Anything else to add on them?

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.140
MATT: Yeah.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.000
I think it's generally a good--

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.310
I thought it was a good
first article just that way,

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.840
but like Bush's
innovation pipeline,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.680
there's a lot more
complexity in the test

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.060
that we need to work through.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.935
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's a good comparison.

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:32.920
Thanks, Matt.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.440
All right.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.285
So we're now going
to dive into--

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.690
Chuck Weiss and I affected
a whole book on this.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:54.110
This is just a kind of
snapshot, but the idea

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.660
we tried to get across here is
that challenge is big enough

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.730
that we're going to have to get
inside the kind of black box

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.480
of innovation, innovation
policy, innovation proposition.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.740
So there'd been a lot of
articles around the time we

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.010
worked on this, 2009 timetable.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.040
And a lot of major
studies, and the studies

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.610
always said, and we're going to
need some technology advances,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.840
let's do a lot of R&D, right?

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.900
And that's kind of
as far as they went.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.910
And what we were attempting
to do in the book, as well

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:36.500
as pieces that came out of it,
like what I had you all read,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:43.130
was really dig into how that
innovation system worked

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.650
and understand it in a more
coherent and real kind of way,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.380
getting us in there to that
black box of innovation policy

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.450
and figure out
what could be done.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:58.760
Just as a few background points,
historically, the government

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.650
has been much more
interventionist

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.160
in the energy sector than
most other sectors, right?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.280
Government is historically very
interventionist in the health

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.250
sector, it's been very
interventionist in the energy

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.990
sector as well.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.970
And the political
parties tend to have

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.590
their favorite
technologies, which

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.730
complicates the political agenda
here for a technology agenda.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.160
It will complicate it for the
next several years for sure.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.160
We're already seeing
some of those slides.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.280
And then there's
another reality here,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:38.050
which is we don't have a
lot of the technologies we

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.240
need at hand yet.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.910
There's still a very significant
technology development effort

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.550
that needs to go on and a
series of these really important

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.270
strands.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.998
We can see what
the pathways are,

00:30:51.998 --> 00:30:54.040
but a lot of the technologies
we're going to need

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.960
are still not
technology ready, much

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.180
less being economically
ready, where

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.250
it's ready for market adoption.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:05.320
So that complicates this
challenge very significant.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.810
Energy is scale, right?

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.540
It is a gigantic sector.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.582
And you can't
consider energy policy

00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:15.915
unless you're considering scale.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.540
There is a technological,
economic, political, social

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:28.170
paradigm that creates barriers
to change in the energy sector

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.090
that are quite significant.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.090
Private sector R&D,
and obviously this

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.500
is private sector technology.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.865
The government is not in
control of this technology

00:31:36.865 --> 00:31:38.640
to say the least.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.450
Private sector R&D is
discouraged by wild price

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.150
oscillations in energy markets.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.820
We'll look at some of
those in just a minute.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:54.660
$20 a barrel in 1998, $140 a
barrel in 2008, $35 a barrel

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.600
in 2016.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.440
It's very hard to do R&D
against those kinds of price

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.390
disruptions.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.380
The public sector has
been working on energy R&D

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.040
and comparatively few
technologies have transitioned.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.295
Again, fracking frankly is the
major technology development

00:32:14.295 --> 00:32:17.460
that really has transitioned.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.610
And you've got to think
about parallel and supporting

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.390
policies, not only on
technology, but also on price.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.200
Right?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.290
So it's technology, supply,
but that's dramatically

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.150
affected by pricing.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.270
So very large in
scale and scope.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.420
The problem of energy,
as I said before,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.030
really is the problem of scale.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.880
You can think about a large
scale kind of activity,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.990
like an Apollo type
project for pursuing this,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:50.580
but you would not have an
Apollo type project that's

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.460
government contract-led, right?

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.950
We're not going to solve this
except in the private sector,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.300
which makes the effort
considerably more complicated.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.895
And as Socolow and
Pacala suggested to us

00:33:02.895 --> 00:33:04.270
in the reading we
just discussed,

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.540
this is a 50 year project.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.960
So the United States has never
done a 50 year technology

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.400
project.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.580
We're lucky if we do three year
technology projects these days.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.610
Apollo was a nine
year project, right?

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.970
That's about as long
as we can stand, much

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.590
less a multi-decade problem.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.430
And then, with a
multi-decade problem,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.720
we run the problem of
locking in prematurely

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.000
to wrong technologies.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.790
So that's the
fundamental problem

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.820
with corn-based ethanol,
which 1970s already

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.870
felt like, great, corn-based
ethanol, what could be better?

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:44.130
Farmers get rich, they grow
our energy for us, how nice.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.660
But it turned out to be not
as significant emissions

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.970
reduction, if anything,
maybe the opposite.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.440
So locking in.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.610
We're now every bit as addicted
to corn as we are to oil,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.270
and locking in prematurely on
a technology is a big problem.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.260
How do you maintain a certain
amount of technology neutrality

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.640
over a 40 year period?

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.600
We have never tried anything
as complicated as that before.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.929
And arguably, you need to
organize around barriers

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:18.940
to market launch, not just
throw R&D money at the problem.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.280
So we'll get into all of that.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.330
But energy arguably requires
a new unified theory

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:29.070
of innovation because it
is such a complex project.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.469
You can't just do
a pipeline model,

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.000
you can't just do in an
induced innovation model,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.430
you can't just do
a manufacturing

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.100
led innovation model.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.560
You've got to think much more
deeply about how you bring

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.400
all these models to bear using
an innovation organization

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.889
approach.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.320
It's kind of no way of getting
out of that box in the energy

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.210
sector.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.909
AUDIENCE: Is there
a paper that's

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:52.570
looking to pass
energy revolutions

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.762
and figure out like the
main kind of pushers?

00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.970
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well,
we went on too many, right?

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.120
So I don't know how
many million years it

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.460
took, but we did wood fire.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.300
We did that.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.030
That was big.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.600
Then, from wood we did coal.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.290
And [INAUDIBLE] tells the story
that William Barton Rogers,

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.860
the esteemed first
president, and frankly,

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:29.100
genius behind the MIT
model, he died on the podium

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.060
during an MIT graduation choking
on the terms by [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.550
coal revolution, right?

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.460
So that was the big
revolution in that era.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.520
We moved from wood the coal.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.990
So that's how slow it is.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.940
In a remarkably quick period
of time, you know 60, 70 years,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.630
we actually moved to oil.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.130
Right?

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.350
That was remarkably quick.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.320
And you know we've been on
that fossil fuel revolution

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.490
ever since.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.360
And it's not easy
to shift, so these

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.230
are very long-term projects.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.270
And you really have
to think about time

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:14.400
and scale over and over again
when we think about undertaking

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.750
energy technology change.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.400
So we talked about
some of the models

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.880
previously just to remind you
we know the pipeline model well.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.980
For sure there is going
to be a profound need here

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.390
for breakthrough research.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:33.300
There is a big valley of death
problem in that pipeline model

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.347
that we've got to
think very hard about.

00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:36.930
But that's not the
only problem, we've

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.855
got induced innovation here.

00:36:38.855 --> 00:36:40.230
In other words,
industry is going

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.140
they have to take responsibility
for a lot of these particularly

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.580
incremental advances.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.050
But how do you
encourage that when

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.810
the industry is locked
into a set of technologies

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.300
that you want to mitigate?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.180
That really complicates the
induced innovation model.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.120
Well, it was in the article.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.320
Chuck and I've been
thinking since then

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.510
because from the book
there's an extended pipeline

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.370
model, the whole defense
sector model where

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.370
the government engages not
just at the upfront stages,

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.670
but the later stages through
implementation as well.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.080
What can we use in that model?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.940
And that's a Defense
Department-owned model

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.910
by and large.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.800
And we'll talk later when we
talk about the Dorothy Rubin

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.270
reading about whether
that's applied.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.195
Manufacturing led.

00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:20.820
In other words, we're
not going to have

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.710
carbon pricing for a
significant period of time.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.220
So unless you drive
the price down,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.080
these technologies
will never enter.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.350
So the way you
drive price down is

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.200
through manufacturing
advances and process advances

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.300
and that becomes very
much part of what

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.150
you've got to consider in
an energy innovation model

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.150
as well.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.760
So innovation organization.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.130
How do you put these
complex pieces together

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.910
for a new model is really
at the core of this.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.630
So just to summarize so far,
it's a problem of scale,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.490
we're up against a
technological, economic,

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.970
political, social paradigm--
we'll talk about that

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:56.820
in a minute--

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.420
in a very complex
established legacy sector.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.790
And maintaining
technology neutrality

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.390
over a 50 year period, a
really critical problem,

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.840
which needs a tremendous amount
of thought and organizing.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.140
And then we've got to
undertake the integration

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.170
of the different models by
which the dynamics of innovation

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.790
get played out, right?

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.100
You can't just do pipeline
here, you can't just

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.645
do extended pipeline.

00:38:22.645 --> 00:38:24.270
You've got to really
bring all of these

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.250
to bear because they're
all part of that solution.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:31.110
So innovation organization
becomes central here

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.100
to an energy
technology revolution.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.680
Let's look at
investments in energy.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:47.590
So US federal R&D spending
on new energy technology

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.660
when we wrote this
piece was about half

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:55.940
of what it was in actual
dollars because it was in 1980.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.570
So the blue is public
sector investment.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.230
You can see the high
watermark about 1980,

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.450
and it's come down since then.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:07.120
The gray line is private
sector investment levels.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.580
You can, again, see
that that's basically

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.220
through this 2005 time
period and it hasn't

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.390
gotten much better since.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.812
That basically fell in
half, as well, right?

00:39:17.812 --> 00:39:19.270
So this is not the
picture you want

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.290
to have if you're going to
do a technology revolution,

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.250
all right?

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.460
Let's look at the way in
which innovating industries,

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.810
how do they spend when they're
trying to do major technology

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.870
implementations?

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.900
The semiconductor
industry invests 16%

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.160
on average of annual
revenues in R&D.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.710
And they've got to
stay on Moore's Law.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.320
Moore's Law may have just
ended, but that was a long term

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.460
project for them and they had to
keep investing in R&D to do it.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.820
The pharmaceutical
sector invests 18%

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.850
because their drug
terms keep running out.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.800
They've got to stay on
top of the R&D side.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.680
The biotech sector invests 39%.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.780
That may be a little
unfair comparison

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.360
because a lot of
the biotech industry

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.210
has no revenues at all, so it
may skew the numbers a bit.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.000
But the other two are
probably pretty good signals.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.200
Established industry.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.330
The electronics
industry, 8% of sales.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.720
The auto industry, at least
before the great recession,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.810
was around 3% to
3 and 1/2 percent

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.725
of annual revenues in R&D.
Those are pretty mature sectors.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:35.540
Average R&D to annual revenues
for all of US industry is 2.6%.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.880
That includes dry
cleaners, right?

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.120
That's everybody, that's all in.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.580
Private energy R&D as
a percentage of R&D--

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:51.872
R&D as a percentage of annual
revenues is less than 1%.

00:40:51.872 --> 00:40:54.860
How are we going to do this?

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.440
And this does not--

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.580
this is not good, right?

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.670
Now, why is it so low
in the energy sector?

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.040
Well, part of the story is that
the revenues are so enormous,

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.540
right?

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.760
This is a powerful
revenue-generating sector.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.840
So that's part of it, but
it's not a full explanation.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.050
This is a sector that's
got an economic model

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.560
and it's sustaining
that model, and it's not

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.320
all that interested
in diversification

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.920
from what's an extremely
successful set of approaches.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.810
Now, let's say we up
the federal R&D, right?

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.070
To kind of offset not a
terribly pretty picture

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.500
on the private sector R&D side.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.910
When the feds really
want to do something big,

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.190
what kind of money
do they spend it on?

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.020
The Apollo program,
over nine years-- now,

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.820
this is both R&D
and implementation.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.580
That was $185 billion in 2002
dollars over that nine year

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.020
period.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.050
Carter-Reagan defense
buildup, right?

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.530
That got us know all the
stuff we read about in DARPA,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.700
precision, stealth,
UAVs, submarines

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.180
that nobody likes to talk
about, a bunch of fancy stuff.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.600
That was $445 billion
over eight years.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.650
Doubling NIH was $138
billion over five years.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.480
The ballistic missile
defense program,

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.080
which until fairly recently
was the largest technology

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.500
initiative the government had
going, its first six years

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.580
was $145 billion.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.580
That's what the government
spends when it really

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.760
wants to get technology done.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.670
It's not spending
this on energy.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.170
OK?

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.253
We're not at those levels.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:51.310
Interestingly, this is energy
in R&D spending compared

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:52.930
to the price of crude oil.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:57.570
And you can see the remarkable
similarities in these lines,

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.600
right?

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.180
Price of oil goes up,
let's throw some R&D at it.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.060
Price of oil goes down,
pull that R&D back, right?

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.987
You can't run an R&D program
with sustained results on kind

00:43:07.987 --> 00:43:09.070
of a roller coaster model.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.240
It just doesn't work.

00:43:13.077 --> 00:43:15.160
This story is not just
true for the United States.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.680
These are all the developed
countries, the OECD countries.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.570
You can see a high
watermark about 1980

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.838
and similarly coming down
to less than half of that.

00:43:24.838 --> 00:43:26.380
The black line is
the one to look at.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.210
The International
Energy Agency--

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.810
which is the energy arm
of the OECD countries,

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.520
a highly respected
data collection,

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.700
energy analytical crew--

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.250
in 2008 they did a
major study and they

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.380
concluded that
reducing emissions

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:50.550
to 50% below 2005 levels.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.910
When they added up the R&D
as well as the technology

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.100
implementation that
need to be undertaken,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:01.260
they estimated that
at a $45 trillion

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:09.210
project over a 50 year period,
about $1.1 trillion worldwide,

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:14.580
$1.1 trillion per year
in R&D implementation.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.790
So, you know, that
number may be way off.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.070
They were guesstimating, we
got to do this much solar,

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:21.600
we got to do this
much wind, we have

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.010
to do this much
advanced nuclear,

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.010
we have to have this much carbon
capture and sequestration.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.610
They were kind of adding up
what the bill might look like.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.640
So it could be
significantly off--

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.910
but by the way, even if
it's off by a whole lot,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.040
we're not in range.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.220
So so far, we've been
talking about this

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.630
as though it was a problem we
could just shovel money at.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.130
Right?

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.640
That's we've been talking about
for the last five minutes.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.480
But everybody in
this class knows

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.140
that innovation and a
complex legacy sector,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.100
like energy, it's much
more complicated than just

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.700
throwing money at the problem.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.440
So you've seen
these slides before.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.460
The US is a covered wagon
technology culture, right?

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:18.910
We like to leave our old
neighborhoods behind and move

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.030
new technology into
open field new frontier

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.060
kind of innovation, we take
our covered wagons west,

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.130
we go over the mountain,
we settle new technology

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:28.222
territories.

00:45:28.222 --> 00:45:30.430
That's what we're pretty
good at, we like to do that.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.270
We're not good at
this problem, right?

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:37.450
Bringing technology advanced
back into established sectors.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.490
We don't do this.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.640
And that technology, as
we've discussed before,

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.003
it has to parachute in.

00:45:44.003 --> 00:45:45.670
And by the way, the
incumbents are going

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.110
to shoot at it on the way down.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.370
So it's not just a matter
of throwing R&D money

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.210
at this problem.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.180
We've got a much
bigger problem, right?

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:55.750
Max.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.410
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.660
You said that we're not very
good at going in covered wagons

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.160
east.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.440
Is there anyone that is?

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You know,
developing countries that

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.100
don't have mature
legacy sectors tend

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.120
to be able to innovate
in many, many areas.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.450
So that is the story
of the stunning growth

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:23.410
numbers that China has built
over the last 30 years, right?

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.990
Because there wasn't
much there, so they

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.360
didn't have to overcome
these legacy sectors.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.430
They were working in
innovating in every sector.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:36.160
So they build this remarkable
10% a year growth rate.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.990
They've now built
out a lot of it.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:40.830
So their growth rate is going
to finally come down a bit

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.180
and it's starting to do so.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.430
But that gives you a signal
of the kind of growth rate

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.070
you could have if you were able
to innovate across the board,

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:51.360
not just in frontier areas.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.860
Martha.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.068
AUDIENCE: But is it not just
because they didn't have

00:46:54.068 --> 00:46:57.390
anything there in China,
because they're so top-down,

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.890
they could--

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:58.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.490
I mean, there's organizational
issues like that too.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:07.990
But you can look at Korea,
you're looking at Taiwan,

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.920
and you can look at the IT
economy in India, right?

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.590
Another staggering success story
of stunning rates of advance.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.290
The government had
kind of fenced off

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.850
most of hard industries into a
fairly socialist kind of system

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.170
and pretty inefficient.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.770
They haven't fenced
off the IT sector

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.240
and that was not a
heavy governmental hand,

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.490
that was just take off, right?

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.720
And it's a remarkable story.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.850
So it's not always the
way-- you don't always

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.620
need that governmentally hand,
but it's an important point.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.990
So the US just doesn't
do this very well.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.370
The example on the
slide is, we don't

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.590
go back and fix the health
care delivery system.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.750
We've been fighting over
that for about 15 years.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.350
We're pretty good at
doing biotech, right?

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.850
That worked.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.270
But taking on a whole
health care delivery system

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.400
has proved elusive
to say the least.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.105
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:08.105 --> 00:48:10.480
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
hospitals and the whole service

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.890
side of health care.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.630
And there's technology
tied to that across, too.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:20.480
So a complex established sector
is not a level playing field,

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:20.980
right?

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.620
One of the advantages
of technology

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.100
stand up in a frontier
is there's no incumbent,

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.080
you just do it.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:27.580
Right?

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.650
That's the India story, right?

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.678
That's the story of the
IT revolution in the US.

00:48:32.678 --> 00:48:34.720
There wasn't anything
really quite like computing

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.400
before computing, it just--

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.820
there was nobody in the way.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:45.250
Similarly, biotech didn't
really have anybody in the way,

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.680
whereas these health care
delivery or energy problems are

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.460
much more complicated because
you're up against established

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.300
incumbents.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:58.120
And these incumbents have strong
technology models and systems

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.430
often with vast
infrastructure, right?

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.480
Think about gas stations
and gas pipeline systems.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.270
They have an economic model and
they've driven down the cost

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.910
curve, so it's a
remarkably efficient system

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.600
with remarkably low
energy prices in the US.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.870
There's a massive political
support system, right?

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:21.490
These are strong regional
employers and important parts

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:23.080
of local and regional
economies, they

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.900
are very strong politically.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.020
And there's a whole
social support system.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:33.190
For many decades, chemical
engineering departments

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:37.510
were essentially at every
unit major university,

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.350
were essentially part of
the fossil fuel system.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.000
That's obviously
changed, but there

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.590
was a whole set of
academic social support

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.150
systems that are there.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.780
And, look, the US public
has an expectation

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.040
that we get cheap energy prices.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.540
Right?

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.850
Try taking that one
on, politically, right?

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.850
That's one of the political
problems with trying

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.960
to impose a carbon tax.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.570
What a wonderful message--

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.870
hey, all your energy prices
are going to go up, you know?

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:12.405
It's not a terribly
attractive political message.

00:50:12.405 --> 00:50:14.530
And part of the problem
here is that the new energy

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:18.580
technologies have got to be
price competitive the moment

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.420
they arrive in the marketplace.

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.070
So we'll get to that
problem in a minute.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.200
A carbon charge was going
to be a way to adjust this.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.670
In other words, it would bring
the fossil fuel prices up,

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.470
and therefore, the
new technologies

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.860
didn't have to drive down nearly
as much down the cost curve.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.230
It would be easy
to introduce them.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.661
They, in effect, have a
significant incentive.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.500
We're not going to
do that, at least

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.790
for a significant
period of time.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:50.600
So what do we do?

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.400
Some things we've
talked about already,

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.860
we've got to have a
large program that's

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.667
sizable in scope.

00:50:57.667 --> 00:50:59.750
In the US, it's going to
have to be private-sector

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:05.000
led because that's where all the
technology and infrastructure

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.650
is.

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:11.372
Government doesn't control
it except in certain ways.

00:51:11.372 --> 00:51:13.580
That means a public-private
partnership kind of model

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.200
is going to be needed.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.300
You've got this problem
of technology neutrality

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.080
and avoiding technology lock-in.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.790
And, again, we're
going to have to think

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.910
about organizing this one we're
getting into now around launch

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:27.410
pathways.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.880
So we came up with a kind of
a four-step way of looking

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.350
at launching technologies.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:38.065
So there's lots of
literature on R&D

00:51:38.065 --> 00:51:40.190
and you've read now a fair
amount of it by the time

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.010
we reach class 10 here.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.640
But there's very little
literature on market launch.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.770
It just is not a topic
that has been taken up

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.100
by the science and
technology policy literature.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:01.040
So the essentially idea was,
think about launch pathways.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.810
Different technologies going
to launch in different ways.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.320
Launching batteries into
an automotive sector

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.770
is a really different project
than launching biofuels

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:13.970
into the transport sector.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.650
But figure out the
launch pathways

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.240
and figure out for
some common launch

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.630
pathways that certain
kinds of technologies have,

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.590
and we'll get to
that in a second.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.570
Then, step two is tie those
launch pathways to whatever

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:35.190
means of policy support you can
put to those launch pathways,

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.160
right?

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.260
Do a gap analysis in
the innovation system,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.320
both front end and
back end, and then

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.810
work on filling in the gaps
in that innovation system.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:46.790
So a four-step process.

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.940
We'll take these
apart for a minute.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.430
The US has never tried to do
anything this tough, right?

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:55.160
I think there have been
technology challenges

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.770
themselves that are
harder than this, right?

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.332
Because we can kind
of see the strands

00:53:00.332 --> 00:53:02.540
that we're going to get over
the next 25 or 30 years.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.320
They're kind of out there.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.090
We kind of know what
solar is going to be like,

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.075
we kind of know what
wind is going to be like,

00:53:07.075 --> 00:53:08.450
we can see what's
going to happen

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.790
in storage to some extent.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.620
We kind of know what the
paths are going to be.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.993
And these are not--

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:18.410
this is not like the Manhattan
Project, that was a tougher

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.310
technology project.

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:23.960
But this is such a tough
implementation task,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.200
we have never ever tried to do
anything this complex before.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.400
So it's a challenge
worthy of your careers.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.950
It is the big one.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:35.483
Martin?

00:53:35.483 --> 00:53:36.900
AUDIENCE: So your
focus is policy,

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.300
Weis's is government because
you both wrote a book together,

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:40.928
right?

00:53:40.928 --> 00:53:41.970
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:48.087
Chuck was-- he and I
taught at Georgetown

00:53:48.087 --> 00:53:49.670
and he was chairman
of the department,

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:54.010
so he was the one who kicked me
into teaching some years back.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.310
And then, we just got to
know each other, decided

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:01.950
let's take this book on
because we saw that the science

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:06.210
and technology policy world,
it just not really thought

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.492
about the details of the
technology policy for energy.

00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:11.200
Obviously, this one,
a lot of literature.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.460
AUDIENCE: Because I was thinking
it would be interesting if you

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.520
talked to like a Sloan
strategy professor,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.970
like a [INAUDIBLE] strategy
because they would have some

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.130
insights into--

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.853
because it's not
intuitive, usually,

00:54:20.853 --> 00:54:22.770
like a business component
strategy, especially

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.420
for complex sectors,
but it definitely

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.800
is a way of doing it.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.000
Usually you focus
on very niche market

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.530
that you know no one would try
to fight you at the beginning

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:33.300
and then you grow and you grow.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:33.780
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.738
And we're going to get
into exactly that point,

00:54:35.738 --> 00:54:38.220
too, Martin, that's a very
key step in our strategy

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.860
for a lot of these technologies.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.155
AUDIENCE: And another
thing-- another reason too

00:54:41.155 --> 00:54:41.910
is because it's not simple.

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:44.285
Since it's complex, you'll
need different business models

00:54:44.285 --> 00:54:45.900
for different kinds
of products, so I

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.083
feel like they can
make a matrix that

00:54:48.083 --> 00:54:49.500
might be really
useful, especially

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.542
like MIT Energy Initiative,
because I'll be like,

00:54:51.542 --> 00:54:53.170
oh, if you have this
kind of strategy,

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.670
this is a task-- this is how
I would go about growing it.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.320
And with MIT especially,
you have mentors

00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.790
that are going to be there.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.470
There are some connections--
it'd be really interesting.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.110
And look-- a lot of
this thinking I did

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:06.900
was because I got pulled
into the MIT Energy

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.540
Initiative in
various ways, and had

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.910
to think with the
faculty teams that

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.920
are developing these
amazing reports that MITI

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.006
did over the years.

00:55:17.006 --> 00:55:18.600
I had to understand
those reports

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.700
because I had to help
those communities bring

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.100
their reports to
the policy world,

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.790
so I had to read
in pretty deeply--

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:30.330
so a lot of what I'm stumbling
onto in the article you read,

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.630
but also the book that is
a larger statement of it

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.940
really comes out of
my MIT experience.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.680
And of course Sloan
was pretty deeply

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.730
involved in each one of
those, which was part

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.300
of what made them powerful.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.280
But Martin, when I
do the next edition,

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.160
I'm going to get you to
do the business side.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.100
So let's go back
to step one we'll

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.500
do a little more detail here so
you get what I'm talking about.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.190
Let's categorize the
launch categories, right?

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.730
So we know we've got to
do a bunch of wedges--

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.440
different technologies
often embedded

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.830
in each different wedge.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:09.960
How do we look at
launch pathways

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.060
as a way of looking at
the different launch

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.980
pathways in energy, and
seeing if some are similar,

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.090
then you could aggregate
the policy support

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:18.250
mechanisms around those.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:23.040
So some technologies
are experimental,

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.710
and are just going to
require long term research.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.090
So Max, that's
your paper, right?

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:32.580
Fusion is still long
term, incredible potential

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.560
if we could get there.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.620
We're not really
ready for much more

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.060
beyond R&D and some
demonstration commitments

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.210
at this stage.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:45.990
So that's a federal R&D role--

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:49.820
hydrogen fuel cells, a
similar kind of problem.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.070
So that's experimental
technologies--

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:53.330
that's one category.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.900
Just do R&D for those folks.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.420
The second category would
be potentially disruptive

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.750
innovations that could be
launched in-- you guessed it,

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.660
Martin--

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.030
niche markets, right?

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:09.740
So that's typically
how induced innovation

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.788
works in the private sector.

00:57:11.788 --> 00:57:14.330
A private sector company will
identify market opportunities--

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.490
typically a niche market--

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:19.505
take that market, move into
it, and start to scale up

00:57:19.505 --> 00:57:21.110
a new technology advance.

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:25.280
That's the LED story--
remarkable success story.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.350
They found niche
markets that couldn't

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:31.730
be dealt with by either
of their incandescent

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.940
or fluorescent
technology competitors.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.726
They found niche markets
where LEDs were--

00:57:38.726 --> 00:57:41.690
a so much better answer
than the competitors,

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.150
and then they scaled
into those niche markets,

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.120
and they used that
opportunity to drive the price

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.580
down so that, when
the time came,

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.760
they could actually compete
over that extended time

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.560
period of driving the
cost down to compete

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.518
with the other sectors.

00:57:55.518 --> 00:57:59.570
So that's a classic example of
launching into a niche market.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:02.780
Solar PV has had some of
that opportunity as well--

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:07.340
that's been launched into
a bunch of niche markets.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.330
But then, there's a more
complicated category,

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:11.840
and these are--

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.820
we'll call them
secondary innovations,

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.770
or component
innovations, and this

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.350
is a lot of what energy is.

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:20.450
Secondary innovations
are components

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:26.270
in larger systems that face
immediate price competition

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:33.200
based on price, but they can
launch in an uncontested way

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.080
if the owner of that larger
system wants them, right?

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:44.770
If that technology is acceptable
to that system owner, operator,

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:45.910
then they can be accepted.

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.702
So all they have to do
is drive price down,

00:58:47.702 --> 00:58:49.360
and then they can
come in, right?

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.940
So batteries for
plug-in hybrids--

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:56.320
that's a great
example here, right?

00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.880
The auto sector-- they've been
burned so many times by fossil

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.490
fuel prices that's
complete wrecked them--

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.490
we're on time number three now--

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.930
that they're happy to have a
much larger share of hybrids,

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.490
or indeed electrics, in
their auto portfolio.

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:18.040
So this would not be a
contested launch-- they're

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.030
willing to take this stuff.

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:21.610
But you've got to
get the price down,

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.068
which we still haven't been
able to achieve yet from really

00:59:24.068 --> 00:59:25.210
widespread introduction.

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:29.470
But that would be an example
of a secondary innovation

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:32.900
with an uncontested launch.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:38.180
The hard stuff is
secondary innovations

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.920
with a contested launch.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.410
That's carbon capture
and sequestration.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.880
So the message to a utility
company in that situation is--

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:54.310
hi, we want you to do carbon
capture and sequestration.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:58.960
This is going to reduce the
efficiency of your plant by 40%

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.070
and add 50% to your costs, or
numbers somewhat like those.

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:03.470
Is that ballpark
numbers, Martha?

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.970
Is that in range?

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:06.520
MARTHA: And there's no upside--

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.415
I mean there's no financial--

01:00:07.415 --> 01:00:09.498
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
what's the benefit here?

01:00:09.498 --> 01:00:11.170
And finance it too--

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.910
you finance it, right?

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.520
And nail your utility
customers, right?

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.280
Good luck.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:16.780
Right?

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.760
That's what you call
a contested launch.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.920
The only way these people
are going to do this

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.077
is if you tell them--

01:00:24.077 --> 01:00:25.660
they're going to
violate criminal laws

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.480
unless they do it.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.820
I mean, that's about
all you can do here.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.530
You have to regulate
these, right?

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.680
There's no other move.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.790
I mean, there are some
other categories here, too,

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:38.440
that we need conservation and
end-use efficiency always needs

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.320
work, and advances
in manufacturing--

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.610
technologies for scale up.

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.290
Those are important
as well, but these

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:49.040
are the four major territories,
the four major launch pathways,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.540
we have.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.680
And then we've got a whole set
of policy packages, all right?

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.200
So for front end support, right?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.110
We do R&D, and--

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:01.480
it would be great to
grow some of that R&D.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.400
That will help us with
experimental, that'll

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.480
help us in all four
categories, because all

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.950
these technologies need work.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:13.540
Back end incentives, to
encourage the technology

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.150
deployment, right?

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.180
That's really needed for
secondary or component

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.130
technologies, particularly
when they've gotten--

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.460
the need for both
contested and uncontested.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.730
But you could really use
these incentives to encourage,

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.190
and we've done it, lower
prices of automobiles

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.200
that happen to be hybrids
or electrics, right?

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.130
So we've done those.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:37.930
You can see what I'm
talking about here--

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:40.780
tax credits, loan
guarantees, price guarantees,

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.990
government procurement programs,
new product buy-down programs--

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:46.120
we've tried a whole
series of these.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.640
And Congress just renewed
a lot of the tax incentives

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.010
that have been so
important to wind and solar

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:52.780
for a multi-year
period last year,

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.720
so those are going to
remain in place for a while.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.370
But front end, R&D support.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:03.130
Back-end incentives,
carrots-- typically

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:05.740
for uncontested launch.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:09.957
Niche-- remember, the industry,
if it can find a market niche,

01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:11.290
you don't have to do this stuff.

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:13.857
They're going to need help on
the front end R&D probably,

01:02:13.857 --> 01:02:15.940
but if you can launch into
a market niche-- that's

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.398
why it's so attractive to try
and find a market niche where

01:02:18.398 --> 01:02:20.230
we can launch these
technologies, right?

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.750
Because that's a way of
starting to scale up,

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:26.740
and then buying yourself time
to drive down the price curve.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.580
The hard one is sticks, right?

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.310
So for secondary technologies
where you're going to have

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:36.280
a contested launch-- the
industry sector doesn't want

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.440
it--

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.630
you're going to have to
use regulatory requirements

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:44.300
and mandates to require
this to occur, right?

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.290
And-- a carbon tax
is a form of this.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:52.730
It's organized around-- creating
a new kind of financial reality

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:54.050
for these kinds of firms.

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:59.570
So pick your energy
technology, see

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:01.550
if you can group it
into a launch category,

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:05.390
and then step two-- tie
your incentive package

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.210
to those launch pathways.

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.750
Follow me so far?

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.350
OK.

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.780
Step three-- you're
familiar with this by now--

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.530
look at the gaps in
the innovation system,

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.420
and you've got to look at
the gaps on the front end,

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.590
and you got to look at
the gaps in the back end

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.200
of the innovation system.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.390
And then step four--

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.990
duh.

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:31.130
Fill the gaps, right?

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.070
In that innovation pipeline.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.730
And that moves from every stage,
from research and development,

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.730
all the way through
prototype and demonstration,

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.700
and testing, and deployment,
into a commercial market--

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.100
you've got to look at all
of those stages, right?

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.390
And the production phase
too, as we've talked about.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.840
We've talked about identifying
the gaps in the innovation

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.340
system--

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.980
I'm going to skip this--

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.250
some mechanisms that we'll talk
about in this class for filling

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.780
some of those gaps.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.930
ARPA-E, arguably-- and we'll
talk about this in a bit--

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:02.660
filled a gap in the
US energy R&D system

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.100
for breakthrough
technology advances.

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.070
Maybe we need a better
government mechanism

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.920
for large scale
testing and deployment.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.810
There's a sore need in carbon
capture and sequestration,

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.080
and we lack a
government corporation

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.528
that can conduct this kind
of demonstration level.

01:04:23.528 --> 01:04:25.070
That's part of the
reason why we just

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.403
haven't been able to get there
in terms of demonstration

01:04:27.403 --> 01:04:29.240
of that technology.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.020
Those are some gap standards--
test beds are part of the gaps.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.300
In energy, there is this big
problem of new functionality.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.550
That's a technology problem you
need to understand in energy.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:48.660
IT created new functionality
from the outset.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.720
So you've heard me
tell this story before.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.500
I was happy to spend a
ridiculous amount of money

01:04:54.500 --> 01:05:00.530
on my Apple 2E because it
did all kinds of stuff for me

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.470
that I couldn't
do before, right?

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.510
That would be new functionality.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.930
Spreadsheets, all kinds
of stuff like that, right?

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:13.200
Energy technologies--
first generation,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.662
by and large, don't give
you new functionality.

01:05:17.662 --> 01:05:19.245
The nice thing about
new functionality

01:05:19.245 --> 01:05:22.620
is that people are willing
to pay a premium if they

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.810
can do something entirely new.

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:28.470
But I don't know
whether my laptop

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:34.590
is plugged into coal or nuclear
power, or hydro, or the sun--

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:35.910
I have no idea, right?

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.700
There's no product
differentiation for me

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.510
in the way in which
I get electricity.

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.235
Now some utilities--

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:43.860
Connecticut is an
interesting example--

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.740
are attempting to
create that background

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.440
knowledge for consumers, so they
can actually pick technologies

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.430
they're interested
in, but that's

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.520
not a widespread model yet.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.790
So there's not much new
functionality in electricity--

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:00.090
they're all still electrons.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.030
It's tough to do
product differentiation.

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:08.310
Cars, right?

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:15.350
There is a difference
between a Tesla and--

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:18.660
the thing I drive, right?

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:24.360
Because if you happen to be into
rapid torque and acceleration,

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.300
Tesla does provide you
similar functionality--

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.090
but that's about it.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:31.100
In most driving
circumstances, it's just not

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.850
all that different,
and a hybrid certainly

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:35.430
is not all that different.

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:38.670
Tesla brilliantly
figured out, as did

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:46.500
Prius, brand differentiation
in their market launch.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.010
They figured out how to
create a really cool vehicle,

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.980
and you could sell it on
your image of yourself

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.798
as being cool for
buying a Tesla, right?

01:06:54.798 --> 01:06:56.215
It worked very
well in California,

01:06:56.215 --> 01:06:57.880
and still does does, right?

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.307
And Prius did something
similar, right?

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.890
You're not just
driving a car-- you're

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:05.640
bragging about your
environmental outlook

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.690
on the world, right?

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.480
So this is a way of
getting around the fact

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.910
that there isn't that much
product differentiation,

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.850
there's not that
much functionality

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.220
in the energy sector.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.720
I think there will be.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.690
I'd like to--

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:24.330
LEDs are quite neat,
and you can have

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:27.140
a light wall, or a light floor.

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.250
And I'd pay for that--

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.620
that would be cool, as opposed
to a light bulb hanging

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.790
overhead.

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.350
That's new functionality,
so I'd pay for that.

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:40.770
But that's not first generation
of energy technologies--

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.930
that's not happening yet.

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:49.270
It's harder to create product
differentiation and new

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.370
functionality in the
first generation of energy

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:55.420
technologies, which
underscores how complicated

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.440
the market launch is.

01:07:58.678 --> 01:08:00.220
AUDIENCE: There are
some technologies

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.952
that can offer new
functionality, if not

01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:03.952
for the consumer, then
for the people are paying

01:08:03.952 --> 01:08:06.260
for it-- like the utility.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.580
One example would be--

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.033
fusion produces
lots of neutrons,

01:08:09.033 --> 01:08:11.200
and you could use that to
get rid of nuclear waste--

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.198
could be nice, and there's
virtually nothing else

01:08:14.198 --> 01:08:14.990
that could do that.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.073
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:08:16.073 --> 01:08:19.404
So yes, that may be the silver
bullet-- we're just still

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:20.459
a while away from it.

01:08:20.459 --> 01:08:23.001
AUDIENCE: Nuclear waste is like,
a trillion dollar market, so

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:23.501
[INAUDIBLE].

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:24.584
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:08:24.584 --> 01:08:26.640
And the problem for
the utility companies

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.040
is, to adopt new technologies
they-- generally speaking--

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.510
have to pay more, right?

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:33.050
Although we're working on
driving those costs down.

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.350
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: We
made a lot of progress.

01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:37.410
AUDIENCE: What I'd look into
[INAUDIBLE] like a process,

01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:42.240
it's a whole supply chain
for energy, so lines,

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.870
where you produce it, when it
gets over, and what dissipates.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:48.210
So figuring out how
the supply chain

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:51.812
is flawed to create products
that fix the supply chain,

01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:54.270
so it's a lot better, and they
don't have those [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:55.140
by the way.

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.000
That's the product, right?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.859
This system is broken, I fix
the system with this product,

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:02.130
and so because energy
is going to come out

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.140
either way the same way, right?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.460
That's how I think about it.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:05.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Right, and you

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:08.520
can think about smart grid
options that do create

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.229
new functionalities as well

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.646
AUDIENCE: Or mobile
energy sources

01:09:11.646 --> 01:09:13.812
that can be near cities,
because then you don't have

01:09:13.812 --> 01:09:15.000
to transport them long ways.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.910
And-- especially for
disrupting big companies,

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:20.357
they spend so much money
on putting the lines,

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.899
and they have to
pay for regulations,

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.380
and it slows them down.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:26.967
So a new mover can do something
like that, and disrupt them.

01:09:26.967 --> 01:09:28.050
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:30.187
Finding those market
niches is a task

01:09:30.187 --> 01:09:31.770
that is now upon us,
because we're not

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:34.859
going to do a carbon tax.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:37.770
So let me just
recap for a minute.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.620
You have to apply all
the innovation models--

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.500
pipeline, induced,
extended, manufacturing led,

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.640
innovation, organization.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.979
You've got to think about
this, and [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.470
by looking at all the
dynamics of innovation

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:51.720
and how to organize them.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.210
And we need the four step
process here-- figure out

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:58.920
the launch categories, group
them with similar technologies,

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.320
apply the right incentive
package to that category.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.070
Look at the gaps in
the innovation system,

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.720
and work on filling those gaps.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.690
So that's the four-step
process we've got so far.

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:13.980
That's enough.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.920
Why don't we do some Q&A here?

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.860
Sorry for that extended
wrap, but you basically

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.030
now know everything I know.

01:10:24.038 --> 01:10:24.830
Who's got this one?

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:25.620
MATT: I have.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All
right, Matt, all yours.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:27.330
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:29.730
I think you managed to be
more thorough than the reading

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:30.230
example.

01:10:31.973 --> 01:10:33.640
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's because there

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.280
was a book behind
it, but I didn't

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.670
want to make you buy two of
my books-- one is enough.

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:42.090
MATT: I guess my main innovation
was very similar to Max's.

01:10:42.090 --> 01:10:44.960
I think all of the other
readings for this week--

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.000
look at things that
the US is trying,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.430
but I think it would be
really interesting to talk

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.780
about learning opportunities.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.280
You mentioned China, and it
still seems like that's-- maybe

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.390
to me at least--

01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:02.370
not going back east as
much as going into--

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.700
AUDIENCE: The centralization?

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.200
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.810
MATT: Sure, yeah.

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:11.130
And just not making the
same mistakes that we made,

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:12.053
setting up first.

01:11:12.053 --> 01:11:13.470
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, they are

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.940
standing up two
thousand-megawatt coal-fired

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.160
power plants a week still.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.930
MATT: So are there true examples
of really innovating, where you

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:29.520
already have a legacy sector.

01:11:32.843 --> 01:11:34.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You know, when

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:38.970
we read that reading on DARPA
a couple of classes ago,

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:43.590
as we talked about at the
time, the defense sector--

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.420
it's a legacy sector, right?

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:48.330
It's very locked into
its technologies,

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:52.440
into its social organization,
into its economic and budgeting

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.640
models.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.300
It's very hard to
innovate there--

01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.030
you're up against a lot of
established systems there.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:07.260
Yet DOD has been able to
bring on a whole set of very

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.600
interesting advanced
technologies over the last 25

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.890
or 30 years.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:15.840
So it does tell you that this
is not Mission Impossible,

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.690
and there are
organizational lessons--

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:21.450
as you've read in the textbook--

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:26.790
that we can pull out of DOD.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:29.652
Part of it has to do
with some of the rules

01:12:29.652 --> 01:12:31.110
that we've talked
about previously.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.690
Part of it has to
do with finding

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:36.580
a community of change agents,
and that's very, very critical.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.810
So you need to develop
the new technologies.

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:45.070
You use an island
bridge model to attempt

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:47.860
to get the decision
maker community

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.190
to force your approach
on the overall system.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:53.815
And then to do that
is going to require

01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:55.930
a community of change agents.

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:58.378
And there are communities
of change agents

01:12:58.378 --> 01:12:59.920
that we're starting
to see in energy.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.410
I do think that we are entering
into a very significant energy

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:06.250
innovation wave,
and we can already

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.960
start to see some
of the outlines.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.450
We've seen a fracking
revolution in the United States

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:17.610
that has completely changed
the landscape of US energy

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:22.430
dependency, and
it's very dramatic.

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:25.200
I mean, the entire energy supply
system of the United States

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.330
has been turned upside down--

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:30.650
something which nobody ever
thought was conceivable, right?

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:32.570
And that is a set of
technology advances

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:35.300
that were originally pushed
by several of the energy

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.660
laboratories, developed
that core technologies

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:43.420
behind fracking,
and proceeded to--

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.190
it was implemented over about
a 15-year period as something

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.910
by a wildcat maverick community
in the natural gas sector that

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:53.930
took these technologies up and
worked on implementing them,

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.910
and it really changed things.

01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:58.220
And the United States leads
that technology revolution,

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.800
so we have 100,000-- now
there's a lot of debate

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.920
about a lot of these operations,
the environmental consequences

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.030
of them.

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:10.280
We have about 100,000, roughly,
net fracking operations

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.200
ongoing now in
the United States.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.290
The country closest to us is
China-- it has about 6,000,

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:17.300
all right?

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:21.530
So we have a big lead on that
energy technology revolution.

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:25.190
We have-- we can see--

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.200
solar and wind
now, which are now

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.830
scaling up to trillion-dollar
worldwide energy sectors.

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:33.440
They're going to be
very, very big, right?

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.350
So this revolution is
now starting, right?

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:38.117
The real question for
the US-- and we'll

01:14:38.117 --> 01:14:39.950
talk about this more
later-- is whether it's

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:41.336
going to play, right?

01:14:41.336 --> 01:14:42.878
Whether it's going
to ride this wave.

01:14:46.223 --> 01:14:48.640
MATT: Yeah, it definitely seems
like a theme of the class.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.190
DARPA worked-- let's
try ARPA-E for energy,

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:54.518
or a DARPA-like
funding model for NIH.

01:14:54.518 --> 01:14:56.810
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: But it's
a more complicated process

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:58.140
than just having a DARPA.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.870
DARPA can be a change
agent, but you've

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:02.020
got to get these
steps down too, right?

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:02.930
MATT: Right.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:05.222
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: When you
work on the implementation

01:15:05.222 --> 01:15:06.180
side.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.870
AUDIENCE: Actually,
regarding the ARPA-E.

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:11.663
I notice that DARPA has a
budget of funds like $5 billion?

01:15:11.663 --> 01:15:12.746
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Three.

01:15:12.746 --> 01:15:15.380
AUDIENCE: OK, $3 billion--
whereas ARPA-E has a budget

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:15.950
of--

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:16.940
maybe $100 million?

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.898
Couple hundred million?

01:15:17.898 --> 01:15:19.330
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
$300 million.

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.330
306, Martin, right?

01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:21.705
AUDIENCE: How is
it we can expect

01:15:21.705 --> 01:15:24.260
that ARPA-E is going
to do what DARPA did

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.642
if it has a tenth the budget?

01:15:25.642 --> 01:15:28.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So I want
to save exactly that question

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.020
for our ARPA-E piece.

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:30.800
Is that OK?

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.660
Would you forgive me,
but bring it back?

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.577
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

01:15:33.577 --> 01:15:35.360
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:35.930
How about it?

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:39.150
What else we got, Matt?

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:41.140
MATT: I don't know if
you want to go here,

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.710
but you did mention and
allude to this earlier, that--

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.390
beyond energy like
this is a framework

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:51.350
that can be used for
any legacy sector.

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:53.990
I think a lot of our papers
are applying the framework.

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:59.790
It's interesting to see if
there were any insights into how

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:05.305
it becomes specific to whatever
industry wants [INAUDIBLE]..

01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:07.883
I don't know if you wanted
to move away from energy.

01:16:07.883 --> 01:16:09.800
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's
a very good question,

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.050
and the purpose of our
textbook was really

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:13.940
to take lessons that
we've thought about

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.690
in energy with the
realization-- oh, we

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:20.490
knew energy was a legacy
sector, and we realized--

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:21.380
oh, wait a minute.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.590
Most of the economy
is a legacy sector.

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:27.560
Oh, we came up with this
four step process energy.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.990
Maybe we could think about
that four step process

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:31.600
for a lot of other stuff, too.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.670
That was frankly-- a little
more sophisticated than that,

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:40.060
but that was the essence of our
conceptual realization process.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:44.810
So-- I do think that
these steps here

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.230
are steps that you've got
to think through when you're

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:49.850
innovating in a legacy sector.

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.230
You've got to think about the
different innovation models

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:54.843
you've got, and how to
organize those in new ways,

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:57.260
because all of them are going
to be required in the legacy

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.747
sector-- but you also
have to think about,

01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:01.080
what are your launch categories?

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.360
What are the barriers to launch?

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.235
How are you going to
overcome those barriers?

01:17:04.235 --> 01:17:06.800
What's the right incentive
package and support system?

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.815
Can you do niche launch, which
gets you out of this whole box?

01:17:10.815 --> 01:17:12.690
What are the gaps in
your information system?

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:15.170
I think you've got to
go through all of those

01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:17.895
when you think about legacy
sector innovation in general,

01:17:17.895 --> 01:17:20.270
and we did a little of that
in the health care discussion

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.348
last week.

01:17:22.348 --> 01:17:23.890
AUDIENCE: When I
was looking at this,

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:27.320
I was thinking a lot about edge
cases in computer science--

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.300
like, what if I got the
best product, right?

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.250
And then tried to go
through the framework,

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.960
and see how I would pan it out.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.330
So say like fusion, right?

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:39.460
How would it work out, and
how is the system structured

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.740
to help bring innovation?

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.410
So-- in ideal innovation,
how would it work,

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.027
and how would the dynamics be?

01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:47.860
And then also, a horrible
innovation, right?

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.630
It's really not even innovation.

01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:51.880
I think Tesla got caught on
this, that they were doing

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.130
the same battery technology that
ARPA-E [INAUDIBLE] figured out,

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:56.088
and they're trying to
get government incentives

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:57.270
and go through.

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.900
And so-- that way,
you can figure out--

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.650
this is really not
innovating, but they're

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:02.323
trying to use these resources.

01:18:02.323 --> 01:18:04.240
So I think that was a
really interesting thing

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.040
to maybe try to
do in the future--

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.350
different types of-- because
there's all the categories

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.460
of energy technologies.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.892
What if you try to figure
out the ideal solution,

01:18:11.892 --> 01:18:13.600
and try to push it
through the framework?

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.112
How would they be
able to function?

01:18:15.112 --> 01:18:16.570
Because that way,
you can also find

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:20.530
organizational gaps, like the
politics would not allow it,

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:22.495
or other things.

01:18:22.495 --> 01:18:25.560
I thought it was interesting.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.750
Let's take a brief
look at how to think

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.530
about submitting your
photographs as potential cover

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.260
art in their presentations.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.290
The first thing
that's essential is

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.540
for you to study
the journal layout

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.090
to which you are
submitting your image,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.960
how they might be placed in
a particular cover format.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.790
Most covers these
days are full bleeds.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.010
That is, the image
takes up the whole cover

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.270
and is therefore vertical.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.060
Some of them still have,
let's say, rectangle places

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.810
within the larger
vertical format.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.800
But most of them are
bleeds at this point.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.280
So you have to think
about that when you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940
do submit an idea for a cover.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.980
Think about where the
journal's logo is placed,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150
where additional text
might be dropped.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.260
You have to take all these
things into consideration

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.130
to help the art director decide
whether or not the image is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.290
good enough for a cover.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.370
But I do suggest not submitting
a cover idea with the journal

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.400
logo.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
Just let the folks at the
journal use their imaginations.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.660
Let's start with something
I did fairly recently.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.130
Here I was given a number
of samples of material.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.960
They're all fabricated pieces
that respond differently

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.000
to pressure.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.200
Trying to think of
how in the world

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.360
I was going to come up with
an interesting cover design.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.970
So I decided to play
around with the shapes.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.130
Here I'm using my
flatbed scanner,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.090
and I'm adding a few
pieces here and there

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.120
and finally wound up with
this composition, which

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.780
I thought had the potential
of being considered

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.440
for this particular
journal cover.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.470
And I did digitally add a
gradient to the background,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.170
as you can see.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
In the end, yes, it did make
a cover, which is always nice.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.970
But do keep in mind,
it's not just the image

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.930
that will get you on the cover.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.510
It's the science in the article
that informs the journal's

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.850
selection, maybe some
other things as well,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.820
which none of us are privy to.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.650
So it's not just the
aesthetics, mostly about

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.710
the importance of the research,
which should be the case.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.470
Here's another example,
which you've seen before,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.750
showing the flexible circuitry
imprinted on transparent

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.740
material.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.560
And again, we were delighted to
get the cover of the journal,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.880
probably because of the
importance of the science.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.920
And by the way, that journal
now has another format,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.200
where the cover art takes a
completely different shape

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.820
than what you're seeing here.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.040
So again, it's very important
to match your image's format

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.480
with the journal's format.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.820
For this image, another one
that you've seen before,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.100
it still is one of my favorites
after all these years,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.370
a bit unusual because I
don't usually like old stuff.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.670
But they used it for the cover
of a textbook in chemistry.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.850
After all, this is very,
very much about chemistry.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.210
And notice how they cropped
the image to fit the format.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.250
And of course, I gave
the publisher permission

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.990
to do that.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.030
And here, this image was made
by the researchers hundreds

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.280
of miles from my studio.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.060
But we communicated closely
through email with my making

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.420
suggestions on how to
photograph and light the work.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.070
In this next image, the
researchers shined a laser

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.740
onto the container with
no additional room light,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.380
and we see new
material showing up.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.870
We couldn't see it before
because those balls have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.390
the same index of refraction
as the solution in which they

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.380
were floating.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.120
That's the point
of this research.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.800
The researchers wanted
to show this image

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.290
with a hand in place, suggesting
that the laser is turned off

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.030
ready to be turned on.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.840
And I said, no,
please, no hands.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.070
I believe that hands
generally distract and detract

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.240
from the rest of the image.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.690
It's just another distraction.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.870
Please don't use hands.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.310
So I suggested starting with
the container under a lamp

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.720
as before and then
take another picture

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.180
with just the laser
shining through the lower

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.650
part of the image to
see the hidden material.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.230
So this is the first image,
and this is the second image.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.420
I selected the lower part of
the second image, copied it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.740
and pasted it onto
the first image.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.050
So that we have a sort of photo
illustration, which you're

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.700
going to see more of next week,
in that we will show what it is

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.690
without the laser and what it
is with the laser side by side

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.710
comparing the two with the
information in the caption.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.500
The idea was to make the cover,
and we did, which was nice.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.460
I think it worked well.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.460
You know, some images
look even better

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.420
when they are made into covers
with the addition of text.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.180
They might not be
spectacular on their own,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.070
but often, in my opinion, are
enhanced with well-placed text,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.680
as what happens here.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.450
This is not a very
exciting image that I made.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.730
It's a detail of
equipment that's

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.880
used in this particular lab.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.715
I was delighted that they
liked the abstract quality

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:26.980
of the image and used
it well, in fact,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.710
with good placement of text.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.230
In this image, I was working
on some print material

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.409
for what was then called the
DuPont MIT Alliance, which

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.350
funded research about
bioinspired material.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.600
I made a picture of a
sea urchin, which is

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.310
a fascinating story in itself.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.030
I made it straight on.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.670
I also tried it with
the flatbed scanner.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.200
In the end, the very
talented graphic designer,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.510
he created a pretty stunning
brochure, placed the scanner

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.070
image on the cover,
and it worked well

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.030
in terms of the whole
design of the brochure.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.300
And in this image,
which was also

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.420
part of the same
project, a bioreactor

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.040
where liver cells grow in
three-dimensional space,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.980
I did like the
picture as I made it.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.070
But once again, the
graphic designer

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.820
took it to another level,
using the image as is

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.400
and also associating it
on the page with a drawing

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.900
of the same reactor.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.760
A very interesting way of
reinforcing the structure.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.800
For our book No Small Matter,
I made a photograph of beer.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.310
The idea was to consider the
molecular or nanostructure

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.850
of bubbles.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.070
Now, notice that I
included the wall

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.900
of the rectangular container
in the image on the right.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.170
The final cover wrapped the
image around the full book

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.110
and used the container area
as the front book flap,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.030
which I think is kind of cool.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.160
Here's an image
you've seen before,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.220
and here it's used in the title
page of the Chinese version

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.110
of our book No Small Matter.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.830
And here's the American title
page, again just showing you

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.320
how photographs can
be used with text.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.530
Once again, dropping
text, I think,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.700
can make an OK image,
(which this is, of bubbles),

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.160
into a more interesting cover.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.460
The left side is the back
cover of this booklet.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.640
I think that worked pretty well.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.390
And this photograph is a
straight, highly documentary

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.130
image showing the presence
of material in an assay.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.760
And I simply used the image
in a more expanded idea

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.230
for a cover illustratively
giving more information

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.730
about the material.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.840
I don't use Illustrator very
often, but in this case,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.900
it seemed to work.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.170
And finally, here's
another image

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.590
you've seen before,
used both as a cover

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.010
and back cover for
an MIT publication.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.980
I was quite pleased that the
image I made 15 years ago still

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.950
had a life, frankly because of
the importance of nanocrystal,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.660
or quantum dot science.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.350
Yeah, the picture was good,
but the science is even better.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.850
If you are lucky to work
with researchers whose work

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.850
is timeless, then
your photographs

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.820
might become timeless as
well, if you are lucky.

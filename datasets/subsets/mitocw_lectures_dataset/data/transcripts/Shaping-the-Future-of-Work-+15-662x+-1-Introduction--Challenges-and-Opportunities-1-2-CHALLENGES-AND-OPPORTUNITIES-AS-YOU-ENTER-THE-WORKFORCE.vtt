WEBVTT

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.300
We're speaking today
with Tom Perez,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.680
the Secretary of Labor
for the United States

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.660
Department of Labor.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.710
So thank you, Mr.
Secretary, for joining us.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.275
Oh, it's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:15.650
Maybe you could
talk a little bit

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.950
about what's changed
since you and I

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.460
entered the labor force
a number of years ago.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
I'm thinking about a
good friend of mine

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.190
whose dad graduated
high school, went

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.490
to work at Bethlehem Steel,
and worked there for 42 years.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.740
And as we fast
forward to today, it

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.610
is much less frequent to
see someone at a job for 30,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.520
40 years like our
parents' generation.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.390
And once again, you look in
the world of manufacturing

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.020
just to take one example.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.050
The jobs of today are quite
different than the jobs

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.990
of yesterday.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.190
And frankly, in many
cases, a high school degree

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.760
simply won't suffice.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.180
And so my parents
always taught me

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.020
education is the
great equalizer.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.240
It's what made
America a superpower.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.030
This commitment to free public
elementary and secondary

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.220
education, and today we need
to keep that investment.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.740
Maybe we could focus on some
of the current challenges

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.910
and opportunities.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.690
We're coming out of
this great recession,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.720
the worst since the
Great Depression.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.770
The economy's been growing, but
not everyone is sharing equally

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.340
in benefits of the growth.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.590
What accounts for
where we are today?

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.327
Well, it's always important
to look at where we were,

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:32.910
where we are, and
where we need to go.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.190
The rising tide of progress
in the late '90s that we saw

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070
lifted more boats.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.440
Today, that rising tide
isn't lifting as many boats

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.690
as it needs to.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.880
We need to make sure that
everybody has that chance,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.370
and one of the biggest
challenges in this context

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.130
is addressing the issue of
stubbornly stagnant wages.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.320
And that's not
simply a phenomenon

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.380
of the great recession.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.790
For decades, productivity
growth and real wage growth

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.380
rose hand in hand.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.410
And then starting around
1980, that began to change.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.340
And we see productivity
increases of over 90%

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.170
and real wage
growth of 2% or 3%.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.880
And that's unfair to workers.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
Workers have helped bake
the pie of prosperity,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.000
but their sweat equity
hasn't translated

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.950
into financial equity for them.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.820
And so too many people haven't
gotten a raise in years.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.310
Too many people are
working two, three jobs.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.140
One of the best family
values is the value

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.750
of time spent with your
family, and folks just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.480
don't have enough
time to do that.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.030
We could talk a little bit,
perhaps, about how we can get

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.110
wages and high quality jobs
moving in the right direction.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.550
And I know you are
an ardent advocate

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.610
for the administration--

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.690
for the country-- about the
importance of skills and skill

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.380
development.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.120
I wonder if you could say
what your thoughts are

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.070
on what workers might do and
what kind of opportunities

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.480
we need to provide for workers
to keep those skills current so

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.680
that people can adapt over time.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.810
You look at the data and
the education dividend

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.050
is undeniable.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.690
The more education you have,
the greater the chances

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.390
are that you can punch your
ticket to the middle class

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.500
and then stay there.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.440
It's important to
recognize that there

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.760
are multiple educational
pathways to the middle class.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.690
Some people graduate
high school and go

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.530
to college, but other people--

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.180
especially when I was growing
up in Buffalo-- a lot of folks

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.060
went through the
apprenticeship route.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.470
And that route, if you go
to places like Germany,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.150
has equal stature with
the four-year route.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.680
And here in America,
we've devalued

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.490
that over the course
of recent decades.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.070
And that's why this
president, and we

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.320
at the Department of Labor,
are trying to change that.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.450
And I've met so many folks who
have completed apprenticeship

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.960
programs, whether it's the
traditional skilled trades,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.140
whether it's IT, whether
it's in the health sectors.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.940
These are alternative
pathways to higher ed,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.000
and many of these
folks who complete

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.244
apprenticeships then get
an associate's degree

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:12.660
at a community college and
then go to a four-year college.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.870
So it's important
as people think

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.500
about that pathway to upscaling
to recognize that there are

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.610
multiple entry
points, and they all

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.070
lead to core competencies
that enable you to compete

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.290
and thrive, not only
in today's economy,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.150
but in tomorrow's economy.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.940
Well, I think your
work on apprenticeships

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.950
is so important because
the evidence is so

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.020
clear on how well they pay off.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.460
For every dollar we
invest in apprenticeship,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.100
the return is
something like $27.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.810
I wish every investment we
made had that kind of return.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.950
One of the concepts that
we use in this course

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.270
is the term social
contract, and you've

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.860
been an articulate
proponent of a strong voice

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.290
for the American workforce.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.290
I wonder if you could speak
a bit about the role of voice

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.020
in our economy, and
what it means to workers

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.100
and what it means
to our society.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.440
It's not a coincidence in
my mind that the periods

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.150
in our nation's history-- in
the 20th century for instance--

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.740
where you had decade after
decade of real wage growth

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.410
didn't just coincide but
coexisted with a period of time

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.000
where workers had
a collective voice.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.510
Where you had much
higher union density.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.860
Where people could advocate.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.270
America's greatest
generation who

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.300
fought in World War II--
millions of them came home,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.820
and what did they do?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.650
They worked
collectively once again

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.450
in the workplace to
fight for fair wages.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.040
And what we I think have
lost today is too many

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.360
folks have bought into
this false choice of you

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.640
either take care
of your shareholder

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.120
or you take care of your
worker, but you can't do both.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.630
I categorically reject that,
and it is indeed a false choice.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.100
You look at places
like the Ford Motor

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.490
Company, an existential
crisis in the great recession.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.480
And what happened?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.160
The UAW and Ford got
together around a plan

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.990
of shared sacrifice leading
to shared prosperity.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.740
So I visited a plant in
Louisville, Kentucky,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.200
that makes the Ford Escape.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.270
And in 2007, they were
down to about 700 workers.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.770
They weren't sure
if they were going

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.500
to shutter the plant entirely.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.990
And as a result of
that cooperation,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.460
you see shared sacrifice
leading to shared prosperity.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.800
And today, they're 4,400
employees and growing,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.930
and that doesn't include
the supply chain.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.380
So when the workers have
a voice, America succeeds.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.690
There are many ways to
give voice to workers.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.940
Unions are certainly one way.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.600
There are also a
number of nonprofits

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.610
that are working with taxicab
drivers and home health

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.540
workers and fast food workers.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.740
Nonprofits that are very
agile, and they're really

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.540
standing up for low wage
workers trying to give voice.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.760
There are a lot of
headwinds in this issue.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.240
There are courts
right now that are

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.100
hostile to efforts to organize.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.000
There's hostile
state legislatures

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.370
right now that are making it
hard for public sector workers

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.780
to move forward.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.780
There are well-heeled
multi-billionaires

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.300
who are spending a lot of
money trying to muzzle voice.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.010
But these forces
existed 100 years ago.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.780
We've defeated these before.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.660
The arc of the moral
universe has always

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.330
bent toward justice
and toward those

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.500
who seek to expand opportunity.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.530
But it doesn't bend on its own.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.290
I'm wondering if you
would like to conclude

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.600
with your own advice for the
next generation workforce.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.180
First of all, I think education
is the great equalizer.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.500
So you want to make sure that
you have the skills to compete

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.670
today and tomorrow.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.850
Secondly, you need
to find your passion.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.820
Happiest is the person whose
job is his or her hobby

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.250
because then you never have
to work a day in your life.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.750
Third, you need to reject
these false choices of those

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.590
who suggest that if you burn
out your neighbor's candle,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.830
that will make your
candle shine brighter.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.910
That's never been who
we are as a nation.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.360
We've always been a community
recognizing that we all succeed

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.610
only when we all succeed.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.490
We rise and fall on the
strength of our middle class

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.750
and the strength of our
ladders of opportunity

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.830
to the middle class.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.400
And so I want everyone-- all
your students-- to make sure

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.240
they understand that
opportunities abound.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.919
And low wages and
no benefits are

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.549
a choice that
companies make, not

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:47.960
a necessity born out of
globalization or technology

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.900
advances.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.720
These are choices.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.330
And you need to make that choice
as a student to get involved

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.840
and to exert leadership.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.680
Well, a very, very powerful
statement, Mr. Secretary.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.610
Thank you for all you
do and for everyone

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.340
here at the Department of Labor
does for the current generation

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.440
workforce, and for
all of those to come.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.410
Well, it's an honor.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.340
Take care.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.280
Thanks again.

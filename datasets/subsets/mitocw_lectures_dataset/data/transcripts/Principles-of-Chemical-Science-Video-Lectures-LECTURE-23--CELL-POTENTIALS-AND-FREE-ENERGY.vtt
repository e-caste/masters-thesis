00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Today I will begin by talking
about a subject that we were

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
just getting to at the end of
class last time,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that will be electrolysis.
And this is an interesting

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
topic.
One of the examples of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
electrolysis that is commonly
used is that which forms the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
basis for the so-called Dow
process.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here, what I am representing is
a container.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And a container that would be
used to house molten magnesium

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
chloride.
If you take magnesium chloride,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which is a typical salt,
and get it hot enough,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
then it will become liquid.
And when it becomes liquid in

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the melt, what you can do is
carry out a non-spontaneous

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
reaction by applying an external
voltage.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So, the idea is that this is
some source of a potential

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
difference.
And you can take a positive

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
electrode and a negative
electrode and immerse it into

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the melt.
And if the potential is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
sufficiently great,
you can force a non-spontaneous

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
reaction to run,
because overall,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the reaction will be
spontaneous when you factor in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the potential difference of the
external source.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And, in this particular case,
the reaction that would be

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
taking place is as follows.
At one side we would have

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
magnesium two plus
ions being reduced to,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
at this temperature,
liquid elemental magnesium.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, metallic magnesium at one
electrode.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And, at the same time,
at the other electrode,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
what would be taking place is
the oxidation of chloride ions,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
two of which counterbalance the
magnesium two plus

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in the salt magnesium
dichloride.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And we put in a couple of
electrons.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Sorry, we are oxidizing
chloride to Cl two,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which would be bubbling out as
a gas at the temperatures of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
this melt.
You initially would have this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
molten salt.
You would immerse your two

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
electrodes.
You would apply an external

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
potential.
And if that potential is great

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
enough, then these two reactions
start taking place at the two

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
electrodes.
And you can see that in order

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for this to happen,
chloride is being oxidized.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And so we can see then that
this must be the source of the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
positive electrode and electrons
will be going this way and going

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
down here.
And when they collect in this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
electrode on the left,
they are used to reduce

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
magnesium two plus
to liquid magnesium.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So, that is an electrolysis
reaction in which something that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
does not want to happen,
namely the reduction of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
magnesium two plus
to magnesium zero by chloride

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
ions, that is non-spontaneous.
And we are forcing it to happen

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
by applying this external
potential.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And just how great must that
external potential be?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Well, Christine,
could you locate for me on the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
table, there,
the potential for magnesium two

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
plus plus two electrons going to
magnesium

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and the potential for
Cl two plus two electrons going

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to two Cl minus?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Note that our standard
potentials that we defined last

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
time, relative to the standard
hydrogen electrode,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
are always written as reduction
potentials by convention.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
What is it here?
Can we zoom in on it?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Zoom in our finger.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Okay.
By the way, I had her do this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in part because I wanted to draw
your attention to this table

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that is in one of the appendices
of the textbook.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, it is in the back.
There is an abbreviated form of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
this table right in Chapter 12,
which you should be reading.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But when you want to find a
standard potential that is not

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in that abbreviated table,
you will now know that you can

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
go to your appendix to find that
reduction potential.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Christine, please read out to
me the value for the chloride.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Is that the one that you have
there?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
+1.36.
Okay.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And this is positive of the
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
showing you that Cl two
is an oxidizing substance.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then what about the
magnesium plus two

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
electrons?
-2.36.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Remember I mentioned last time
that elemental sodium was around

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
-2.7 volts, so it was a very
strong reducing agent,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
magnesium.
It is also a very strong

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
reducing agent.
Chlorine is an oxidant,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
so clearly the direction of
spontaneity in this system is

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
for a magnesium metal to be
reducing Cl two to make

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
chloride ions.
And that is why the form of the

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
salt that Henry Dow as a young
man was extracting from the

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
briny marshes near his home in
Michigan, and later founded the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Dow company on the basis of
chemistries like this.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
That is how you found it,
as magnesium two plus,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
2 Cl minus.
And so, overall,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
if you reverse the sign of the
anode reaction and add it to the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
cathode reaction,
you are going to see that this

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
one is downhill,
sorry, is non-spontaneous by an

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
absolute magnitude of 3.72
volts, which is the difference

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
between these two values,
this absolute difference in

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
potential.
That means that we are going to

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
have to apply an external
voltage of greater than 3.72

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
volts, positive,
in order to get this thing to

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
run and to be able to get
gaseous Cl two bubbling

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
out and in order to get liquid
molten magnesium to be formed

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and separating from the molten
magnesium chloride.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
That is a large external
potential.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
That is the price that you have
to pay to make this

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
non-spontaneous reaction go.
And that is the minimum price.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000
If we could just briefly switch
to the Athena from the document

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
camera.
I want to mention this one

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
word, overpotential.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You will see an explicit
definition of the word

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
overpotential given in my notes
and in your book,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
but what overpotential is,
in fact, a number.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And it is the amount of voltage
that is greater than this

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
non-spontaneous cell potential
that you have to apply in order

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
for the reaction really to start
kicking in and working.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
In practice,
you choose maybe a couple

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
platinum electrodes,
and you dip them into the thing

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
that you want to electrolyze,
and you apply an external

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
potential.
And, in practice,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that external potential is
something much greater than the

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
cell voltage of interest.
And sometimes it is even a

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
large amount in excess.
And the reason has to do with

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the barrier to the reaction,
that is introduced by the way

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that it takes place at the
interface on the surface of

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
these electrodes,
so you have to apply some

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
overpotential.
That is energy that you have to

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
put into the system over and
above the inherent energy of the

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
electrolysis to make it actually
work in practice.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And so, the substance that we
would most like to be able to

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
electrolyze is water.
Because, if you think about it,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
electrolysis of water would
produce hydrogen and oxygen.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And then we could have those in
our fuel tank,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and we can go ahead and let
combustion take place,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
which produces what?
It would produce water.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
You would get a beautiful
complete cycle,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
if you could do a good job of
electrolyzing water into its

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
components, H two and O
two.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And the reason that that is
difficult is because you have to

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
put in energy,
somehow, in order to make that

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
non-spontaneous reaction go
uphill.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We would like to make that the
basis for the hydrogen economy.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I really love Iceland.
This is my favorite country,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I think.
Although, I have never been

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
there.
And it is, because they do this

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
reaction.
They do this electrolysis of

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
water every night,
so that they will have hydrogen

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and oxygen for combustion
purposes the next day in their

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
buses in the city.
And they are actually doing

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
this.
And why are they able to do

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that?
Well, their special location on

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
the planet gives them a lot of
free electricity that they can

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
use to run the electrolysis of
water to make hydrogen and

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
oxygen every night.
And then they can combust that

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in their buses.
And you essentially have free

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
hydrogen, and it is not a
problem.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And in places like Iceland or
other places in the world,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
where you have freely available
energy from geothermal sources

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
or from hydroelectric power,
then you can do that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You can use that energy,
that electricity that is free,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that the earth is just giving
you, to go ahead and carry out

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the electrolysis of water and
make hydrogen that way.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And we would like to be able to
do that using photochemistry.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
One possible way to get the
positive holes in the electrons

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
apart is to use h nu.
A photon can impinge on a

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
material and lead to the
separation of charge in what is

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
called a photovoltaic device.
And, if you can interface a

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
photovoltaic device to a couple
of electrodes that have surfaces

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that are appropriate,
chemically, for minimizing the

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
overpotential,
then you can use light coming

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
in from the sun to make
electrolysis of water happen to

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
get hydrogen and oxygen from
light that is coming in incident

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
on the earth.
And so, one thing that is

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
currently ongoing research in a
partnership at Caltech and MIT,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and I am involved with this,
this is Professor Nocera,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
here.
And you will see this furry

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
face walking around the hallways
at MIT.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And he is an amazing guy.
And if he does what he is

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
trying to do right,
he is probably going to be the

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
next one in our department to
win the Nobel Prize.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So, Professor Nocera is
currently the professor of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
chemistry and professor of
energy here at MIT.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
He is the energy professor.
And he is a lot more voluble

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and vigorous,
I think, than I am.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
He is really bouncing off the
walls with energy.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And that is good because the
technical challenges that we

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
have to surmount in order to be
able to use sunlight to carry

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
out water oxidation,
water electrolysis are very

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
great, but they come down to
chemistry and to molecules.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And starting on Wednesday,
we are going to enter a part of

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
the semester in which we treat
the subject of bonding in

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
chemistry in quite a bit of
detail.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We are going to be talking
about molecular orbitals and

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
things like that.
And if you get a good

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
understanding of molecular
orbital theory and electronic

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
structure and the shapes of
molecules, you may be able to

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
contribute to this problem by
helping to design molecules that

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
can go on the surface of the
electrodes.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And the purpose of those
molecules is to reduce the

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
overpotential for water
electrolysis with sunlight as

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the source of the electrons and
the holes.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And this man's entire life is
defined by one number,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and that is the overpotential.
We are making electrode

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
molecules that will bring down
the overpotential and give us a

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
free source of clean energy from
water.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
One week from today,
you are going to have a little

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
introduction to undergraduate
research here at MIT.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We are going to have some
visitors who will come in and

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
talk to you about the 5
subject that is given during

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
IAP.
And the people who successfully

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
complete the 5.301 subject are
then guaranteed a position in a

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
research laboratory in chemistry
as an undergraduate research

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
opportunities program student.
If you want to get involved in

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the molecular chemistry of
renewable energy,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
then you might want to make
sure you are here on time for

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
class on Monday,
and you will get that

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
introduction.
And you can think about what to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
do in terms of 5.301.
Now, I want to bring you up to

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
speed on some more important
concepts that pertain to

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
electrochemistry.
Let's talk about electrical

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
work.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Here, I want to make an analogy
to the way that electrons can do

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
work when they fall through a
potential difference and

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
experience a potential
difference.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I want to make an analogy
between that and the way that

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
things go downhill by virtue of
the force of gravity.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And so, you can think of a
waterfall of electrons flowing

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
from a place of high potential
to a place of low potential if

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
you want to get an idea for our
expression for the way that the

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
free energy of reaction is
related to electrical work.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And it is the total charge that
is passed multiplied by the

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
potential difference through
which the charge is passing.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We have been talking about this
potential difference and calling

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
it E.
And if it is standard

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
potential, then we will use the
superscript zero,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
or the little degree symbol for
a standard.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And now, we want to know what
is the total charge?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It is going to be negative n
times the charge on the electron

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
times N sub A,
which is Avogadro's number.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And we are going to be
interested in getting the total

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
charge expressed in terms of a
quantity per mole.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Actually, we are going to
express it in Coulombs per mole.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And so, we combine e and (N)A
together.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And this is one of our
fundamental constants.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
This is Faraday's constant.
And you will remember that that

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
is approximately 96,485.3
Coulombs per mole.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
That is Faraday's constant.
And we will use that as our way

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
of expressing charge here.
And so, we get the important

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
expression, delta Gr is equal to
negative nFE.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And we will use that a couple

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
of times today in getting access
to other quantities.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And what is n?
That is going to be the

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
stoichiometric number of
electrons passed in the

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
half-reaction of interest.
I will show you a couple of

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
examples of how you figure out
what n is in this expression.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
So, it is the total charge
times the potential difference.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
One of the things that this is
useful for is for finding a

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
relationship between an
equilibrium constant and a

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
standard cell potential.
And we can do that by recalling

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
from chemical equilibrium the
expression that delta G is equal

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
to minus RT ln K.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And now we have a new
expression, down here,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
for delta G.
And let's go ahead and insert

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:30.000
that, and we will see that nFE
is going to be equal to RT ln K.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And so, we can just rearrange
that and solve for quantity of

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
interest here.
We are going to see that the

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
equilibrium constant,
K, is equal to an exponential

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
of nFE divided by RT. And

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
this should be for a standard
potential.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And then this is the
equilibrium constant,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
that special value of Q that
applies when the system is at

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
equilibrium.
So, let me put the little

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
superscript up here to make it
clear that we are talking here

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
about a standard potential.
The idea is then if you have a

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
reaction and you can express it
in terms of half-reactions,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
then you can go to our table in
the appendix,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
if those half-reactions happen
to be in the table.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And then you can calculate the
value of the standard potential

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
for the cell that would be
comprised of those two

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
half-reactions,
as we described last time.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And then, given these other
quantities, we can calculate the

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
equilibrium constant for the
reaction.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So, it is a useful thing to be
able to do.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
You take a standard cell
potential and then take a

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
temperature like the standard
temperature, 298.15K.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And you have your value of F
that I gave you.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And you can look up,
of course, the value for the

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
gas constant.
And you have n,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
from the stoichiometry of the
number of electrons passing

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
through this potential
difference.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And then you can get K.
And you see that this

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
equilibrium constant K goes up
exponentially as the standard

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
cell potential increases.
That is quite an interesting

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
relationship,
too.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And I would like to give you an
example of how we can use this.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Let's consider a possible
reaction of this sort.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
This reaction,
of course, as you would see in

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
the table of standard reduction
potentials, is assumed to be

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
taking place in dilute aqueous
solution.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Actually, if it is in a
standard state,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
the concentrations of the ions
will be taken to be 1.0 molar,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
which is the standard
concentration.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
One thing that I regret about
my lecture on Friday and about

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
my lecture today is that I am
not really talking too much

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
about molecules and molecular
shapes and what these things

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
actually look like in solution.
But normally,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
when you have metal or
metalloid ions dissolved in

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
aqueous solution,
there is some number of water

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
molecules that are interacting
directly with the metal ions.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It is just not a so-called
naked metal ion,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
but it is bonded to water
molecules in solution.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And this is through the type of
Lewis acid, Lewis base chemistry

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
that we talked about earlier.
There would really be some

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
number of water molecules bonded
here.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And we will look at so-called
coordination complexes in quite

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
a bit more detail in the
upcoming section on chemical

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
bonding, but this is how you
will find it typically written

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
in a book.
And that is not representative

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
of the structure in solution,
which you do need to know in

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
order to have a little bit of an
understanding of the system.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
And we are going to consider
the possibility that indium may

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
react with uranium to provide
indium two plus.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
We are going from trivalent to
divalent indium.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And the source of that electron
is the uranium three plus

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
ion going to the
uranium four plus ion.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
There is a hypothetical

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
reaction that we want to
consider.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And we are going to need to be
able to express that in terms of

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
half-reactions.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And one of these half-reactions
is simply indium two plus

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
plus the electron.
Sorry, indium three plus plus

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
an electron going to indium two
plus.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And, similarly,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
over here, we have uranium
three plus.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I am writing both of these as
reductions, as you will find

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
them in the table.
Four plus, plus an electron,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
going to uranium three plus.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Those are our two
half-reactions.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Christine, can you zero in on
them?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Yes, you are doing that
already.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Thank you.
-0.49 for indium.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
And then, when we look at
uranium, these are arranged

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
alphabetically.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Here they are in alphabetical
order.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
In the tables they can be
arranged by potential or they

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
can be arranged alphabetically.
Sometimes it is easier to find

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
a potential by taking advantage
of alphabetization.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
And so, if we can focus in on
that --

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
We focus in on that,
and you will see that the 4+

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
going to the 3+ is -0.61.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And then you will remember that
to find the standard cell

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
potential, E zero of the
cell is going to be equal to E

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
zero of the cathode minus E zero
of the anode.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And what we can see here is
that this reaction is going to

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
proceed spontaneously as written
because in going from left to

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
right, as written,
uranium plus three is going to

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
plus four.
So, uranium is the reducing

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
agent.
And it is a stronger reducing

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
agent than the other possible
reducing agent,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
indium two plus,
because it is more negative

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
than the indium two plus.
And how much more negative is

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
it?
It is more negative by +0.12

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
volts.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And we, therefore,
because this cell potential is

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
positive, we know that this
reaction is spontaneous as

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
written.
And it is positive by 0.12

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
volts.
That is a spontaneous reaction.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And now we have all the
information that we would need

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
in order to get the equilibrium
constant for this reaction.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
We know that,
in terms of standard potential,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
it is 0.12.
Let's see, here,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
if we can just calculate this.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
All right.
I am going to take this and

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
zoom it a little bit.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.000
We are going to put in
Faraday's constant of 96,485.3,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:46.000
and also we are going to need
the gas constant.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Everyone remember the value of
the gas constant,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
8.31447?
And now, if we look over at our

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
relationship between the
equilibrium constant and the

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
free energy over there.
We took a free energy and we

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
converted it into a standard
cell potential.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Now we have it,
so we want to solve for an

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
exponential of nFE.
n is one here because,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
in both cases,
we have one electron being

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
transferred in the
half-reaction.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000
We have the exponential of F
times 0.12.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And then, that is divided by
RT.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
And so we have R times 298.15
K.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And let me just make sure I get
back over here and get another

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
parenthesis in there and see
what it is.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Our equilibrium constant,
for that reaction,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
with a separation for the
standard cell potential of only

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
0.12 volts, is about 106.
The equilibrium constant says

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
that the concentration of these
ions multiplied together divided

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
by the concentration of these
ions multiplied together is

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
based on the information
contained in the half-cell

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
potentials.
So, that was pretty cool.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And we will now go ahead and
talk about another relationship

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
that we can get.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Over there, I was able to give
you that relationship between

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
the equilibrium constant and
standard cell potential by

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
remembering something from
chemical equilibrium.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
And now, we are going to do
that again.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And we are going to remember
that delta G for a reaction is

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
equal to delta G nought plus RT
ln Q.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
That is something that

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
you should remember from your
studies of chemical equilibrium.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And the neat thing now is we
know we have another

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
relationship for the free energy
of a reaction that is related to

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
electrical work.
We got that up there.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Now we can go,
minus nFE.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Notice that what we are going
here is we are considering what

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
happens when we perturb a system
from equilibrium conditions.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And when might that happen?
Well, I showed you how to set

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
up a Galvanic cell last time,
and I showed you how to

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
calculate its standard cell
potential.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
You could measure the standard
cell potential by using,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
externally, a volt meter.
And, as long as you did not let

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
the reaction proceed to any
significant extent,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
then you would know the
standard potential for that

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
cell.
And what we are going to do now

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
is we are going to say,
let's let the reaction proceed.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Let's let a battery become
discharged, for example.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And, as the reaction is
proceeding, we might want,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
for example,
to be able to make a plot of

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
the potential at any particular
extent of a reaction.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And, in order to do that,
we will develop this equation,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
here, that shows how the
potential at any particular

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
point along the reaction going
to completion is related to the

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
standard potential.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And all I have done now is
substitute minus nFE

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
and minus nFE zero
in, respectively,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
for delta G and delta G zero
for the

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
reaction.
And now I want to go through

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
and divide by minus nF.
And when I do that,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I am going to get E is equal to
E zero minus (RT over nF) ln Q.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And this equation is very

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
central to electrochemistry.
It is the Nernst equation.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
And you will be able to use the
Nernst equation to predict how

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.000
systems will behave when they
are perturbed from equilibrium.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
And one example would be that
of a battery discharge,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
like I was mentioning a moment
ago.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And so, let's kind of pick some
arbitrary material,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
out of which to make a battery.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
And we will use the Nernst
equation to get information

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
about how it will discharge.
And let's consider the

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
following cell.
It will be one in which the two

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
half-reactions are as follows.
Iron two plus plus two

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.000
electrons going to Fe metal.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And the other material will be
cadmium two plus plus two

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
electrons going to cadmium
metal.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Now we need the two standard

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
reduction potentials for iron
two plus,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
--

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
-- which is coordinated in
aqueous solution to six water

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
molecules in an octahedral
array, but we will get to that

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
later.
And I can see the equation but

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
not the value.
And there it is at -0.44.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
And now we need cadmium two
plus going to

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
cadmium, elemental form.
And we see that it is up there

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
at -0.40.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Both cadmium metal and iron
metal are negative of the

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
standard hydrogen electrode.
They are both reducing systems,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
as it were.
However, we see that iron is

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
more negative.
And, since iron is more

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
negative, if we set the cell up,
if we have a piece of cadmium

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
on one side and a piece of iron
on the other side in this cell,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
then this piece of iron metal
is going to be providing the

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
electrons in this system,
when we go in the spontaneous

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
direction.
The electron flow in the

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
external circuit will be from
the iron metal electrode to the

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
cadmium metal electrode.
And things happen in solution,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
as we've discussed,
but that makes iron the anode.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
And for the reaction going that
way, as we would have set it up,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
then we have a standard cell
potential E zero of +0.04 volts.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And now, in order to apply the

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Nernst equation to answer a
question about this battery --

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
and this battery is not a
high-voltage battery,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
it is only 0.04 volts,
not high-voltage at all,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
so you probably would not use
it for a battery,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
unless you really only needed a
small potential difference in

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
the first place -- but,
nonetheless,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
we want to know how we can use
the Nernst equation.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:18.000
We can say, what is E at 80%
completion?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
That is the type of question we
can answer using the Nernst

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
equation.
What is the potential drop to

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
from an initial positive 0.04
volts when the reaction is 80%

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
complete?
Under standard conditions,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
we have one molar solution on
both sides of the ions.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So, in this solution,
we would have 1.0 molar candium

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
two plus,
and over here,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
in this solution, we have
1.0 molar Fe two plus.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Because those are the standard

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
conditions, as you will see
written in the header to that

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
long table in your appendix,
because you have to define

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
standard conditions in order to
have a standard potential.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And the standard conditions are
1.0 molar of the ions,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
respectively,
in solution.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
At 80% completion,
what will happen is we will

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
have gone in terms of producing
iron two ions in

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
solution.
We are producing them in

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
solution as the electrons flow
through the external circuit

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
because the piece of iron metal
is the anode.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
And so, what we are interested
in here is Q.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
I am writing backwards.
Pretty soon I will be writing

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
straight down or sideways.
In the reaction,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
as written in the forward
direction, we are producing Fe

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
two plus ions such
that we can define our Q at this

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
80% completion value as 1.8
molar divided by 0.2 molar.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And that is equal to,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
of course, just nine.
Q is equal to nine.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
We have RT, that will be 298.15
Kelvin.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
RF is our number of Coulombs
per mole.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
That is the Faraday constant.
And, in this case,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
because in the half-reactions,
you have two electrons rather

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
than one being transferred,
n is equal to two.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
If you plug in now,
you have E zero is 0.04 and you

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
have RT over nF ln of 9,
that will give you the

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
potential at 80% completion,
which is somewhere in between

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
0.04 and zero,
as this battery is discharged.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
If you want to model the way in
which a battery is discharged,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
you can use the Nernst equation
for that purpose.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But, there is another type of
cell that is interesting,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
that you can also describe very
well using the Nernst equation.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
This will be what is called a
concentration cell.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Concentration cells are pretty
neat.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
In a concentration cell you set
up a potential difference with

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
the same electrode materials on
both sides, just different

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
concentrations.
If I were writing this in terms

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
of the type of diagram I used
last time, I could show you that

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
we could connect two beakers
with a salt bridge like that and

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
we could have electrode
materials here dipping into

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
solution on both sides.
And, in solution on one side,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
we are going to have Sn two
plus,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
divalent tin ions,
at a concentration of 0.01

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
molar.
And, on the other side,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000
we will have Sn two plus
at a concentration

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
of 0.10 molar.
This one on the left is dilute

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000
by a factor of ten.
That one is the more dilute one

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
by a factor of ten.
And we can ask what kind of a

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
voltage is set up as a
consequence of just simply

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000
having different concentrations
of tin ions in the two beakers.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And we can ask in which
direction the electrons would

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
flow in a system like this.
Well, in this reaction,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
the system wants to go from a
state where tin two plus ions at

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
0.10 molar
go to the beaker where we have

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Sn two plus ions at 0.01 molar.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
We have a potential setup here
that is similar to the way

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
osmosis takes place.
The ions want to move from a

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
region of high concentration to
a region of low concentration.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And the system would come to
equilibrium at that time when

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
the concentration is the same on
both sides.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And then there would no longer
be any potential.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
The value of E nought for this
cell is equal to zero,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
because we have the same
half-reactions that would take

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
place on both sides.
So, E nought is equal to zero

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
volts in the concentration cell.
And which way do electrons go?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Well, here is how you can think
of it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
The electrode material can be
made out of tin on both sides.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And, since tin ions are going
to appear in solution on the

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
dilute side, they are going to
jump into solution from the

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
electrode itself.
A tin atom that is a piece of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
the metal on the surface of the
electrode will jump into

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
solution, increasing the
concentration of tin two plus

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
on the dilute side.
And, every time it does that,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
we get two electrons racing
through the external circuit,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
going over here,
where those two electrons can

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
be used to reduce tin two
ions in solution

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
that become a new tin atom on
the surface of the electrode on

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
the right-hand side.
That is physically what happens

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
to equilibrate the concentration
of tin ions on both sides as a

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
function of time.
And so, what we can find is

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:41.000
that these two values of the
concentrations go into

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
determining our Q in the
following way.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
We have Q of 0.1.
Because the tin ions are going

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
from a place of high
concentration to a place of low

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
concentration,
and electrons are traveling

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
through the external circuit
defining the cathode and the

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
anode in the direction that I
mentioned, the electrons are

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
coming out over here.
So, the dilute side is going to

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
be your anode.
And we have n equal to two,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
in this particular case,
because it is a two electron

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
process that converts tin two
plus into metallic

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
tin.
You can take these numbers and

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
plug them into the Nernst
equation.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
And where you have E nought is
equal to zero,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
n is equal to two,
T would be 298.15.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
We know the Faraday constant
and the gas constant.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
We have Q is equal to 0.1,
which is our concentration

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
ratio between the two sides.
And, when we solve that,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
we are going to find that some
small voltage is produced

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
initially at this set of
concentrations.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
I hope that in the last couple
of lectures, today and last

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Friday, I have hammered home the
relationship between

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
electrochemistry and energy.
And next time we will go

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
forward in talking about
molecular structure and see how

00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:38.000
that is going to play a role.

WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
I'm just going

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.950
to go very quickly through
the World Economic Forum.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.190
I only wanted you all to glance
at this and get an idea of it,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.140
because what it's in here
for is to show that we're not

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.660
the only ones trying to think
about innovation factors,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.900
right.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.317
They are trying
to figure out what

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:40.730
these factors are as they assess
different national economies.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.550
They have a whole global
competitiveness rating

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.170
system, which they get
out every other year.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.250
So in 2015, 2016, as
you saw, Switzerland

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.840
was number one,
Singapore number two,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.780
and the US was number
three in their rating.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.590
And then they have a
whole series of elements

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.310
that they consider in their
global competitiveness

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.980
analysis.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.620
So they look at what they
call factor-driven economies,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.010
and the pillars there are
institutions and infrastructure

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.640
and macroeconomic
environment and actually

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.550
early-stage education
as a pillar in health.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.080
And then efficiency-driven
economies, they call them--

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.220
that's higher education, that's
market efficiency for goods,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.980
that's labor market
efficiency, that's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.400
financial market developments,
technology readiness, and so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.900
forth.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.760
And then innovation-driven
economies,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.910
business sophistication,
and innovation capability.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.890
So they have a very
different mix here.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.170
I just wanted to throw in
kind of a comparative way

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.570
of other people
looking at the problems

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.420
that we're talking about,
and the kind of pillars

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.010
that they come
about, and how they

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.960
sort different kind of world
economies and organize them.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.540
But a lot of these factors
we've just been talking about.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.330
Kind of the core,
I think, of what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.240
the takeaway is from this
study, and let me get--

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.490
you also had Rycroft,
Lily, as well,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.590
so why don't I get Rycroft
out on the table too.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.540
That's Bob Rycroft and Kash.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.450
They did this
piece back in 1999.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.620
And I'm leading in to how do
you look at some of these more

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.220
indirect innovation factors?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.320
Because they remain
important, and we're just

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320
going to pick three.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.820
And you know they're looking
at a kind of an element

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.460
of innovation organization,
which I think is a core factor,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.340
but they're talking about
kind of a sub-piece of it,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.930
this kind of networking theory
of innovation organization.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.020
I think it's an
intriguing piece.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.140
They argue that we are now at
a stage in the world economy

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.640
that complex technologies
drive the economy.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.900
So with complex technologies,
the lone inventor

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.432
in the garage working solo--

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:13.015
that's a myth.

00:03:13.015 --> 00:03:16.570
That doesn't work anymore,
because the technologies that

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.930
lead to innovation are just
too complex, they argue.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.230
So that means that
the traditional focus

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.510
of US technology policy on
R&D at particular institutions

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.520
and in open markets, that's not
necessarily right anymore, they

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.810
argue.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.680
So they say that a much
more self-conscious

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.610
networked learning
environment is actually key.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.690
And what does that mean?

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.670
Well, complex technologies, we
know, dominate world exports--

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.650
82% in 1995 compared
to 43% in 1970.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.110
The rise in complex
products means

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.840
a rise in complex organizational
models that goes with it.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.060
The number of
corporate alliances,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.070
corporate interrelationships,
the connectedness

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.980
to the actors, becomes all
that much more critical

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.930
when the dominant products
are complex technology based.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.910
So as product complexity
grows, the need

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.440
for innovative networks grows.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.480
And technological
progress in this phase

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480
really requires that network
learning, integrating,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.370
and applying a
whole wide variety

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.490
of new science and technology
knowledge and know-how.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.690
That now becomes key.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.680
Gee whiz, you know, we're
not organized around that.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.080
If these guys are right,
we've got an innovation system

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.590
that's organized on a
much earlier idea of how

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.240
technologies evolve.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.660
It doesn't necessarily reflect
the reality of the complexity,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.370
and the fact that
the complexity drives

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.870
much more complex organizational
system, which includes

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.190
networking, they argue.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.640
So they cite George Brown,
who is a great former chairman

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.850
of the House Science Committee,
on the point that neglect

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.700
of the processes of
knowledge and their diffusion

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.900
and application needs to be a
core concern of the innovation

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.400
system.

00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:28.620
And Brown is talking
about particularly

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.100
at the governmental level, the
governmental kind of role here.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.090
There's new kinds of
learning that need

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.030
to take place and need
to be organized around.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.360
If you're going
to have this kind

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.400
of learning network system--

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.830
so a shared network
learning, which

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.830
cuts across a series
of institutions,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.040
institutional
engineering that brings

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.620
in other parts of the systems,
like the regulatory side,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.550
into the network--

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.780
there's got to be a
whole evaluation and what

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.230
they call co-evaluation
between complex organizations

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.420
and the technologies
that they're developing.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.360
So learning by doing,
learning by using,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.850
learning from scientific
and technology advances,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.300
learning from spillovers,
learning from interaction.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.120
They argue that these are
whole new features of learning

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.287
that need to occur that
aren't necessarily accounted

00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:24.300
for our current
learning systems.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.690
So they need to be changed
to really accommodate

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.990
the new realities of the
way in which innovation is

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.700
going to have to get organized.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.210
So that's their proposition.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.120
I thought it was just
kind of a fun read.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.622
It tells us a little more
about the determinism piece

00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:43.080
that we were talking
about earlier,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.250
complex technologies demand
new organizational models.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.980
And if Nelson is right,
innovation organization really

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.070
amounts to a core direct
innovation factor,

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.660
then you know stuff like what
Rycroft and Kash are proposing

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.620
becomes significant
in the process.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.140
Lily, it's all yours.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.127
LILY: That was speedy.

00:07:02.127 --> 00:07:03.710
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I'm going

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.150
to go high-speed for
the rest of the class.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.610
LILY: First I'll point
out a couple of things

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.800
that Bill didn't hit the World
Economic Forum 2015-16 report.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.870
They do mention that, after the
global economic crisis of 2008,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.360
economies are experiencing
increased growth again--

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.120
and actually in
the United States,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.820
are experiencing the lowest
unemployment rate since 2008.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.680
However, global
economies are projected

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.490
to have slower rates
of economic growth

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.020
than they did pre-housing or
global economic crisis of 2008.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.865
And so that sort of
brought me to a question--

00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:47.290
it was a question for a couple
of the rest of you as well--

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.700
which is, why is it
not enough, or is

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.670
it enough, for growth
rates to be positive

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.970
and slow and steady?

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.100
So what is the magic thing that
happens between a growth rate

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.187
of about, what are we at, 1.8%?

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:03.770
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, around 2.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.750
LILY: And about 3%,
which seems to be more

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.620
of an optimistic atmosphere.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.900
So what's going on
in that 1%, and do we

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.990
need to maybe, for the next
few years, post 2008 prices?

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.070
With the global
economy struggling,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.780
do we need to readjust
ourselves to adapt to a lower

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780
rate of economic growth?

00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:33.110
MAX: So in the
report, I remember

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.530
that they had mentioned
that we should

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.010
be trying to push further
and try to keep our growth,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.200
to try to make it faster.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.270
But when I was reading
I felt like, well,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.060
maybe that extremely
high growth rate

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.300
was emphasized in the first
place, part of it anyway.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.600
So, at least from what I
see, maybe we should just

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.160
try to adapt to
what we have now,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.888
and just keep things
more steady [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:04.152
we do that it'll
be less intense.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:06.610
AUDIENCE: So, like kind of stay
on that more gradual slope,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.350
rather than the steep one that
bubbles out and then hits that?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.625
Is that what you're saying?

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:12.412
MAX: Yeah.

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:14.870
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: So let
me take that on for a minute.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.840
Because if technological
and related innovation is

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.390
the dominant causative
factor of growth,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.950
and your societal well-being
depends upon your ability

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.860
to have that growth and to
spread that well-being across

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.290
this society, then if we're
stuck at a one at a 1.8-2%

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.490
growth rate, isn't that going
to be an enduring disruptive

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.787
problem in this society?

00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:43.370
Aren't we going to
be a lot better off

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.065
if we could push that up to 3%?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.417
LILY: Is it emotional?

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:52.550
Is it like the stock market,
that's emotionally driven?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.758
Is that what's going on here?

00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:55.300
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Well, if we've

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.460
got a deep problem of
economic income inequality

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.770
at this point, an economic
growth rate helps a lot

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.080
in dealing with that.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.780
It's much more problematic
to deal with that

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.490
with a low growth rate.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.580
For example, this kind of
barbell effect that we've

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.740
got in this society of a growing
upper-middle class, and then

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.020
a thinning middle, and a
growing lower-end services,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.870
lower-paid services sector
which the middle is being pushed

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.330
into, it gets a
lot harder to fix

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.820
that unless you've got
a stronger growth rate,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.320
I'd argue.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.340
I understand your point.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.310
How much stuff do we
really need, right?

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.280
How many things we
actually have to have?

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.270
Is there a whole new way
of organizing this society?

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.646
So you're making an interesting
underlying point, I think, Max.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.520
AUDIENCE: Then there's also
the competitive [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:56.190
competitive piece we're supposed
to be beating other countries.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.016
We need those innovation
waves if we're

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:03.000
going to keep ownership
of technologies.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.880
MAX: Although, in this
more globalized world,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.420
we're all very
connected, which is

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.420
why the housing crisis
that really was local

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.970
here affected everyone.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.600
AUDIENCE: Yes, on
the other hand,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.730
we definitely see
ourselves as leaders

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:19.940
compared to other countries.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.357
I mean, there's
no doubt about it,

00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:23.470
and I think that
there's a real argument

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.350
to be made that if
we're not the ones

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.720
to do the discovery around
energy, or whatever,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.840
others will.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.290
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: And
the gains are substantial.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.315
A first mover advantage
is substantial.

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:37.690
AUDIENCE: But I
guess I would say

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.520
that it's a good
question of how much do

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.632
we really need to consume?

00:11:42.632 --> 00:11:44.500
LILY: Or perhaps
it's not necessarily

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.990
the 1.8% that's
the problem, it's

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.700
the one-two punch
of the dot-com,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.440
our technological wave,
or bubble, bursting,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.070
and then immediately
after that having

00:11:54.070 --> 00:12:01.670
also a global economic crisis
that compounded each other.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.330
But one of your points
brought up another question

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.850
that someone made, and
that is have we identified,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.520
either within the United
States or internationally,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.480
what could be our
next innovative wave?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.280
And is it the same
for the United States

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.500
as it is for the
rest of the world,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.083
or have we even
identified it or do we

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:23.478
think we know what it is yet?

00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:27.243
MARTIN: The next
wave is probably

00:12:27.243 --> 00:12:30.770
going to be biotech as well.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.480
Because what's
happening with biotech

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.080
is that there's this thing
called Moore's law, which

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.970
is a [INAUDIBLE] every year,
I think, every 18 months

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.400
you double your capabilities.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.730
For a lot of bioengineering the
ability to sequence and also

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.098
write DNA, [INAUDIBLE]
sequencing,

00:12:49.098 --> 00:12:50.640
I forget how fast
the [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.940
You might be able to Google
it, I forget what the name is.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.898
LILY: That's what I do.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:58.070
The Human Genome Project
was over 10 years and cost

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.570
billions of dollars,
and now I can

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.967
sequence a couple hundred
genomes for a few thousand

00:13:02.967 --> 00:13:04.170
dollars.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.105
MARTIN: Those kind of
exponential economics

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:08.820
is what drives the next wave.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.461
But that's a lot like
IT, energy would probably

00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:14.650
be like [SNAPS] somebody
figures some key thing out,

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.780
and it's all ahead.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.290
Due to the nature
of that market,

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.873
because of fusion
and stuff like that,

00:13:20.873 --> 00:13:22.350
you could figure out a way to--

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.633
LILY: True, but then I think--

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:25.800
AUDIENCE: It's not the
history of energy technology.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.715
LILY: Yeah, I was going to say
something like, for example,

00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:29.340
the light bulb.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.615
Yeah, sure, Edison figured
out the light bulb,

00:13:31.615 --> 00:13:33.990
but then on top of that, there
was all the infrastructure

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.180
and moving over
to that technology

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.447
that really spilled over.

00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:41.280
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
So Lily, why don't we

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.002
go to Rycroft and Kash.

00:13:45.002 --> 00:13:49.410
LILY: It was summarized
by Bill, and I just

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.440
wanted to bring attention
to a couple of questions

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.620
about Rycroft and Kash.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.280
So one was a closed question.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.680
How do you strike
a proper balance,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.440
or can you identify a proper
balance between encouraging

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.620
competitive R&D inside a
single industry or field,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.000
and then for encouraging
this collective learning

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.390
that Rycroft and Kash
say is so important?

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.230
And I also have a
similar question

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.840
is, is it possible
to foster networking

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.280
and shared learning while
protecting profits and patents?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.680
Which I think is exactly
what you were saying.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.410
So do we-- yeah.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.000
AUDIENCE: So, while not always
considered the most innovative

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.750
field, the oil and gas
sector has actually

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.910
come up with interesting ways
to do shared learning with,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.440
like, joint industry
projects where

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.990
they have third-party labs
run projects and companies

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.960
or buy into them.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.890
And that they all share the
knowledge of information that

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.073
has collective good to them.

00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.740
And I've always thought
it's interesting

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.020
that you don't see that
in many other industries,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.520
but it seems like it has a
lot of potential to be useful.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.180
Some of you sign these
confidentiality agreements,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.050
and you recognize
that we all benefit

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.790
from understanding this better.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.303
It seems like it could
be widely applicable

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:04.220
AUDIENCE: I think one
thing to note about that

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.690
is that oil and gas is
pretty mature heard industry.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.850
And, say, take biotech.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.610
There's a ton of startups
and new companies,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.990
like for example the new IP
battle over the CRISPR/Cas-9

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.570
technology, that's huge, because
there's so many different

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.490
companies-- like five or six--

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.020
things spawned out of these core
ideas and these IP technologies

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.060
that they're licensing
from essentially

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.490
two different entities.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.580
And whoever gets those rights,
they have to pay money to.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.760
So I think it makes
sense, like to kind

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.280
of share knowledge on
a more mature level,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.100
but for early technologies
and early companies

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.240
it's hard to say,
because you're still

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.560
trying to protect
your market share

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.450
and kind of enter
the market that way.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.450
AUDIENCE: Could I
[INAUDIBLE] you?

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.970
How do you feel
like that will be

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.090
impacted by international
science competitiveness?

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I feel like
international kind of--

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.690
AUDIENCE: Again, so
I probably should've

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.750
framed that a
little bit better, I

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.300
think the context of
CRISPR technologies,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.070
it's primarily domestic right?

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.150
It's really Berkeley
and MIT who are really

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.200
fighting for the patent.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.190
So in that instance,
what do you think,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.370
in terms of this
particular technology,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.350
is the role in
international competition

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.420
or is this a conflict that
can be resolved domestically--

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.530
in another more
innovative way that

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.814
does not involve patenting?

00:16:34.814 --> 00:16:36.189
I don't know if
that's too much--

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:39.660
AUDIENCE: So I think the fight
also kind of extends to Europe,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.780
just because there has been
some patents filed there.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.510
I don't know too much about
the legal stuff necessarily,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.110
but I think especially
since CRISPR

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.170
is kind of like the new
frontier for biotech and medical

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.020
technologies to really get
into the genome editing

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.595
and could be really
applicable to a whole bunch

00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:59.220
of different subfields
and applications

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.630
that actually about lot labs are
working on here and elsewhere.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.349
So I think it's also
kind of international,

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.290
just because companies abroad--

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.960
I'm sure Germany and other
big biotech companies

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.950
there are probably interested
in probably working them,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.887
like right now.

00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:16.470
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Right, and just

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.920
to add a point to this IP point
that you all have been raising.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.660
So in our panoply of direct and
indirect innovation factors,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.470
this whole world of intellectual
property rights is indirect,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.600
but we can all see how
potentially significant

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.240
it could be.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.530
In other words, it's not
going to fundamentally affect

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.032
your ability to undertake
the innovation itself,

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:38.490
but it sure may
affect your ability

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.996
to realize gains off of it.

00:17:45.708 --> 00:17:48.800
MATT: Can I ask a quick
question about the--

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.110
you mentioned the
advantage of a first mover,

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.457
and so Nelson was saying
that the first firm doesn't

00:17:56.457 --> 00:18:00.150
necessarily get most
of the economic gains.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.740
To me intuitively,
especially where

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.240
it's something
like energy, where

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.075
you're maybe the first person,
and you're setting up a bunch

00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:08.616
nuclear plant, you get stuck
with outdated infrastructure,

00:18:08.616 --> 00:18:10.926
and you can't change that.

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:13.403
So could you elaborate
a little bit on that?

00:18:13.403 --> 00:18:15.320
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Matt, I agree with you.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.660
I think the distinction
here, and I probably

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.590
should have been more explicit,
but the first-mover advantage

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.290
in launching an innovation
wave, in other words

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.790
a national or regional advantage
for the benefitting economy,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.940
I think is very real.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.920
I think the point you made,
that the first-mover advantage

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.075
for a particular firm may
be much more questionable.

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.450
Others may see
what they're doing

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.460
and be able to make
improvements and bring those out

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.860
more rapidly than the initial
firm that's kind of locked

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.450
into its initial approach.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:50.210
And we see in many cases,
with new inventions that

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.270
bring on innovation
advances, we can certainly

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.220
see firms that have a
first-mover advantage.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.820
We can also see second movers
that are able to capture that.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.420
So I think it's a more complex
question at that company level,

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.420
but I think it's clearer
at the regional economy,

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.690
national economy kind of level.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.510
So I would argue that the US,
by building strong innovation

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.170
capacity and its ability to
lead most of the innovation

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:25.470
waves of the second half
of the 20th century,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.360
that was a huge advantage.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.760
That was a huge gain.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.690
So no sooner did the US miss
the quality manufacturing wave

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.400
to Japan in the '70s and
'80s, but it came right back

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.390
with the IT innovation wave in
the '90s, which Japan missed.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.860
So when you put your economy
at the edge of the frontier,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.130
leadership of the frontier,
capturing those innovation

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.824
waves becomes pretty important.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.400
But I digress, Lily.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.705
LILY: We have 45 minutes
total left, which

00:20:00.705 --> 00:20:02.630
would mean 15 for each of us.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.130
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Why don't you

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.320
give us a closing thought
on Rycroft and Kash.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.280
LILY: OK.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.893
Yeah, I thought they needed to
be more explicit with what they

00:20:12.893 --> 00:20:14.690
were actually saying,
as someone who

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.480
doesn't come from an
economics background,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.483
the terminology was
hard for me to get past.

00:20:21.483 --> 00:20:23.150
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
All this learning

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.940
by doing was a
little too squishy.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.820
LILY: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.320
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Right
you need a more exact portrait.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.570
LILY: I need my terms defined.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.820
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Got it.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.020
OK, well, I think
that's a valid critique.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.520
All right.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.470
So I'm going to race
through the next couple,

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.015
which, Martin, I
think you've got.

00:20:38.015 --> 00:20:38.557
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.100
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
This is Egils Milbergs

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.490
and I'm not going spend
a lot of time on it.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.240
But again, it's one of these
indirect factors that turns out

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.520
to have some significance here.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:59.150
His point is the old economy
was a world of tangible assets.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.440
What counted were your plant,
your equipment, your land,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.040
your physical resources,
your product inventory,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.000
your infrastructure, support
system, physical stuff.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.170
In the 21st century
of a new economy,

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:23.050
intellectual and intangible
assets, those are key.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.030
So we have a wonderful 19th
century accounting system.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.500
It's really wonderful.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.080
Can really value
the old economy.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.858
It really can't value
the new economy.

00:21:36.858 --> 00:21:39.400
And we've been discussing this
whole problem with the ability

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.400
to get capital on the advances.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.850
If you've got an
accounting system that

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:51.193
can't value true value in the
new economy, then of course

00:21:51.193 --> 00:21:53.110
you're going to have a
serious problem getting

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.840
capital funding available.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.210
So here's an indirect
thing, you know,

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.270
the accounting
system, that turns out

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.860
to have a fairly
significant effect.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:09.250
So the inability to
measure intangibles

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.170
undermines the
willingness of firms

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.260
to invest in innovation
because they can't really

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.770
score it and get gains from it,
and it limits the investment

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.880
flow into innovation
as a result.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.290
So, and he argues,
paints a picture,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.910
of how this intangible
process came about,

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:34.090
arguing that by the late 90s,
looking at the US economy

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.520
overall, it was about
$1.1 trillion invest

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.090
in intangible assets in
the manufacturing sector.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.670
In that same sector, there
was a trillion dollars in

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.240
combined in R&D business
processes and software.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.180
Much more intangible.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.740
And intangible
capital, he argues,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.520
became 82% of US
firms' market value,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.700
just an overwhelming portion
of their market value.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.310
So we need new
metrics for how firms

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:09.400
invest in these qualitative
innovation factors,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.220
so that we can drive
investment in an efficient way

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.070
and to the right places and
we just don't have them.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.780
We only measure a
couple of things.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.570
We measure total
company R&D investment--

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.940
that gets reported
on quarterly reports,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.220
and we get company
patent filings--

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.810
that gets revealed as well.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.068
But then all this other
stuff, and maybe these

00:23:28.068 --> 00:23:29.110
aren't the right factors.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.777
Maybe some of them
are completely wrong.

00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:33.350
But there's a whole set of
other potential measures

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.360
we don't even ask for,
or even think about how

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.610
they could be best organized.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:44.280
So that's Egils core idea here.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.780
That's why you need to get some
of these indirect innovation

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.720
factors right, along
with the direct ones.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.330
Another example.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.710
This was Udayan
Gupta's early book

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.990
on venture capital, kind of
an early history of venture

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.490
capital.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.950
It came out in 2000.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:09.580
Venture capital, by 1999,
had grown from $3 billion

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.460
at the beginning of the
decade to $30 billion.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.690
Now venture capital in
2015 was $60 billion.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.540
So venture capital
was built on the idea

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.460
that introducing
new technologies

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.472
delivers much higher
investor returns.

00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:25.930
Remember that chart
that one of you

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.680
cleverly asked me how many
years it covered, was that--

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.270
that was Martin?

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.220
This is, he's saying
the same thing.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.190
In other words,
if you can capture

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.942
the gains of radical investment,
they can be really big.

00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:42.400
And that's what
the venture capital

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.600
sector is organized around.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.030
And he notes this
interesting history.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.420
So we're in one of the
capitals of venture capital,

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.910
we're in the place
that originated it.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.170
The East Coast model originally
was much more focused

00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.260
on what we would call, today,
financial engineering--

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.100
you know, tax benefits,
short term returns,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.860
that conceptual framework kind
of dominated the early Boston

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.290
venture capital model.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.350
The West Coast developed
a very different model

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.220
around science and
technology-driven growth

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.440
in places like Sand Hill
Road and Silicon Valley,

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.790
it's still its capita.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:27.020
So now those distinctions
have pretty much disappeared.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.800
Both sides are in the same game.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.830
And you include within the
term of venture capital,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.900
some people include a
much broader phraseology,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.700
including angel investors,
corporate venture firms,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.560
foundation venture
firms, sometimes

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.180
university endowment
funds, that go

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.520
to a venture kind of purpose.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.110
So it's a bigger landscape than
it was at the early stages.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.510
But the East Coast
model, which did things

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.600
like late-stage buyouts,
turnarounds, roll-UPS,

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.110
consolidations, in addition
to early-stage venture.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.020
That's now prevalent, frankly,
in both the East Coast and West

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.410
Coast models.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.380
So the two sides
have kind of merged.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.830
The originator of the
venture capital idea

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.420
was General Georges Doriot,
who was World War II general,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.990
helped in the
organization of industry

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.500
in Europe during World War
II and following it, so

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.342
a remarkable figure.

00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:24.050
He taught at the
Harvard Business School,

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.930
but he's the one who kind
of saw this potential gain

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.775
from innovation-based growth.

00:26:28.775 --> 00:26:32.390
And the West Coast model really
was kind of a maverick model.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.750
It was very high-risk
investment based

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.530
on quite unproven technologies,
and that turned out

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.495
to be the right model.

00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:43.370
The problem is we're
not frankly doing enough

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.787
of that in enough
areas, and we'll

00:26:44.787 --> 00:26:47.030
get to that at another
point in class.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.970
So that's the venture capital
story, and let me just close,

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.720
and then we'll have some
dialogue that Martin will lead.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.650
This is Charles Schultze, who
was quite a famous economist.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.950
He was budget director
for Lyndon Johnson

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.510
and for Jimmy
Carter, who is head

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.100
of the Council of
Economic advisors.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.060
Very highly thought of
economist from Minnesota.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.080
Deep historical role in
governmental policymaking.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.560
He's taking a look
at the debate--

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.400
which will actually get
into our next class--

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.640
about what's going on with
Japan's economy of the 70s

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.890
and 80s, where they're
bringing on this new innovation

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.880
wave of quality manufacturing
and the US is trying

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.720
to figure out how to respond.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.555
And he's talking about
the political debate,

00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:35.930
much as we were talking about
the political debate that's

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.880
going on now, he
was talking about

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.990
the current political
debate of that time

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.780
when he writes this in 1983.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.690
And there was a big debate
over US competitiveness.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.660
There was a deep concern
that the US was, guess what,

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.070
de-industrializing.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.870
Sound familiar?

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.530
That essential US heavy
industry was in decline.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:04.040
And the 80s concern was that the
US may have been at the cutting

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.650
edge of technology advanced,
but it was not implementing

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.810
those technology advances.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:13.160
Whereas, by comparison, the
US perception of the time

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.940
was that they had a very
activist governmental kind

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.940
of role, an interventionist
governmental kind of role,

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.910
that's identifying
technological winners

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.270
and moving those right
into implementation.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.630
So in a way, Martin,
it's like the point

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.920
you were raising earlier.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.350
Don't just do
sculptures, do buildings.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.120
Japan was deep into
the building phase.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.070
The US was still at
the sculpture phase.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.875
And its principal arm
for doing this was MITI--

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.420
which is now called METI--

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.620
but still very prevalent.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.200
But considerably less
interventionist now

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.100
than it was back
in the 70s and 80s.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.050
What proposals are
the parties coming up

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.590
with on how to deal with this?

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.770
Well, here's what the
Democrats were up to.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.340
They decided there should be
an industrial development bank.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.670
It would, just like
in Japan, pick winners

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.690
and, heaven forbid, it
would protect losers.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.310
So no one would have to lose,
jobs would be protected,

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.660
and so forth.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.980
And yet they would also
select winning new areas

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.110
to get investment.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.950
And it would work to rehab
failing major industries,

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.890
upgrade them, protect
their workforces,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.900
but also attempt on
working on a new labor

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.560
agreement between
management and labor

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.670
to get labor cost
cuts that would

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.300
help fund the restoration
of these sectors.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.140
That was the Democrats idea.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.690
The Republican idea was to--

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.910
you guessed it-- support
reductions in marginal tax

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:54.410
rates.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.855
Schultze is very
concerned about this idea.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.630
His concern is that the
US government is not

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.250
able to select a winning
industrial structure.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.620
This is just not a good job
for government to be doing.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.570
It will not be good at this.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.080
The regional politics,
the state politics,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.630
are just so powerful
that it's going

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.460
to unglue the
government's ability

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.180
to pick a winning technology
sector and ride with it.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.663
It's going to have
to be dispersed,

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.330
everybody's going to
have to have gains,

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.940
jobs are going to have to be
located all over the place.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.520
Just not something that's
going to be supported well,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.490
that the political system
really cannot efficiently choose

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:46.490
between individual firms,
and particularly regions,

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.530
for getting support at this
stage of the industrial

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.640
process.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.250
So find and support
R&D, but when

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.070
it comes closer much
further down the pipeline

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.460
and you're actually picking
industrial winners, that's

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.160
a really tricky political
process he warns us about.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.770
So a lot of this
class, as you all

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.630
were driving us
towards today, is

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.050
going to be what is
the governmental role.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.510
So Schultze stands
as a warning about

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.150
the political imperfections
of government,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.580
the political
difficulties of government

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.520
in undertaking an
interventionist role.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.690
So I think that's probably
a pretty good since we all

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.730
skipped the rest of
Schultze, but that's

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.520
really his core
idea, is to tell us

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.300
a cautionary tale about what
the governmental role is going

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:40.960
to be.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.510
That the sheer massive
weight of politics

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.460
is not going to necessarily
drive optimal technology

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.490
decision-making.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:50.990
Now.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.230
Martin, let me turn
it over to you,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.490
and let's go
through these three.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:00.170
So first Egils,
and then maybe do

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.420
a couple of questions on
that and say some points,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:10.143
and then let's do Gupta on
the venture capital structure.

00:32:10.143 --> 00:32:11.810
MARTIN: Just do like
a general overview?

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.185
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
let's just have an overview,

00:32:14.185 --> 00:32:17.400
and we'll start with
Milbergs, and then

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.083
go into a couple of questions.

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.000
MARTIN: The objective
is to increase incentive

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.490
for private sector, especially
long-term, innovation

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.650
strategies and
investments, but that

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.370
can be pretty difficult to do.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:32.490
Market values are driven by
economic conditions, demand,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.553
potential market
size, and profits.

00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:36.636
Various [INAUDIBLE]
competitors reason [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:39.510
alternative substitutes.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.610
But intangible
assets most likely

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.310
will determine the long-term
success of a company.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.880
It has to do a lot with
their corporate strategy.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.980
Most likely, the
company that we see

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.902
that are successful
today that are going

00:32:52.902 --> 00:32:54.360
to be successful
100 years from now

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.680
won't be doing the same thing.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.590
An easy example
would be if you look

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.020
at what Monsanto, originally
they were a chemical company,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.030
and now they're
focusing on agriculture.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.420
So I know a few of these
long-term innovation

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.120
strategies, on these things
that are hard to measure.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.230
And so a couple of
questions that were left up

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.110
were, what innovation trends
and sectors represent the most

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.717
promising growth areas
for VCs in the few years?

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.050
What can incentivize the shift
to long-term intrinsic value

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.485
creation compared to
short-term objectives?

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.440
If anybody has any interesting
insights or experiences

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.050
that just kind of [INAUDIBLE]
Feel free to share them.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.450
Rasheed: I think
about, particularly

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.592
the old accounting
system, which is

00:33:47.592 --> 00:33:50.985
kind of measuring money flows,
financial engineering which

00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:54.730
is kind of important, I think
that might have been easy--

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.010
I guess it was easy and so
it's easy to probably think

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.130
of it as easy because you
were doing it for so long.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.460
But I think particularly
in valuing its intangibles

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.310
as something that
we see is going

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.330
to be create all this growth.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:11.530
And then, I don't know if
there's any management studies

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.370
or kind of behavioral things
that we can take a look at how

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.790
are we doing at
these intangibles,

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.282
because these intangibles
seem like something like,

00:34:21.282 --> 00:34:22.449
you know it when you see it.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.130
You might not be able
to put bounds on it,

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.429
or put a number on it.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.034
I feel like it's because
we haven't tried.

00:34:29.034 --> 00:34:30.409
And so I don't
know if there have

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:34.440
been any efforts sustained,
or even accepted,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.929
or even argued over, to start
valuing these intangible things

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.690
as we can complain all we want
about how we can't measure

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.580
the intangibles [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.830
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: So,
Rasheed, a very interesting

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:46.330
point.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.000
And there's been a significant
amount of work in Britain,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.139
actually, to try and figure
out measurement systems

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:59.420
for these intangibles, these
kind of know-how based assets.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.430
And then following
from that work

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.000
in the EU on trying
to measure these.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.440
Interestingly, we really
haven't done much in the US

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.562
on this, as crucial as it is.

00:35:08.562 --> 00:35:10.520
AUDIENCE: Because I think
it's really important

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.710
to have some sort
of standardized way

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.990
to measure this, because
otherwise it all comes down

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.190
to trust between
companies and investors,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.850
and companies will always have
an incentive to overstate what

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.320
their intangible assets are.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.070
And because they're
intangible it's harder

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.730
to prove whether they're
being honest or not,

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:33.360
so there needs some sort
of standardization process.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.350
AUDIENCE: On the other end, like
from an investing standpoint,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.880
isn't the fact that valuing
intangibles and things

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.460
like IP, the main
reason why there could

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.510
be like hidden value or
of mispricing based on,

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.660
because not everyone
has a good idea of how

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.810
to price these things,
that's how they can find sort

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:58.370
of an edge based off other
companies that might not

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.510
have the same insight.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.000
I feel like that might
be one of the reasons

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.900
why there hasn't been
a push to kind of,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.900
I don't know, standardize,
how to quantify those-- not

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.370
only because it's difficult to.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.200
Especially, like, I
think he brought up

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.790
like customer satisfaction.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.060
I feel like that's really
hard to figure out a way

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.420
to come up with a
metric to say, oh,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.002
this customer satisfaction
is higher than this one.

00:36:24.002 --> 00:36:26.918
I feel like it'd be
difficult but interesting

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:28.376
to come up with a system.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.800
AUDIENCE: I was also
curious whether he's

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.590
talking about a system that's
applicable to companies

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.340
in different industries,
or just companies

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.900
within the same industry.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.150
Are you looking at
Dropbox and Box,

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.540
or are you looking at
like Dropbox and Facebook?

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.850
Can you actually
compare across--

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:56.220
not even the same industry, but
across like applications, even.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.720
MARTIN: Another
interesting question

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.660
to add onto that is,
why are we treating

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.630
intellectual property for
different industries the same?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.480
I think the lifetime of a
pattern is around 20 years,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.130
and so why is it
that something that

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.370
is really easy or relatively
easy to do that [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.530
as a patent for IT, like for
Facebook, where it's very

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.610
quick to capture value
relatively to other industries

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.980
versus like energy, where
they might take you years

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.740
and years of research to do it.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.460
And then even to
execute, 20 years

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.900
is a short time frame because
it might take you 10 years

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.650
to negotiate where
you're going to put it,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.610
right, if you're doing
a reactor system.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.083
So by the time you
kind of get started,

00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:39.000
there's incentives there
to now really focused

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.833
on those industries.

00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:43.110
So even biotech, where I
think it's around a billion

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.900
to $2 billion to create a drug.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.660
Why aren't there longer
intellectual property cycles

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.670
for those industries,
in order to incentivize

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.200
more growth in those areas?

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.910
MATT: So I mean, the 20 year
thing is a general framework,

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.020
but there is for
pharmaceuticals,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.920
there are patent
laws that will extend

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.560
the lifetime of your patent to
compensate for some of the R&D.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.472
But they do exist.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.760
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: When
we do a class on the life

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.740
science, health science
kind of case study,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.430
we'll get deeply into this whole
question about patent term,

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.490
and could you start
to vary patent term,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:32.330
to encourage small-market drugs,
third-world disease drugs which

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.390
wouldn't ordinarily come
about to the system.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.090
Where you're right, our
team, we've got to capture

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.352
a [? billion-eight ?] just
upfront in order to bring

00:38:42.352 --> 00:38:43.060
a drug to market.

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:48.351
MARTIN: Did anybody have
any interesting thoughts

00:38:48.351 --> 00:38:50.351
or disputes or any ideas
they wanted to express?

00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:56.960
[INAUDIBLE] Can you put
on the Doriot slide?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.730
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Sure.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.700
MARTIN: So originally, venture
capital started, the story

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.330
is that William Shockley
came up with the transistor.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:10.050
He won a Nobel Prize for it,
but then he got really cocky.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.670
And he had all these
brilliant people,

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.440
he acquired the best
talent in the nation, PhDs

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.510
from MIT, Stanford at
the time, and they all

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.950
came to work for him.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.800
But he was such a bad boss
that all these great minds felt

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.330
under stress working for him.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.980
They were called the
Traitorous Eight,

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.648
and they chose to leave him
and start their own company.

00:39:29.648 --> 00:39:31.940
What they did is they wrote
a letter to this guy called

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.610
Arthur Rock, who was a
Wall Street financier,

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.100
and they asked him if they
could get some funding

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.525
to create their own company.

00:39:39.525 --> 00:39:41.400
And they had a strong
IP and strong knowledge

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.642
of the industry.

00:39:43.642 --> 00:39:44.600
And he got the funding.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.120
So that was the beginnings
of venture capital.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.210
It really didn't speed up until
the 90s and the IT revolution,

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.180
because originally venture
capital was very much

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.860
a long-form capital.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.860
What happened is that
you would invest money,

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:03.180
and you expected it-- they were
going to get a core capability,

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.050
they were able to reap profits
for long periods of time.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.430
But that changed when
the IT religion hit,

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.520
in that it could be a fast
way of making a return.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.910
And so a venture capital fund
became a lot like hedge fund,

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.260
and it took a lot more risk.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.050
So pretty much the
way a VC firm runs

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.780
is they'll last round 10 years.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.180
The way they work is that
they focus on outliers,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.860
and winning with outliers, so
pretty much what they'll do

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.380
is, they'd give
each of us about--

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.780
well, I'll just keep
the same figures--

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.238
so they'll give us each like
a seed round of about $100,000

00:40:39.238 --> 00:40:41.700
to a million, but they
only expect one of us

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.287
to really become
like a Facebook.

00:40:43.287 --> 00:40:45.120
And they know that every
single year there's

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.010
probably only like
10 companies that you

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.260
should invest in that are
going to be the big winners.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:55.230
And they focus on these
multiple high-factor returns.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.600
If you make less than 15x
to your original investment

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.420
as a VC, you're
considered a bad VC.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.380
And there's still only
like a couple of VCs

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.830
that are known as the
really, really good ones,

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.190
and what they focus
doing nowadays

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.460
is not just getting you money.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.627
They actually focus on
helping you build out a team.

00:41:11.627 --> 00:41:13.620
And in that paper they
actually talked about,

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.900
we look a lot at the
technology but also the person,

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.360
because pretty much we're
going to help you grow

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.430
this company like it's a jet.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.568
It's going to be
changing rapidly.

00:41:22.568 --> 00:41:24.360
You're going to have
[INAUDIBLE] the person

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.910
during each phase of it.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:31.350
And so this is a form of capital
that has become very popular.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.080
If you look into the, I think
we have some of the numbers

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.517
there for how much was raised
every year in terms of funds.

00:41:38.517 --> 00:41:39.850
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: I got it.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:45.360
MARTIN: A billion in
1990, $30 billion in 1999,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.740
and 2015, $60 billion.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.410
So there is kind of
a VC capital bubble,

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.810
and it's really
illogical because there's

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.935
only ten companies you
should really invest in that

00:41:53.935 --> 00:41:55.320
are going to make huge returns.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.087
At the same time,
though, because it's

00:41:57.087 --> 00:41:59.670
a really great business, or it
seems that way, a lot of people

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.140
are putting in money.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.410
So there's bubble-ish behavior.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.133
And so, couple
questions from that era.

00:42:07.133 --> 00:42:08.550
What innovation
trends and sectors

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.258
represent the most
promising growth areas

00:42:10.258 --> 00:42:12.268
for VCs in the next few years?

00:42:17.138 --> 00:42:19.086
Any questions about VC capital?

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.790
LILY: Yeah I do, actually.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:24.380
It's Lily.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.720
So you said that
in the first round,

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:36.160
or like the younger VC
capital, a few years ago,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.400
the expectation was
for longer return.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.110
Now we've been spoiled
with the tech revolution

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.000
and people want returns on a
two-year, two- to five-year?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.465
Is that reasonable?

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:48.340
MARTIN: More or less.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.930
Like, if you're a
really great company

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:53.580
you're going to exit to an
IPO in about seven years, ten

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.080
years.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.455
So that's what
we're looking for.

00:42:58.831 --> 00:43:08.032
LILY: Can VC have funds that
mix, long-term and short-term?

00:43:08.032 --> 00:43:09.740
Is that what they're
going to have to do,

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.990
because I see short term
and this huge influx.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.200
Look, we have
excess capital now.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.140
If you say that there are only x
number of companies that really

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.620
hit it big in the short-term,
we have excess capital as

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.550
compared to previous years.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.740
So do you think
that VCs are going

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.400
to have to start paying more
attention to long-term returns,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.000
and is that a more sustainable
business model for them?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.642
MARTIN: So what's
happened is, it's

00:43:33.642 --> 00:43:35.600
not so much like VCs in
terms of making return,

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.840
because the way a VC fund works
is that they'll acquire money

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.530
from, say, MIT's funds.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.170
And then you increase
that capital.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.570
So a lot of times
they can't say,

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.070
oh, well, we're going to focus
on this and it's much better,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:49.640
it's going to be net profitable,
but not in terms of money.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.125
It'll be good for society.

00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:53.250
That doesn't really happen.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.520
What ends up happening,
recently there's

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.150
been a fund that's like
that, that was invested where

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.910
the investors are Jack Ma
from Alibaba, Bill Gates,

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.740
I forget the name of it--

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.200
Breakthrough Energy-- and they
focus on longer time cycles

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.510
of around 20 years.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.660
And also they focus on having,
it's pretty much like the dream

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.000
team of billionaires on it.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.750
AUDIENCE: And they
announced it a year ago

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.070
and they've now formed
the pool of money,

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.637
but I have yet to hear about
any actual investments.

00:44:20.637 --> 00:44:22.220
MARTIN: The reason
I bring that one up

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.512
is because it's not so much
that they're trying to make

00:44:24.512 --> 00:44:26.150
huge returns on capital.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.970
What they're doing is a mix
of philanthropy and venture

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:30.470
capital.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
patient capital.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.222
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.252
MATT: So, related to
that, I'm sure you

00:44:38.252 --> 00:44:40.550
know that there are VC
firms that will only

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:45.450
do a Series A financing,
Series B financing,

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.430
or Mezzanine financing.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.670
And there are firms that
would do a mix of that,

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.160
at different stages
in companies.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.500
But then you run
into the upper limit,

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.365
where you have groups
like the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:56.365 --> 00:44:59.380
I'm working on where
venture capitalists don't

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:05.620
want to wait more than 15 years
or so to [INAUDIBLE] a return.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.993
AUDIENCE: So I've heard
of the number of funds,

00:45:07.993 --> 00:45:10.410
especially in Silicon Valley,
that aren't just like solely

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.200
VC now, but are also like
long/short equity funds,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.660
like more of a hedge fund
style combined with VC,

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.590
so it's sort of like--

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:19.745
VCs more longer-term
horizon like two

00:45:19.745 --> 00:45:21.760
to five years or whatever.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.870
They're willing to wait out
for but also in the short term,

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.310
playing around with getting
some returns that way.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:31.480
So I think that might
be a response to how

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.960
to address that
problem with what to do

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.680
with a longer-term horizon.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.470
Rasheed: Is it also just
really early to tell?

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.450
Because I guess the
idea is you see firms

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.890
and [INAUDIBLE] So I guess
we're probably not slowing down

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.420
according to this one
venture capital group

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.567
but like, is it kind
of hard to see out,

00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:53.150
you know, these firms
are now starting

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:57.890
to pop up who are willing to
invest out past 15 towards 20

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:03.835
years, and is it a little
bit early for us to say maybe

00:46:03.835 --> 00:46:05.960
these firms might have more
success or less success

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.160
than the traditional model?

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.920
Because it really
is just really new

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.830
and they haven't made
a single investment.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.240
AUDIENCE: Well, and
the percent of VC money

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.732
that this represents is small.

00:46:17.732 --> 00:46:19.940
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Yeah
just to put a few numbers

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.600
on the table.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:26.030
So, venture capital funding
in 2015 was $60 billion.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:29.270
Venture capital funding
before the great recession

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.770
was about $60 billion as well.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.030
So we're sort of
back to that number.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.240
But when you,
think about, I mean

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.810
after all, if growth is driven
by technological and related

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:44.240
innovation, and you've get
$19 trillion economy, say,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.400
nationwide.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.250
$60 billion in nothing.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.290
That's not a lot of
money to be banking

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.870
on what our future
growth is going to be.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:47:00.620
So the issue I think
Martin shrewdly raised,

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.670
was we're not on an
innovation wave at the moment.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:08.030
We're on the kind of
scale-up part of the IT wave.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.610
It's not the 1990s anymore.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.880
VCs really work
amazingly when they're

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.820
right on the cusp of
an innovation wave.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.210
And playing for that very
rapid scale-up in growth so Art

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.700
Rocks' investments
in intel-- which,

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.180
you're absolutely right
Martin, did drive the creation

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.050
of the West Coast model--

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:34.310
that was just at the
cusp of the IT wave.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.720
And the VC firms really
rode it, and we're not

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.470
on one of those
ways at the moment.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.790
So the VC model has gotten
much more complicated,

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.910
because the number of
firms that are actually

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:50.160
going to carry the kind of
rewards that occur typically

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.100
in the fast scale-up part of the
innovation wave is just slower.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.330
Things are slower.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:48:00.980
We're waiting for the
waves, right, like surfers.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:05.420
And I think the old
model, the maverick model,

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.360
will come right back if we
get onto one of these waves,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.790
but as we've discussed
these are typically

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.070
40-year-long propositions.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:16.370
And you can be in a long
trough before a wave takes off,

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:21.210
so that's the fundamental
question for this industry.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.840
On the other hand, maybe there's
another way of looking at it.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.170
Maybe the other way of looking
at it is, could you spur waves

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:31.940
more rapidly, and is
the short-term return

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:38.270
model of venture capital a
real barrier in our ability

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:42.920
to stand up longer, stronger,
more enduring innovation

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.470
waves sooner?

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:50.720
So there's a couple of ways
of looking at this that I

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.620
think are intriguing.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:55.430
And we're going to we're going
to take a dive into venture

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.130
capital later in the
class, kind of looking

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.650
in little more detail, too,
as you suggested, Matt,

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.950
about the engine.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.670
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.030
I was going to bring up, there
is one venture capitalist

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:10.260
that focuses on the longer
time horizons, about 40 years.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.500
His name is Peter Thiel.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.400
Actually the whole idea
that we are kind of

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.402
like a technological
recession is from him.

00:49:16.402 --> 00:49:18.110
He talks a lot about
how we're not really

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.055
increasing our
capabilities, and he's

00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:21.597
famous for having
this one quote that

00:49:21.597 --> 00:49:24.070
goes something
along the lines of,

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.210
we were promised flying cars,
but we got 144 characters.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.940
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: It's one
of my favorite quotes, Martin.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.023
I was going to use it too.

00:49:30.023 --> 00:49:32.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:32.542 --> 00:49:35.000
MARTIN: The thing is, if you
looked into the '50s and '70s,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.647
or if you look at
the comic books,

00:49:37.647 --> 00:49:39.855
if you look at Iron Man and
all different characters,

00:49:39.855 --> 00:49:43.040
they show this
feature where energy,

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.810
flying into the
air, enough water,

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:52.310
we're not focusing on resources
and resource wars anymore.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.810
And what kind of
ended up happening

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:57.170
is we have the IT wave
but now we are even more

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.390
pessimistic, right?

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:03.980
And so his point of view is
more that we have better things,

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.270
in some sense.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.730
But in terms of having these
long-form kind of technologies

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.750
that have a huge impact on our
society, we haven't had that.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:15.420
It's just really good times
for this one technology.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.785
And that's his main proposition.

00:50:16.785 --> 00:50:18.410
But he does focus on
these technologies

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.823
that are a longer timeframe.

00:50:19.823 --> 00:50:21.740
And that might actually
be a huge opportunity,

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.560
because if, you know, $59
billion of the capital

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.730
are focusing on these ten
year sexy chat companies,

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:35.216
like Snapchat, Facebook,
Pinterest, that really won't

00:50:35.216 --> 00:50:37.716
have a big impact, and you're
one of the investors who goes,

00:50:37.716 --> 00:50:39.245
OK, I'll wait 10
more years, but I

00:50:39.245 --> 00:50:41.703
have kind of trillion-dollar
companies, that are coming off

00:50:41.703 --> 00:50:43.900
[INAUDIBLE] That's
a huge opportunity.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.317
The big thing, too, is we were
talking about entrepreneurs

00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:49.440
and how the first
inventor usually

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.870
doesn't capture that value.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.410
This is actually an opportunity
for maybe the first inventor

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.220
to capture a lot of
value, and then people

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.760
focus on that becoming the
first wave of venture again.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.250
But the drawback of
that, too, is that, say,

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.718
somebody in this room discovered
some great technology,

00:51:04.718 --> 00:51:06.843
but you still have like a
semester worth of school,

00:51:06.843 --> 00:51:08.060
or something like that.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.040
You want to stay at
MIT for an extra year.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.960
Somebody could
see the technology

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.140
and go to Silicon Valley,
raise $1 million, $3 million,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.570
and they get the scale.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.770
The Silicon Valley model
isn't first to invent,

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.600
it's first to scale.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.380
Facebook was the 15th social
network invented, pretty much.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:29.210
You've got some notoriety.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.850
So that's another big thing
is that maybe that divide

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.760
between the first wave and
the second wave of invention

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.856
is going to get either
smaller or bigger.

00:51:38.856 --> 00:51:41.830
Just because you have
these kind of Wall Street

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:42.800
hyper-rapid effects.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.690
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.232
So you're driving us, I think,
to an important point, Martin,

00:51:46.232 --> 00:51:50.530
about the venture capital
sector as it's organized now.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.600
It's really organized for
this, that's what it wants.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.780
It doesn't know what
to do with this,

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.920
and it's desperately trying
to make this look like this.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.000
That's kind of where we are.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.630
There's a problem
with his model.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.810
It's not there.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:18.100
And so just as we critique the
Merrill Lynch piece for the gap

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.770
here, and longer-term
patient capital,

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.910
it turns out that the
VC model isn't really

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.370
helping us where we really
need a lot of help, which is

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.020
more in this kind of territory.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.885
Chloe?

00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:32.585
CHLOE: I wonder if some of
that comes from, in this piece

00:52:32.585 --> 00:52:34.100
especially, there seemed to
be a lot of obsession of,

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.350
like, building the right
team, and all the right stuff

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.360
will come if you have the
right billionaires all

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.930
in the room together, just
a small number of people.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:44.170
And it's probably easier to
ask for a lot in a short period

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:48.160
of time from people, because
their career lifespan

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.180
is much shorter than the
lifespan of a technology.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.330
It would be easier to
look a person in the face

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.380
and be like, develop this for
me right now, because, you know,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.440
your career is 20 years long.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.510
Not your career, but that
billionaire [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:05.350
so maybe that's why their
current model is more

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.717
suited for the fast growth,
when actually they're

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.550
in slow growth mode.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.390
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Yeah, so
I mean, Martha was pushing us

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.890
and Martin you
mentioned it as well,

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:16.030
this whole Gates has
organized this new group

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.460
that wants to deal with
exactly this problem.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.590
They want to start dealing
with some of this stuff,

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:25.120
not just trying to focus on
this in order to get an energy

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.890
innovation wave going.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.830
So that may be big enough
to be a different model.

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:31.720
I don't know.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.090
It's not $60 billion and
it's a long way away from it,

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.640
but he is shaking down
people with a lot of money.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.240
AUDIENCE: So, Bill and Martin,
isn't the VC model working

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.760
just fine for the VC firms?

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.260
I mean, Lily mentioned, hey,
there's more capital out there.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.380
I'm not sure that's true.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.313
I think it's-- aren't
they doing just fine?

00:53:48.313 --> 00:53:49.480
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.350
It's fine.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.770
As long as all we want
is software and biotech,

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:54.460
it's great.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.660
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to check on that.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.170
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:56.800
It's great!

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.490
It's fabulous!

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.230
And some services sectors.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.530
Media and entertainment
are good too.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.822
But if the society
wants some other stuff,

00:54:04.822 --> 00:54:07.030
right, then we've got a
serious problem on our hands.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.670
AUDIENCE: And Bill Gates has
taken it upon himself to find--

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:12.045
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: The
energy solution for the world.

00:54:12.045 --> 00:54:12.910
Right.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:17.200
Because energy is a huge loser
in the current venture capital

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:17.770
market.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:20.015
MARTIN: I mean another
thing to consider too,

00:54:20.015 --> 00:54:22.390
is that these institutes--
they're more like institutions

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.940
now.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.980
Like, there's only
really five that matter,

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:28.980
like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen
Horowitz is one of the top

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.400
ones, what's it
called, there's--

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.200
AUDIENCE: John Doerr's group.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.590
MARTIN: John Doerr's
[INAUDIBLE] something like that?

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:39.853
So yeah they're kind of
like the MITs and Harvards.

00:54:39.853 --> 00:54:41.270
Also if you're
getting investment,

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:42.812
you want it from
one of the top ones,

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.950
because you have to get
multiple rounds of funding.

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.500
So if you get your first
round and and investor

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.450
doesn't matter, isn't
that important, it's

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:51.575
going to make it so much
more difficult [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:51.575 --> 00:54:54.000
that will matter in the future.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.233
But another thing too is
that Silicon Valley, which

00:54:56.233 --> 00:54:57.816
is the cool thing
is like they come up

00:54:57.816 --> 00:55:01.050
with all these ideas on how
to structure teams and make

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:02.940
innovation.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.340
They focus a lot on
disruptive business models,

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.170
so what might be interesting
is if somebody who focuses on

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.802
like a harder industry
and the energy sector,

00:55:11.802 --> 00:55:13.260
right now we could
say that they're

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.970
a lot like the early
telegraph lines,

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.930
that they're everywhere, right?

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:18.263
But it's only focused still
on building the mobile phone

00:55:18.263 --> 00:55:18.970
for energy.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:20.553
Or it's something
that's very modular.

00:55:20.553 --> 00:55:23.170
You have these disruptive
angles with technology.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.430
And so the top like
fusion startups right now

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.930
they're focusing
on something that's

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.150
the size of a truck or
a reactor that's mobile

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:31.260
and stuff like that.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.177
But you probably know a
lot better than I did.

00:55:33.177 --> 00:55:34.890
MAX: Yeah, that's
Lockheed Martin.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.510
MARTIN: Lockheed
Martin's is indoor.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.610
I'm talking about Helion.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:42.255
That's the one that YCombinator
or someone invested in.

00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:43.880
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Even YCombinator

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.570
is only two years down.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.393
All right, so I'm
going to push us to--

00:55:48.393 --> 00:55:50.810
why don't you give us a few
comments on Schultze and we'll

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.160
close out the session.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.040
MARTIN: OK I wanted to
link Schultze to this idea,

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.220
too, because should the
government be a VC bunch, maybe

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.280
focusing on let's pick
the winners and the losers

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.410
when inherently, that's
not their nature.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.660
In general you're looking
for the wellfare of society,

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:13.700
and there is a market failure.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.400
Another big aspect, too,
is they've done better--

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.868
well, Schultze's main
point is that economies

00:56:20.868 --> 00:56:23.160
have done better when the
government gives a supportive

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.920
role, and he does talk
a lot about Japan.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.440
I think another factor
to consider for Japan

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.863
and also South Korea, because
I don't think he brought up

00:56:30.863 --> 00:56:33.030
in his paper, but his ideas
kind of align with that,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.270
is that their population
periods were in a certain way.

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:39.858
Usually you hit into these
industrial high-growth areas

00:56:39.858 --> 00:56:42.150
where you have a lot of young
people and very few older

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:43.170
people.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.540
And that's why they kind
of die off very quickly.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.490
So that might be a
hidden factor that he

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:50.540
didn't consider at this point.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.180
But so, yeah.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.597
Is it this idea of, do we
create this for the environment,

00:56:53.597 --> 00:56:55.440
or do we focus on industries?

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.590
I think it also might have been
Jorgenson in the last week's

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.530
class, where he talked about
this idea of specific cities

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.330
that focus on
certain industries.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.990
That was very interesting,
especially contrasting

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.022
with this point of view,
where we make it easier

00:57:09.022 --> 00:57:10.980
to innovate on certain
areas and certain cities

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.350
and you develop the
capability for the city

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:15.780
because cities tend
to last longer.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.260
Well, cities tend to have
longer-lasting effects

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:22.242
where people stay there.

00:57:22.242 --> 00:57:22.950
LILY: It's funny.

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.210
I kept thinking completely
different things while I

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:26.750
was reading the Schultze piece.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:30.270
I kept thinking, or wondering,
would he be writing--

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:34.410
I didn't look up any of his
later papers or pieces--

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.180
but I kept thinking
would he be writing

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.650
the same thing if he wrote
it today or five years ago?

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.507
Because he keeps-- and I
kept thinking, oh my gosh.

00:57:43.507 --> 00:57:45.965
Schultze is the reason we have
the president we have today.

00:57:45.965 --> 00:57:47.520
He keeps on telling
everyone we're

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.590
not de-industrializing,
don't worry,

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:50.910
we're not de-industrializing.

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:53.370
But we really were, weren't we?

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.510
And so, granted, all of
my economic knowledge

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:01.320
comes from Freakonomics,
but I would

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.350
say that wasn't this
a pretty popular view?

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.307
We're not
de-industrializing, or even

00:58:07.307 --> 00:58:09.390
if we are, don't worry,
because the jobs are going

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.210
to be replaced by the technology
that we're developing,

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.470
and so don't worry, don't worry.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.910
And we really let a
lot of the industry

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.347
here get away from us
and to other countries.

00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:21.180
And so I just think he
would change his tune

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.000
if he were writing it today.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.750
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
You know, you raise

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:26.590
a very interesting point, Lily.

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.890
Schultze's writing in 1983.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:32.130
Solow doesn't get the
Nobel Prize until 1987,

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:34.887
so growth economics doesn't--

00:58:34.887 --> 00:58:37.470
Beth and I were talking a little
bit about this before class--

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.080
but growth economics
doesn't really

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.490
lock in until really
we start to see

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.050
what's happening in the 1990s.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:49.170
That's when you can't
ignore growth theory,

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.660
you see it right
in front of you.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:57.370
So Schultze is out of
classical economics.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.650
He keeps pointing us to
Japan's success story

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:04.280
being the national savings rate.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.390
Solow says it's useful,
but that's not the driver,

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:11.000
it's this technological
related innovation.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.960
So in a way you can see
Schultze, just as you suggest,

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.100
as a dialogue within
different stages of economics

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:19.940
thinking right.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.600
And Schultze, in many ways, is
certainly in the neoclassical

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.750
and in a way earlier
classical economics

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:29.840
thinking about growth,
before new growth theory

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.890
develops from people
like Solow and Romer.

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.610
So that's part of
what he's saying here.

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:41.420
But I do think that his
point about the difficulty

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.390
of the political
system to operate

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.820
in a sophisticated
technology realm,

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:49.730
I think that's very real.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:51.825
So every time we--

00:59:51.825 --> 00:59:54.200
you know, I'm guilty of this
periodically-- every time we

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.450
want to expand the
governmental role

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:58.880
and push it further
down the pipeline,

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.730
Schultze always stands
as a warning for me

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.310
about the complexity of how
the political process is

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.090
going to wrestle with this.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.130
And the reward system
in the political system

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:14.840
is not the same reward system
that technology standup

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.585
necessarily needs.

01:00:16.585 --> 01:00:17.960
AUDIENCE: Going
off your point, I

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.120
think it is interesting
that he mentions,

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.150
like, if this were
a problem, these

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:23.900
would be some solutions,
like unemployment

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.520
compensation, relocation
assistance, training,

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.140
but at the time
it was a problem.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.690
So we can recognize solutions
to potential problems,

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.180
but we don't seem to
recognize the problem when

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.555
it's rising so that we come
up with other solutions.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.565
WILLIAM B.
BONVILLIAN: So Martin,

01:00:43.565 --> 01:00:47.200
a closing thought
for us on Schultze?

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.795
MARTIN: I mean, I thought it
was pretty straightforward.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.490
These kind of growth webs are
very tricky for the government

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:57.850
to focus on, and
also to do it well.

01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:01.867
But having some kind of
function in the innovation space

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:02.950
is also important to have.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.050
So it's really like
being supportive

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:08.170
of the economic environment,
but if you get too close

01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:11.660
you'll burn yourself, in
terms of the complexity.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.530
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Good summary.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.030
All right.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.600
I want to thank our three
discussion leaders for getting

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.120
us off to such a good start.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.340
Good work, team.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:24.970
You set a model for us
at a high threshold.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.432
I think now our classes,
the participation

01:01:27.432 --> 01:01:28.390
is pretty well settled.

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.640
I think we've got a great size.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.157
I can just tell from
the discussion today

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.240
it's going to be terrific.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.365
You guys are going to be great.

01:01:36.365 --> 01:01:38.240
And I think we're going
to have a lot of fun.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.467
So I had a good time last
week, but I'm really reassured

01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:43.550
about where this is going.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.380
So thank you all
for participating.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.090
So I'll see you
on the 28th, and I

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:51.880
will put out a longer-term
list of discussion leaders

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.640
in the interim.

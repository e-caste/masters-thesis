BOGDAN FEDELES: Hi, and welcome
to 5.07 Biochemistry Online,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.150
the biochemistry course
on MIT OpenCourseWare.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.290
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.187
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.270
Now today we're going to
do a really nice problem.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.300
This is Problem 1
in Problem Set 2.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.340
Now, this is a problem
about elucidating

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.280
the primary structure
of a protein.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.890
Problems like this one
that we're about to discuss

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
are a lot of fun because they're
really biochemistry puzzles.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.240
We're given a number of
pieces of data or clues,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.510
if you want, and then
we'd have to use,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450
not only our biochemical
sense, but also

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.390
deduction and elimination
process in order

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.520
to come up with a final answer.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
Well, in practice, elucidating
the primary structure

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
of a protein is now a
largely automated process

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.020
and utilizes high resolution
mass spectrometry.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.270
Some of the traditional
chemical methods

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
that we're discussing here
are still occasionally useful.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.710
But most importantly, the
logical step-wise process

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
through which we analyze
and use each piece of data

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.880
to construct a
big picture result

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
is really representative of
the process by which we make

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.970
discoveries in biochemistry.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.000
Before we begin, let me just
say that this problem assumes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
familiarity with the structures
and abbreviations of the 20

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.850
natural amino acids.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.620
Feel free to pause
this video and review

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.830
the relevant chapters in the
book and the lecture notes

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.067
before continuing.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.630
One important tool that
we have for elucidating

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
the primary structure of
proteins is proteases.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
Proteases are enzymes that can
hydrolyze the peptide bonds

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.800
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.310
Now, proteases that can
cleave in the middle

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.720
of a polypeptide chain are
also called endopeptidases.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.060
Now you notice a
lot of these names

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.920
that end in "ase" denote
enzymes, and peptidase

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.440
means an enzyme that
acts on a peptide.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.300
It's the enzyme that
hydrolyzes the peptide bond.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.400
Endo, in this case,
refers to the fact

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.160
that it acts in the middle
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.800
Now, we're going to be learning
in this problem about trypsin

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.250
and chymotrypsin.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.800
These are proteases that
cleave in the middle

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.060
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.340
They are endopeptidases.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.380
One important
feature of proteases

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.420
is that they are specific.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.610
They don't just cut any which
one peptide bond, but rather

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
they recognize a specific
sequence of amino acids.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.470
In the case of
trypsin, for example,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.880
we are told that it cleaves
adjacent to positively

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940
charged amino acid.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.770
As you know, positively
charged amino acids

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.560
would be lysine or arginine.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710
So trypsin will
always be cutting

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.510
after arginine or lysine.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.850
Let's take a look.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.360
Now, here is a polypeptide
chain with amino acid residues,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.350
R1, R2, R3, R4.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.110
Now, let's look at
this peptide bond

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.240
right here in the
middle of the chain.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.310
Now let's say in
order for trypsin

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.670
to cut, to hydrolyze
this peptide bond,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.700
it means that R2, the amino
acid residue adjacent to it,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.040
should be a positively
charged one.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:11.580
So if R2 is lysine or
arginine, then this bond

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.700
here becomes a good
substrate for trypsin.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.370
And what it's going to do, it's
going to use a water molecule--

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.709
it's going to put here trypsin--

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.710
and it's going to
hydrolyze forming

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.150
a carboxyl end and an amine
end of this peptide bond.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:39.080
So we're getting this
is a carboxyl end

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:53.160
and this is the amine end of
that original peptide bond.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.640
So what I want
you to remember is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.510
that if we're having a
reaction with trypsin

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.640
on a polypeptide chain, then
the carboxy end of the peptide

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.790
that results, which is
this particular amino acid,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.540
is going to be one of
either lysine or arginine.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.100
So in other words
in a trypsin digest,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.760
all the smaller
peptides that we obtain

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.990
are going to end in arginine
or lysine except, of course,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.180
the very end of the
chain, which might

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.450
have a different amino
acid at its carboxyl end.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.320
Now, this consideration we've
just made about the trypsin

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.520
digest, in fact, answers
part 1 of the problem, which

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.110
is asking what is common about
all these peptides generated

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.060
by a trypsin digest.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.580
And as we've just explained,
all these peptides

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.700
should be ending with a
positively charged amino acid

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.440
such as lysine or arginine.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.760
This problem also mentions
another protease chymotrypsin,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.670
which is a protease that
has a different specificity

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.820
from trypsin.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.540
It actually cleaves
after amino acids

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.600
that are either very hydrophobic
and large or aromatic.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.790
So let's write that
down and remember.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.130
So if we were to do a
digest with chymotrypsin,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.560
then our R2, the residue that's
recognized by the protease,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.770
is going to have to be either
aromatic, so phenylalanine,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.380
tyrosine, or tryptophan,
or something that's

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.700
large and hydrophobic such
as leucine, isoleucine,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.450
or even valine sometimes.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.060
Put this in parentheses.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.210
So if any of these residues
are at this position,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.960
R2, then this
protease, chymotrypsin,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.310
is going to generate
two peptides.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.670
And once again, the resulting
peptide, R2 at the carboxy end

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.300
is going to be one
of these amino acids.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.350
That's going to be the signature
of a chymotrypsin digest.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.970
Now, keeping these
things in mind,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.070
we're ready to tackle
the rest of the problem.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.270
Question 2 asks about the use
of DTT, or dithiothreitol.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.990
Now, DTT is a commonly
used reducing agent,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.840
which can reduce disulfide
bridges in proteins.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.160
There are many reasons
why we want to use DTT.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.010
For example, when proteins
form disulfide bridges,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.990
you may shield
certain amino acids

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.020
from being accessible
by proteases,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.090
and therefore, they're
not going to be cleaved

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.850
and we'll get a
mixture of peptides.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.900
So it makes our analysis and
our results very difficult.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.910
Now, disulfide bridges can
also hold two peptides together

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.610
that have no other covalent
attachment between them.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.150
So in that case,
we get one fragment

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.540
instead of two fragments, and
once again, it complicates

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.120
our analysis of the protein.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.580
But more importantly,
because we're typically

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.810
purifying proteins in the
air, in an oxygen atmosphere,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.245
proteins can acquire disulfide
bonds, which weren't there

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:20.100
in the beginning.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.230
So in that case, we can
get very unusual results,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.510
unreproducible and artefactual.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:32.450
That's why using DTT can prevent
formation of spurious disulfide

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.740
bridges.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.039
And finally, DTT is
also useful to tell

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.350
if there were any disulfide
bridges in the protein

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.470
to begin with.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.440
Because if we're
looking at the analysis

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.220
before and after using DTT, we
can tell if the results change,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.900
and that will tell us whether
disulfide bridges were there

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.180
to begin with.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.680
Now, let's take a look
at the DTT chemistry.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:13.090
Here we have a disulfide
bond or bridge in a protein,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.240
and we're going to
treat this with DTT,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.140
which looks like this.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.440
This is DTT or dithiothreitol.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.800
Now, if we substitute the
SH groups with OH's, you

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.340
notice we're going to have
four OH's and four carbons.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.480
That's just an alcohol
derived from a sugar, which

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.050
is called threose That's why
the threitol part of the name.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.550
All right.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.320
So when we do this
chemical reaction,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.110
this disulfide bridge is going
to transfer between the two

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.440
sulfur atoms of DTT.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.780
They're going to form a
intramolecular sulfide bond.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:12.000
So our cysteines are
going to get reduced,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.590
and from DTT, we're going to
get this intramolecular sulfide.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.910
And because entropical
considerations,

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.440
make the formation
of the six-member

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.610
ring very, very easy, then
this equilibrium will typically

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.520
shift to the right.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.400
Of course, we're also using
vast quantities of DTT

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.360
to make sure that the entire
protein becomes reduced,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.290
and then our agent is going
to pick up this [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.400
off the bond.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.560
This sums up the question
2 of the problem.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.600
Next, we're going to
look at distinguishing

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.940
between a couple of
different peptides

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.660
that we generate during
our analysis of our mystery

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.770
protein.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.810
So we're told that we're
isolating by HPLC peptides

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.970
of the following composition.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.590
One has tryptophan,
phenylalanine,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:26.730
valine, aspartate,
lysine, cysteine.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.780
That's peptide one.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.820
Another one has phenylalanine,
serine, cysteine,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.290
and an unknown amino acid.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.251
Finally, the third one
has alanine and lysine.

00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:40.750
All right.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.320
Now, obviously, these peptides
have different compositions,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.751
so if you could just put them
through mass spectrometry,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.250
we're going to get
different masses,

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.550
so we can tell very
quickly which one is which.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.380
But if we don't have
mass spec available,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.300
we can also tell them apart
only using UV-Vis spectroscopy.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.530
So all you need to remember
is that an amino acid

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.040
like tryptophan
that we have here,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.650
W, has a very strong absorption
in the 280 to 300 nanometers.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.220
Whereas, amino acids
like phenylalanine,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.960
present here or here, they
absorb only around 260

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.310
nanometers.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.340
Most of the other amino acids
don't absorb in this range

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.670
at all.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:35.458
So if we were to plot the UV-Vis
spectra of these peptides,

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.720
this is going to
be our absorption,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.840
and this is going to be lambda
in nanometers, the wavelength.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.140
So let's look in the
range from 200 to 400.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.700
300 is about here.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.930
250 is about here.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.150
And let's label these.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:03.680
Let's say this peptide is
red, this peptide is blue,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.860
and this one is green.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.460
All right.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.190
So now the red
peptide, as I told you,

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.310
contains both tryptophan
and phenylalanine,

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.370
so it's going to
absorb both around 260

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.770
and both around 280 to 300.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.420
So it's going to have a
pretty big hump in this area

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.860
from 250 to 300.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.130
Now, the blue peptide
only has phenylalanine,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.020
so above 280 or so, nanometer
is going to drop off.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.200
So it's going to
look more like this,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.210
whereas, the green one, well,
it has neither phenylalanine

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.540
or tryptophan, so
below 240 or so,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.830
it's going to have no
UV absorption at all.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.940
So it's going to
drop off right here.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.540
So basically, if
we're just looking,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.980
say, around 260 nanometers,
we should see a stronger peak

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.920
from the red peptide and a
weaker peak from the blue one.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.180
But if we're going
to look around 300,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.320
we should only see
the red peptide.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.160
So by just using the
UV-Vis absorption,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.240
we can tell these
three peptides apart.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.660
Now we're ready to figure out
the structure of our mystery

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.430
protein.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.980
This is exactly what the last
part of the problem is asking.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.400
So we're going to take each
one of the clues provided--

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.750
A, B, C, and D--

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.820
and analyze and see
what information we can

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.800
derive from each one of them.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.050
The first piece of
information that we're given

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.870
is the result of
a total hydrolysis

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.695
of our peptide
with six molar HCl.

00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:44.260
So we're told we get
the following amino acid

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.338
composition.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:57.180
We get two phenylalanines, one
methionine, alanine, valine,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:05.630
two lysines, one serine, two
cysteine, and one aspartate.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.990
Now, recall this is not
a comprehensive list

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.020
because the hydrolysis
and six smaller HCl

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.690
may destroy some
of the amino acids.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.080
And specifically, we
know for sure something

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.997
like tryptophan,
threonine, and tyrosine.

00:15:22.997 --> 00:15:24.830
They're going to be
destroyed, and we're not

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.920
going to see them here.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.060
So these amino acids may still
be present in our protein,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.880
but we're not going to be able
to see them in this situation.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.440
Now, let's analyze
these amino acids

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.500
and see what we can
derive from this.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.700
So first of all,
we have cysteines.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.770
So two cysteines,
it means our protein

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.770
can form disulfide bridges.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.440
So from the get
go, two cysteine,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.170
it means we can form an
internal disulfide bridge

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.570
or our protein contains a
disulfide bridge between two

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.480
otherwise unconnected peptides.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.390
So here are some possibilities.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.020
For example, our
peptide is one chain,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.590
and our cysteines are
not actually connected

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.600
by a disulfide bridge.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.660
Another possibility is we
do have a disulfide bridge

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.770
between them, like that.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.960
Or yet another possibility is
that we have two pieces, two

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.740
polypeptide chains, and
the disulfide bridge

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.940
is the only thing that's
holding them together.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.760
Now, in each one of
these cases, obviously,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.300
these polypeptide
chains are oriented.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.582
So in one end, they're going
to have the amine group.

00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:50.770
Let me draw it here, NH3.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.680
Here we're going to have
two, and the other end

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.735
is going to be the
carboxyl group, COO minus.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.240
And once again, in
this case, we're

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.558
going to have two of them.

00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:12.359
All right.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:17.619
Now, how can we narrow down from
these couple of possibilities?

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.349
Well, the fact that we're
getting two lysines here

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.210
is a very important clue.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.730
Now remember, we're told that
our peptide, this mystery

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.190
protein, it actually comes as
a result of a trypsin digest.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.300
And if you recall our
discussion earlier,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.550
we said that upon
trypsin digest,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.130
all the smaller peptides
that were obtained

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.270
will end in lysine
or an arginine.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.520
The fact that we have
two lysines here,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.570
it means both of
them they need to be

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:58.500
at the carboxy ends of peptides.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.080
Because if they were in
the middle of a chain,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.090
the trypsin would have
cut that chain in half.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:16.400
So two lysines means we've
got to have two carboxy ends.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.400
So therefore, this seems to be
the only possibility in which

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.170
we can accommodate two lysines.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.980
Basically, the two carboxy
ends that we see here,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.580
each one has to be a lysine.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.250
This possibility only
has one carboxy end,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.710
so the other lysine
that we have to place

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.860
will not be at the
end, so would not

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.860
be compatible with
a trypsin digest.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.660
Same applies for this case.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:52.790
So these possibilities are
not consistent with our data.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.920
So we know already
that our protein must

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.710
look like this, two
polypeptide chains,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.680
each one ends with
lysine, and there

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.660
must be a disulfide bridge.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.430
The second clue we're given
is that the Edman degradation

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.430
of the protein yields valine.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.770
Now, as you know,
Edman degradation

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.730
is a chemical reaction by
which we can digest the protein

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.760
from the N terminus,
from the amino terminus

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.920
of a polypeptide chain.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.880
Now as you recall, we have
established in the first part

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.450
that we have two amino
termini in our protein.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.990
So the fact that we only get one
amino acid and that is valine,

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.390
it says that the
other amino terminus

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.760
might be blocked or
somehow unavailable

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.540
for the Edman degradation.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.800
So let's update the
structure of our protein

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.550
to take into account
the second clue.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.300
So we said we have two
polypeptide chains.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.670
There's a disulfide
bond in between them.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.580
Now, each one of them
ends with a lysine.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.450
This is a carboxy
end, and now we

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.020
know from the Edman degradation
that amino end of one of them

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.730
has to be valine.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.090
The other one-- we're going
to put a box like that--

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.200
is a blocked end.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.110
So the amino terminus
is not available.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.420
So this is as much as we can
tell from these first two

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.090
clues.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.510
We're given the products
of the chymotrypsin

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.810
digest of our protein
after it was previously

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.910
treated with DTT.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.690
So we know first DTT is going
to cleave the disulfide bond,

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.230
and then chymotrypsin,
as we talked previously,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.040
is going to cut after large,
hydrophobic, or aromatic

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.610
amino acids.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.751
Now, we're told we're getting
five smaller peptides.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.500
Let's take a look.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.500
Here are the five fragments.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:09.900
One is tryptophan, valine; one
is cysteine, phenylalanine,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.690
another one is aspartate
lysine, another one

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.700
is methionine, alanine,
cysteine, and lysine;

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.830
and finally, the last one
has serine, phenylalanine,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.920
and something that's
not an amino acid.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.428
It's going to make
it like a small x.

00:21:33.428 --> 00:21:35.390
All right.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.280
Now, from what we know
about chymotrypsin digest,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.610
we should be able to orient
these peptides basically

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.580
to tell which amino acid
is at the N terminus

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.070
and which amino acid is at the
C terminus of each one of them.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.680
Now the first one.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.830
Well, we know from
the second clue

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.770
that valine is at
the N terminus,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.630
so that makes it pretty easy.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.770
Then the sequence has to be V-W.
So valine is the N terminus,

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.070
W is the C terminus,
and as we said,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.470
tryptophan is one of the
amino acids recognized

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.870
by chymotrypsin, so
it's going to end up

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.610
at the carboxy terminus.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.540
C-F, that has to go C
and F, phenylalanine,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.950
another chymotrypsin
amino acid that's

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.460
left of this carboxy terminus.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.070
D-K. Now, neither
of these amino acids

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:38.680
is recognized by chymotrypsin,
but we remember from clue one

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.390
that D-K must be the
carboxy terminus.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.970
So the sequence can only be D-K.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.420
Now, here M, A, C,
and K, none of these

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.930
is actually on our recognition
list for chymotrypsin,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.410
but once again, we know that
K must be in the carboxy end.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.840
So for now we're
going to have M, A,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.240
and C in a particular order,
which we cannot establish just

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.940
yet and K at the carboxy end.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.390
And finally, we
do an S, F and x.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.570
Well, x is not
even an amino acid,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.760
and F is an amino acid that's
left of the carboxy terminus

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:26.110
by chymotrypsin, so it's
probably x, S, and F. Now,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.580
what about x?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:41.780
We're told that x is not an
amino acid and is hydrophobic

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.865
and it has a molecular
weight of 256 Daltons.

00:23:50.381 --> 00:23:50.880
All right.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.860
So in order to
figure out what x is,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.520
we have to read back the
beginning of the problem, which

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.460
tells us that we're looking
at a protein that's associated

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.140
with a plasma membrane.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.420
And one way for proteins
to associate with a plasma

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.370
membrane is to be modified,
to incorporate a fatty acid,

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.230
such as palmitate.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:17.040
So perhaps x, which is blocking
the N terminus of this peptide

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.410
is a fatty acid.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.180
Now, the general
formula for fatty acids

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.160
is something like this,
CH3 CH2 repeated, say,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.660
n times, and then COOH.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.680
So let's see what would
be the fatty acid that

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.890
has the molecular
weight 256 Daltons?

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.780
Well, the mass of a
methyl group is 15.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.800
The mass of this carboxylate
is 45, so we have about 60

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:58.290
plus 14n equals 256
or 14n equals 196.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.130
Therefore, n is 14.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.000
So the fatty acid that
would fit these criteria--

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.980
it's hydrophobic, it
has a mass of 256--

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:16.770
will be CH3, CH2 14 times
COOH, or the fatty acid

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.280
was 16 carbons.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.830
This is palmitic acid.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.580
Now, the answer that
we got, palmitic acid,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.730
was anticipated in the
text of the problem

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.380
because it gave us an example
one way to associate proteins

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.630
to the plasma
membrane is to form

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.960
a covalent linkage with a
fatty acid such as palmitate.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.400
But how does a protein
associate with a plasma

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.910
membrane when it has a palmitic
acid residue as part of it?

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.580
Well, let's take a
look at a diagram.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.670
Here we have a representation
of the plasma membrane,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.730
where we have the phospholipids
like the hydrophilic head

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.410
pointing inside and outside the
cell and the hydrophobic tails

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:09.150
of the fatty acids
lined up to each other.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.880
Now, imagine we have
a protein that's

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.450
modified to contain one
of these fatty acids.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.100
Then this fatty acid can
just insert right next

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.680
to the phospholipids
of the plasma membrane.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.460
And that way it tethers
the protein right

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.500
at the plasma membrane.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.260
The final clue that we're
given in order to figure out

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.540
the structure of
our mystery protein

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.770
is the digest with an
inorganic agent this time.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.710
It's called cyanogen bromide.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.340
Cyanogen bromide reacts quite
specifically with methionines,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.760
and it cleaves the peptide
bond after methionine

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.750
leaving behind an
unnatural amino acid called

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.570
a homoserine lactone.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.730
Now, let's take a
look at what happens

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.340
when we treat our protein
with cyanogen bromide.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:09.266
So we're told we're getting
the following peptides, A, K

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:32.470
and W, F, V, D, K, C and F, S,
C, and an unnatural amino acid.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:37.120
As I just explained to you, the
unnatural amino acid probably

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.250
is this homoserine lactone.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:51.680
So it's most likely,
instead of this amino acid

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.170
in the actual sequence,
we had a methionine.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.010
So we know these four residues--

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.720
F, S, C, and M--

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.260
go together.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.310
All right.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.070
Now, we can start putting
together the clues

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:13.020
from part 3 and 4 and try to
figure out the final structure

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.700
of our protein.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:26.210
So the peptide A, K, we know
has to have K at the C terminus.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.890
Now, from part 3, we
found out that there

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.430
was a peptide that
contained M, A, C, and K,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.380
after the chymotrypsin digest.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.553
So now we know K has
to be the carboxy end

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:45.870
and A has to be right
before K, so in order

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.080
to get an A-K
peptide, then A has

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.810
to be right after
methionine because that's

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.035
where cyanogen bromide is going
to cleave the peptide bond.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.010
So the only sequence
that we can have here is

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.220
going to be C followed
by M followed by A

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.540
followed by K. So when we
treat the cyanogen bromide,

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.420
we're going to be cleaving
this bond between M and A,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.460
generating M as a
homoserine lactone.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:21.730
Now, we also know that M has
to be in this small peptide,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.390
and we know it has to
be C, M as a sequence.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:31.540
So therefore, S and F have
to be on the amino terminus

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.370
of this peptide.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.100
And we also have a
clue from part 3, which

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:43.950
said that S, F, and this
non amino acid moiety

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:49.180
were in the same peptide.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.970
So from here we said that,
well, the sequence there, it's

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.280
probably x modifying the amino
S and then F with a carboxy end.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.760
So putting these
three things together,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.400
we can come up with a sequence
for this strand, which

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:16.300
is going to be x, S,
F, then C, M and then A

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:23.150
and K. So this is probably
one of the peptide chains

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.670
in our mystery protein.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.350
Then, of course,
the other is going

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.600
to be composed of
these amino acids.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.980
Now, we already know something
about the sequence of these.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:39.130
For example, we know V
goes before W. We also

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:50.600
know D goes before K, and also
know C goes before F. Now, we

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.880
know this has to be the carboxy
end of the peptide chain.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.220
Let's write it here, COO minus.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.720
And V has to be the amino end.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.230
So then C-F, there's no other
way, has to be in the middle.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.210
So the only possible
sequence for our second chain

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:27.950
is going to be V,
W, C, F, D, and K.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.250
Now that we've established
the exact sequence

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.200
of each one of these
peptide chains,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.450
then we can put together
the final structure

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.890
of our mystery protein.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:42.344
So I'm going to transcribe these
here, the first chain V, W, C,

00:31:42.344 --> 00:31:48.980
F, D, and K. And we know
the cysteine is going

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:54.940
to have our disulfide bridge
to the other cysteine, which

00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:03.770
goes C, M, A, K, and
then F, and then S.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:10.370
And now we know the N
terminus of this peptide,

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:19.990
we're going to have our fatty
acid residue CH2 14 times CH3.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:29.480
So let's just mark, once
again, the carboxy ends here

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.260
and the amino end here.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:41.980
So this is the final
answer for our problem

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.700
and the structure of
our mystery peptide.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.590
Well, that's it
for this problem.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.940
I hope you enjoyed this
little protein mystery hunt.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.360
Now, remember that the
strategy that we used here

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.850
in which we logically string
together pieces of data

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.780
to build a big picture, it's
really the same strategy

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.530
that has been used and is
being used right now to advance

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.880
our knowledge about living
systems and their underlying

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.030
biochemistry.te equations.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.500
What I'm going to
do is just show you

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.230
a picture of how
this theory helps

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.170
us think about these
catalytic transformations

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.920
and then how this picture helps
us think more specifically

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.320
about these amazing
rate accelerations

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.850
that we actually observe.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:33.430
OK, so I can't remember
what's on the next slide,

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.280
but this is a picture
you often see when you're

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.240
thinking about catalysis.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.310
So this is chemical catalysis,
but again, chemical catalysis,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.060
biological catalysis, really
the same basic principles

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:59.190
hold that we have
some substrates A

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:05.090
and B going to products
and what's required.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.370
So I think all of
this is intuitive,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.880
but if you have two
things coming together,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.340
they have to come together
in exactly the right way

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.890
to be able to make a bond.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.810
They have to remove all the
solvent from outside them.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.420
They have to come
together with enough force

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.050
to be able to get over the
barrier, whatever it is,

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.770
to break one bond and
to form a new bond.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:35.630
So that's true of all
reactions and everybody faces

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:40.250
the same issues in terms
of conversion of substrate

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.600
into products.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.030
And the highest point
along the reaction

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.700
coordinate-- so
this is what we call

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.370
a reaction coordinate diagram.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.130
And this is energy.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.940
So the highest point along the
reaction coordinate diagram

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.930
is called the
transition state-- TS.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.060
This is transition state theory.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.390
OK, TS theory.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.180
And this is where-- this is
the point where we can ever

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.879
isolate it because
this is a point where

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:17.170
all the chemistry is happening.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.210
The bonds are being
made and broken.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.690
And the lifetime I just showed
you on the previous slide

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.530
is fast-- fentaseconds.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.710
So you can never isolate
a transition state.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.420
Everything needs to be aligned.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.010
That doesn't come
free of charge.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.170
You have to do a lot of
work to get to the stage

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.420
where you can get this
chemistry to happen.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.430
That's what our
catalysts are doing.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:42.020
And then bang, the reaction
is over at that time.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.130
So this is another way of
describing the transition

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.870
state of the reaction.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.260
And in reality,
this is the cartoon

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:58.270
you see in most introductory
textbooks that are describing

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.590
rates of reaction.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.100
But the reaction coordinate is
much, much more complicated.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.250
And that's true in
enzymatic reactions as well.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.320
So it's true of
chemical reactions,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.001
it's true enzymatic reactions.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.570
So you might have
a plus b, and they

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:22.240
might form two or
three intermediates

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.580
along the reaction
pathway where you

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.410
have many transitions-- you
have many transition states

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.990
along the reaction pathway.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:39.610
And each of these transitions
states would be non-isolable.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.360
But what about these
little valleys?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.610
These little valleys are
where you might have a chance

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.810
to see an intermediate during
the conversion of a plus

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.450
b into p plus q.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.830
So an intermediate--
and if you're

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.430
interested in studying
catalysis and the chemistry

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.470
of the reaction and
you need to define

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.350
what these intermediates
are, they can be high

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.930
or that could be
lower in energy.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.900
They may be easy to isolate,
not easy to isolate.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:14.230
But they have all
covalent bonds intact.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.489
So in contrast to the
transition state where

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.466
the bonds are being
made and broken,

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:20.590
you can never isolate this.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.980
You have a chance to be able--
if you're clever and creative,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.130
which people that
study mechanisms are,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.920
you can actually look
at the intermediates

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.409
along the reaction coordinate.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.485
So that's a reaction
coordinate diagram.

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:35.860
We're going to
come back to these

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.290
because I think they really help
us to conceptualize how enzymes

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.510
can go about achieving these
fantastic rate accelerations.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:52.780
So from transition
state theory, one

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.400
assumes the following--
I'm not going

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.889
to go through the
details of this at all.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.980
But the key point that
one needs to think about

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.880
in transition state
theory is that--

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.250
and this was first put
forth by Linus Pauling.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.270
Who's Linus Pauling?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.730
He's my hero.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.920
OK, Linus Pauling,
he's the vitamin C guy.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.630
He lost it when he got
old, but in the early days,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.540
he's the one that could take
a polypeptide chain-- just

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.510
a string of amino
acids-- and he sat there

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.950
and he played with it.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.510
And lo and behold,
he says, we're

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.880
going to have alpha
helices in proteins.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.930
How amazing is that?

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.820
You've heard me talk
about him before.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.750
He was the one that I think
conceptualized-- first

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:36.260
conceptualized-- how an enzyme
might catalyze a reaction.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.610
What do you want to do
to catalyze a reaction?

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.640
You want to lower this barrier.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.100
So how do you lower the barrier?

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.640
You don't want the enzyme to
bind the substrates tightly,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.320
and I'll come back
to this in a minute.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.790
You want to bind the
transition state tightly.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:59.170
So he put forth in the
1940s that the way enzymes

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.510
might be able to catalyze
their reactions is

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.320
by tightly binding--
uniquely and tightly binding

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.850
the transition state
of the reaction.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.410
And I think that turns out
to be a really good way

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.010
to conceptualize most
enzymatic reactions.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.950
Now, transition
state theory tells

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.430
us, which again is
not so appealing to me

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:26.060
but it works to describe
most experimental data,

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.050
that the ground state-- so this
would be the ground state--

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.565
is in equilibrium with
the transition state.

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:34.190
So you might ask
yourself, how the heck

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.064
can you ever be in
equilibrium with something

00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:37.880
with such a short half life?

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.920
That's a good question to ask.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.240
But in fact, this framework--
transition state theory--

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.030
allows us to able
to explain almost

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.280
all the experimental
observations

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.850
that we make as both
chemists and biochemists.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.607
So this goes through and
derives that equation, which

00:36:55.607 --> 00:36:56.690
I'm not going to do today.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.606
In the old days, I used
to spend a lot of time

00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:00.260
deriving equations.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.860
Nowadays, I don't derive
equations anymore.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.590
But the key equation that
you need to think about

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.580
is shown here.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:16.550
And the consequences of this
equation are quite simple.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:22.850
It tells you that the rate
constant for the reaction-- so

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:29.820
from transition state
theory, the rate

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.151
constant for the reaction.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.140
And where is this rate constant?

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.350
Where does this rate
constant come from?

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:45.670
A is going to some product p.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.090
You can measure
it experimentally.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.560
So k observed is an
experimentally measurable

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.650
parameter is equal to a
bunch of constants called

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.110
the transmission coefficient.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.130
This should be a cappa.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.460
Boltzmann's
constant, temperature

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.050
in degrees Kelvin,
Planck's constant times

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:14.440
e to the minus delta
g dagger over rg.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.624
So this is the equation.

00:38:15.624 --> 00:38:16.415
This is a constant.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.970
This is Planck's constant,
Boltzmann's constant.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.590
This you can measure
experimentally.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.730
Cappa is telling you basically--
the transmission coefficient

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.940
is telling you the frequency
that this transition state

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.210
breaks down to form
products versus going back

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:38.130
to starting materials and in
general, is on the order of one

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.850
in most reactions.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.120
And so the key thing to remember
from this equation, which

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.280
explains the data and helps
us to think about catalysis,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.910
is that as you increase
the rate of the reaction,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.510
it's inversely related to
the activation barrier.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.120
So what you want to do,
this equation tells you,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.840
is you lower this barrier.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.140
The rate of your reaction
becomes faster and faster.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.450
So the whole goal is,
then, to figure out

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.740
how to lower the barrier.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.290
If you can lower the
barrier, this theory

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.310
predicts that the rate of
your reaction will be faster.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.980
So that's what we
want to be able to do.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.760
The rate constant
is inversely related

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.880
to the activation barrier.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.324
And so now let's look at an
enzyme system specifically.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.130
So I'm going to draw the
same kind of reaction

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:45.040
coordinate that we've drawn over
there for a chemical reaction.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.520
And I'm going to use
a simple equation.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.890
E is the enzyme, s is
the substrate forms

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.750
an enzyme substrate complex.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.400
The substrate
binds in the region

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.340
that we call the
active site over here.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:11.110
Somehow, the enzyme is able to
convert itself into product.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.560
Now, most reactions are much
more complicated than this.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.601
You have many substrates.

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:17.260
You have many products.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.540
But it doesn't affect
anything in terms

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.550
of thinking about the problem.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.900
And then in the end,
the product dissociates.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.640
So that's a simple reaction.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.640
You get something in there,
a catalyst works on it,

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.350
it gets converted to
the desired product,

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.170
and the product is released.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.470
So what I've told you
now a couple of times

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.730
is that enzymes have
evolved to such an extent

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.090
that often the physical
steps and not the chemistry

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.140
is rate limiting.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.290
So what are the physical steps?

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.920
Here are the physical steps.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.770
Enzyme finding
substrate and solution,

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.250
that's a physical step.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.800
What is limited by?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.900
It's limited by
diffusion control.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.230
How fast can they find
each other in solution?

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.840
That's the number 10
to the 8 per molar

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.500
per second that limits most
enzyme-based reactions that I

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.020
showed you several slides ago.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.670
What about this?

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.100
We have product dissociation.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.510
What about product dissociation?

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.670
That's a physical step too.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.640
You made the product
sitting around,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.320
but in order for the
enzyme to turn over, again,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.240
to free up the active
site, the product

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.410
has to come off so it can
bind another substrate.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.390
And here is the chemistry.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.810
Ah, that's what I care about.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.430
But what happens, now, is
that if these steps are

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.120
rate limiting, then you
can't see the chemistry.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.240
So it's really challenging,
often really challenging,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.600
to study the chemistry
of a reaction

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.420
because the rate limiting
steps have nothing

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.800
to do with the chemistry.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.560
So let me just draw a diagram.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.754
So you can draw a reaction
coordinate diagram.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:16.530
And so what you have is
some enzyme plus substrate

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:22.164
and it can form an
enzyme substrate complex.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.160
You have a transition
state of your reaction.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.490
The enzyme product
complex can then

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:37.080
dissociate to form
enzyme plus product.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.940
So what you need to
think about if you're

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.940
thinking about how to
accelerate the reaction is

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.797
what is the bottleneck
in the overall reaction?

00:42:44.797 --> 00:42:46.380
You don't want to
start mucking around

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.910
with something that
doesn't control

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:48.980
the rate of the reaction.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.900
So you need to know what
the rate limiting step

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.670
is in the reaction.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:59.580
And the rate limiting step
is the highest barrier

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.121
along the reaction coordinate.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:17.760
OK, now I've already told you
that this is a simple case.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.210
We have one substrate getting
converted into product.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.280
Most enzymatic reactions are
going to have many barriers.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.380
And so in order to affect the
overall rate of the reaction,

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.690
you need to figure out
what's rate limiting,

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:37.200
and somehow the
enzyme has figured out

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.710
how to lower the barrier to make
this reaction easier to occur.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:46.560
Remember, I just told you that
the rate constant is inversely

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.880
related to this
activation barrier.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.060
So if we can lower
this barrier somehow,

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.310
what we're going to see, if
we can lower this barrier,

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:01.460
now we have a lower overall
rate of the reaction.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.430
So this theory
allows us to think

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.200
about what we need to do to
make these catalysts actually

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.070
work with rate constants of
10 to 6 to 10 to 15 times

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:18.000
faster than
non-catalyzed reactions.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.970
And I want to say one other
thing before you move on.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.510
As with everything,
I think it's good

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.790
that we're in a field
that's rapidly changing.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.370
Remember, I told you have
to think about dynamics.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.170
We no longer think about
a single reaction barrier.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.360
That's in most of
the textbooks now.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.710
Really what we think about is
we bring dynamics into this.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.950
I told you things
outside the active site

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.310
can modulate what's going
on inside the active site.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.610
What we think about is
a reaction landscape.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.750
And so one has many barriers
that one has to get over.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.921
Almost all reactions
involve multiple barriers.

00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.170
So you've got to figure out
which one is rate limiting

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.550
and lower that
activation barrier.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.790
And enzymes, if you think
about this, they're huge.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.920
Do they all fold
exactly the same way?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.270
No.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.710
So we always think we
have a homogeneous enzyme.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.480
No.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.310
If any of you work
in UROPs, you'll

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.630
find that out pretty fast.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.250
You use recombinant technology
to fold things inside the cell.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.830
They don't all fold right.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.510
So you have all
mixtures of things.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.700
And so you get a
reaction landscape.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:38.970
And so this axis is
bringing in the dynamics

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.740
that I told you about
earlier on that you

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.560
need to think about-- the
conformational changes that

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.410
occur every step along
the reaction pathway.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:51.000
The enzyme is moving
at all kinds of steps,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.300
reorienting everything to get
the chemistry exactly right.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:02.220
So what I want to do now
is-- so that gives you

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:07.110
a way to conceptualize
rate accelerations.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.790
Now what I want
to do is tell you

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:13.440
what the major mechanisms are
that the enzyme uses to enhance

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.730
the rates of these reactions.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.660
How do we lower these
energy barriers?

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.490
So let me see.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:22.100
I need to start
erasing somewhere.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.263
OK, so we're on the
third bullet over here.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.540
Mechanisms of catalysis.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.300
And what we're going
to be talking about

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.070
is multiple mechanisms
of catalysis.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.590
We're going to be talking
about binding energy, which

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.120
is the one people have most
trouble thinking about.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:55.950
We're going to be talking about
general acid, general base

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.350
catalysis.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:02.580
And we're going to be talking
about covalent catalysis.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.006
And we will see
that over the course

00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:07.380
of the rest of
the semester, when

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.810
we start talking about
metabolic pathways,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.590
all of these mechanisms
are used in almost

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.430
all enzyme catalyzed
reactions to give us

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:20.785
these tremendous
rate accelerations.

00:47:20.785 --> 00:47:24.060
What I want to do-- that's
the first time I did that.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.106
That wasn't too bad.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.490
OK, so what are the
mechanisms of catalysis?

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:46.154
How do we get 10 to the 6 to
10 to the 15 accelerations?

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.870
And so the first
thing, and I think

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:56.250
the one that really is unique
to enzyme catalysts compared

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.640
to small inorganic
or organic molecules,

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.550
is the use of binding
energy in catalysis.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.610
So this is the one--
and this is also

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.450
the one that's thought to
contribute the greatest

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:13.700
amount to these factors
of up to 10 to 15.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:23.200
So binding energy in catalysis,
and what does that mean?

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.100
What do we need to think about?

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.370
So the enzyme binds
to a substrate.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:34.470
If we take this simple
case, we need it to bind.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.210
We need it to bind specifically.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.740
So that's a key
part of the enzyme

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.020
that we haven't gotten
to yet-- specificity.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.280
But what if it bound its
substrate really tightly?

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.220
Do you think that would be good?

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.220
No.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.500
So it's not good
because what does it do?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:57.090
If it took all of the spinach
changing off of your substrate

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.820
and made hydrogen bonds and
Van Der Waals interactions,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.000
all the weak
non-covalent interactions

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.280
we spent a half
a lecture talking

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:11.691
about four or five lectures
ago, what would happen is you

00:49:11.691 --> 00:49:12.690
would have type binding.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.520
You would have lower energy.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:20.100
But what does that then do
to the activation barrier?

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.580
It increases the
activation barrier.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:37.510
So the binding energy is the
free energy released when

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.400
enzyme combines with substrate.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.080
But the key is that
this bind energy is not

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.420
used to bind completely.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.410
It's used for catalysis.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:50:06.690
So this energy is used
both to bind substrate

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.524
and-- and this is the key
thing-- for catalysis.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.100
So what do we want to be able
to do and how does it do this?

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.100
So if we look at this, if
we look at our reaction

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.870
coordinate diagram over here,
we don't want to bind substrate

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.510
tightly because this is the
biggest barrier-- the rate

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.450
limiting step along
the reaction pathway.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.000
What we want to do is
lower this barrier.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.460
So how can we lower the barrier?

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:43.020
We can lower the barrier by
stabilizing the transition

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.060
state.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.350
That now makes this
barrier-- probably

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.365
can't read anything now, but
that makes this barrier lower.

00:50:51.365 --> 00:50:53.790
How's another way you
could lower the barrier?

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:57.350
You could lower the barrier
by straining the substrate

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.520
to look more like
the transition state.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.100
So you could strain the
substrate in this form,

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.260
and now, again, you would
have a lower barrier compared

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.640
to that barrier.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:14.610
So you're going to use this
binding energy to stabilize

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.460
a transition state.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:31.590
So we want to use binding energy
to stabilize the transition

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:39.700
state to de-stabilize-- any
of these or all of these

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:51.490
could be true-- de-stabilize
the ground state-- G-S.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:55.060
Or what else do you need
to do to get a reaction

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.030
to work if you have one or
two substrates or even one

00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:59.040
substrate?

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.075
Your molecules in
solution are all solvated.

00:52:02.075 --> 00:52:04.450
What you need to be able to
do is get rid of the solvent.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.240
If you have two substrates, you
have to bring them together.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.420
You have to bring them together
at the right orientation.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.940
That doesn't come
free of charge.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.110
You have to get the
energy from somewhere,

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.540
and the energy is proposed to
come from this binding energy.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.270
So the binding
energy is not used

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.250
to completely bind
the substrate,

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:24.820
but to do all of these
things to get your substrates

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.680
ready to form product.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:39.380
So you can dissolvate and
bring reactants together.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.620
And you can freeze out
rotational, translational

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.200
entropy.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.610
So you're getting everything
ready for the reaction

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.790
to happen.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.900
So in this case, then, let me
just erase this and make this

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.150
so that this is clearer.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:06.000
What you could have, now, is
you can-- so in the beginning,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.050
this is the barrier.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:11.820
If you stabilize the transition
state, this becomes a barrier.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.760
If you de-stabilize
the ground state,

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.580
then this becomes the barrier.

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:21.000
So what we're trying to
do is lower this barrier

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.630
to get the reaction to work.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:28.980
And so the major
way that we do this

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.330
is by using the interactions
between the enzymes

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:36.240
of the weak non-covalent
interactions between the enzyme

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.300
and substrate to help
us do these things

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.570
to enhance catalysis.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:48.350
So that's one of the major
mechanisms of catalysis.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.510
A second-- and this
type of catalysis

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.120
is unique to proteins.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.410
So the two types of
catalysis are used widely

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.600
in organic or
inorganic chemistry

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.270
when you're designing
your catalyst.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.590
I mean, when you're designing
a catalyst substrate binding,

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:14.130
a small molecule, a big product
release is still an issue.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.070
If you go and read the
organometallic literature,

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.350
people have trouble with
product release all the time.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.180
So the issues in catalysis
are exactly the same

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.790
in biochemistry as they are
in organic and inorganic.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.460
But now we have to deal
with this big protein, which

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.070
has these unique
properties, one of which

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.210
is that the whole protein is
playing a key role in catalysis

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:40.770
and allowing everything to
align within tenths of angstroms

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.770
to make these reactions work
really efficiently, which

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.560
chemists can't do yet.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.380
And I don't think we'll
ever be able to design it,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.340
but we can evolve catalysts
to become better and better

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.930
so that they can
do the same thing.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:58.560
That's the beauty of proteins
is you can evolve them to become

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.830
better and better catalysts.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.790
So the second mechanism--
so the first mechanism

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.390
is binding energy.

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.980
The second mechanism-- I can't
remember whether they're using

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.940
I's or 2's.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:22.960
The second mechanism is general
acid, general base catalysis.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.050
Now, as a chemist,
what do you learn

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.790
about catalyzing reactions?

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.270
Well, one way you could do
it is with a big fat proton.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.510
Protons are pretty good at
helping you catalyze reactions

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:44.310
if you go back and think
about chemical transformations

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:47.580
or hydroxide ions.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.270
What are the concentration
of protons and hydroxide ions

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.540
in aqueous solution of pH 7?

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.790
10 to the minus 7 molar.

00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:00.300
So you don't have much
protons and hydroxide

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.620
ions in the active site.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.380
So even though these
are very good catalysts

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.510
that organic chemists
and inorganic chemists

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.579
use all the time, they're
using them in organic solvents,

00:56:09.579 --> 00:56:11.370
you can argue the active
site of the enzyme

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.530
is more like an organic solvent.

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:18.730
But anyhow, this type of
catalysis is called specific.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.360
So when you see specific
acid or based catalysis--

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.560
where does the general acid
and base catalysis come from?

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.200
It comes from the side
chain of your amino acids.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.980
So remember, the second
or third lecture I said,

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.710
oh, here are all
the amino acids.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.520
Here are all the side chains.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.310
You really shouldn't know
all of your amino acids.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.680
It's a basic vocabulary
of all of biochemistry,

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.710
and the pKas of all
the side chains.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:45.830
Why?

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:46.900
That's why.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.020
Because you can't understand
anything about catalysis

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.540
without knowing what these
side chains of the enzymes

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:54.790
are actually doing.

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.500
So the general acid
and base catalysis

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:03.930
come from the side chains
of your amino acids.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:07.710
So what side chains do you have?

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.400
You can have carboxylates.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.225
Anybody know what the
pKa of a carboxylate is?

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:16.280
Hey, Boggin, what is it?

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.894
STUDENT: Four to five.

00:57:17.894 --> 00:57:19.310
JOANNE STUBBE:
Good, four to five.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.879
See, he remembers.

00:57:20.879 --> 00:57:21.920
You could have imidazole.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:31.850
This has a pKa at neutral pH.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.580
Anyhow, you need
to go back and look

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.770
at what the groups are that
can be involved in catalysis.

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.790
And chemists, for
decades, have studied

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.150
how you can use general
acid and base catalysis

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.160
to give you rate enhancements.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.850
Now, what I haven't told you is
the amount of rate enhancement

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:53.290
And so people over the
years have measured

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:57.230
that with binding energy, you
can get factors of 10 to the 8.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.100
If you look at general acid
base catalysis from all

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.080
the organic and
inorganic reactions

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:09.400
people have studied for decades,
you get factors of 100 to 1,000

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.350
fold.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.810
Now, we need to get to a factor
of 10 to the 15 in some cases.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:17.620
We've already gotten to
the factor of 10 to 6.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.250
So obviously,
you're going to have

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:22.360
to use multiple combinations
of these mechanisms

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:27.130
to give you these tremendous
rate accelerations.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:33.290
So you will see over the course
of the rest of the semester

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.690
many active sites of enzymes
with many amino acid side

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:42.440
chains that are playing roles
in general acid and base

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.560
catalysis.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:52.015
And the last type of catalysis
is covalent catalysis.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.750
And again, covalent catalysis
means that you form--

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:05.200
and where have you already
seen covalent catalysis?

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.810
You've already seen this
when we talked about, how

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:10.145
do you study the structure
of the primary structure

00:59:10.145 --> 00:59:11.880
of a protein?

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.300
We use proteases with
tripsin or kimotripsan

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.220
that can break down the big
protein into small pieces.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.670
We went through the
mechanism of that reaction.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.570
In the active site
of that enzyme,

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:26.220
there is a serine that
forms a covalent bond.

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.900
So over the course
of the semester,

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.970
you're going to
see many examples.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:33.130
And I'll just put in
parentheses for those of you

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:38.360
who don't remember, go back
and look at serine proteases.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.660
This is a classic example
that's in every textbook.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.580
And how do we know how
much rate acceleration

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.490
you get from covalent
catalysis versus not having

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:49.560
covalent catalysis.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.010
We know this, again, because
of organic chemists studying

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:57.870
the detailed chemical
mechanisms of these reactions,

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.520
and we find out
that in this case,

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.890
we get rate accelerations
of 100 to 1,000 fold.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.930
So what you see is the enzymes.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:13.680
And these are the three
general mechanisms

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.280
by which all enzymes
catalyze their reactions

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.870
in some variation.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:24.150
Now, attributing out of
this 10 to 15, 10 to the 8

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.320
is associated with
this, and 10 squared

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.010
is associated with that
is extremely challenging.

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:30.900
And there are a lot
of people still trying

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:35.320
to dissect reaction
mechanisms in detail.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.070
And I would argue
that understanding

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:42.280
how these different methods
work and synergize to give you

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.820
these accelerations is a
key to eventually designing

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.660
new catalysts that
can do what you

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.710
want them to do that's
distinct from biological

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:54.220
transformations.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.074
And I think I'm probably over.

01:00:56.074 --> 01:00:57.490
I just want to say
one more thing.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.550
I just want to
give you a feeling

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.430
for what you have to do.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.110
If you're thinking about this
reaction coordinate, what

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:09.210
you need to do is think
about how would you

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:14.110
stabilize the transition state
relative to the ground state?

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.540
So what we're talking
about is stabilization

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.550
that's unique to the transition
state and not the ground state.

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.510
If you stabilized them
both, what would happen?

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:44.220
If you stabilized them both--
if you stabilize this guy

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.450
and you stabilize
this guy, the barrier

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.170
would be exactly the same.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.880
So what you need is some
way to uniquely stabilize

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.951
the transition state
over the ground state.

01:01:57.951 --> 01:01:59.700
So the question is,
how much do you think?

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.116
How much rate
acceleration do you

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:02.740
think you can get
from a hydrogen bond?

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.070
Does anybody have any idea?

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.490
One hydrogen bond.

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:10.470
So here, you have a protein
with 1,500 hydrogen bonds.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:14.160
But if you can get one
hydrogen bond that's

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.430
here in the transition
state of the reaction,

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.760
that's not over here, how
much rate acceleration

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.820
do you think you can get?

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.870
Anybody got any idea?

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.070
You can get almost 1,000 fold.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:32.265
I mean, and you can do a
very simple calculation.

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:37.320
I can't remember whether I have
this on the-- OK, so that's it.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.200
So we can do a very
simple calculation,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.840
and I'll use this to
show you the calculation.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.210
Here, we have our rate.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.280
This should be Delta G. The
dagger should be up in the air.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.590
So this is the
enzymatic reaction.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.050
This is the
[INAUDIBLE] equation.

01:02:56.050 --> 01:03:00.490
One has the same equation
for non-enzymatic reactions.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.240
So here's a
non-enzymatic reaction.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.670
In general, the
non-enzymatic reaction

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.260
can happen by some mechanism.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.560
To the enzymatic reaction
is just much, much slower.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.760
So if we assume, for example,
that the rate difference

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.820
between enzymatic and a
non-enzymatic reaction

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:22.860
is a factor of 10,
how much do you

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.810
get assuming that
all of these terms

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:29.950
are the same in the enzymatic
and the non-enzymatic reaction?

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:32.820
You can calculate a
Delta Delta G dagger

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.550
of 1.38 kilocalories per mole.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.740
For those of you
who are modern, this

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.760
is 5.8 kilojoules per mole.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.280
Sorry, I'm really
old, so I still

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.180
think in kilocalories per mole.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.110
But a hydrogen bond, one
hydrogen bond is worth 2 to 7--

01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:51.810
compared to no hydrogen
bond, is worth 2

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:53.980
to 7 kilocalories per mole.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:59.020
So a factor of 10 is 1.4
kilocalories per mole.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.290
So that shows you, then,
that if you had 2 to 7

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.150
with one hydrogen
bond, it can give you

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.180
these factors of 1,000.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.100
So I think that's an
observation that's

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.760
something you need to keep
in the back of your mind.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.160
Because you think about
it over and over again.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.340
It really doesn't take
much to align everything

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.940
in exactly the right way.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.930
And when I say hydrogen bond,
these hydrogen bond strengths

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.010
are really dependent on
how everything is aligned.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.200
If they're exactly aligned, then
you get much stronger bonds.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.950
They can even approach--
in the gas phase,

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:38.560
they could approach 30
kilocalories per mole.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.470
So having everything
aligned, that's

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:44.220
the job of this
whole big protein,

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.510
to actually give you catalysis.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.840
And I think I'm at the
end of my lecture now.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.610
I won't have time to talk
about-- I went over already

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:56.370
about the question
of specificity.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.590
But let me just say, I
think enzymes are really

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.620
quite amazing.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.090
There's nothing like them.

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.800
Faster than a speeding bullet.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.210
They can catalyze the rates
a million to 10 to the 12, 10

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.640
to the 15-fold.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.880
And they use really
the simple concepts

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.370
that chemists have
developed over the years.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:20.524
But the key to the enzyme
is this big huge molecule,

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:24.490
and the dynamics within this
molecule that gets everything

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:29.550
to align exactly right to be
able to lower these barriers so

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:32.850
that you can convert your
substrate into your product.

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:35.440
OK guys, see you next time.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.290
The end.

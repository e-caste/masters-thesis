00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:27.450
DAVID THORBURN: All right.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.400
Hello people.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.259
Welcome back to the
second week of our course.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.560
I'm happy to have this
wonderful live audience.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.090
But I also would
like very briefly

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750
to address our
video audience, who

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.680
will no doubt be watching
this long after I'm

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.359
dead on MIT's OpenCourseWare.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.150
So think of this as a
voice from the grave.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.117
You and the video
audience will sometimes

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.200
notice that as I'm lecturing
to this lively group,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.790
I will turn this
way and look up.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.195
You should realize that what I'm
turning toward and looking up

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:05.489
at is this projection screen,
which we will show you.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.470
And it sometimes has
this outline on it,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.550
which hopefully guides
us through each lecture

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.020
and sometimes has other
information and material on it.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.630
Sometimes it isn't
worth shifting over

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.960
to show the video
audience that image.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.475
But that's what I'm looking
at when I look so strange.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.260
I'd like to begin today
by taking a step back,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.830
by reminding you that
the order in which we're

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.090
watching the movies
in this course

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.890
is a little bit
arbitrary because I

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.900
wanted to use the feature
films as the defining date.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.440
And that's the
reason that we made

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.020
Keaton come first because The
General is an earlier film.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.710
It was almost a decade
earlier than Modern Times.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.210
But the truth is Chaplin
entered film before Keaton.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.260
And Keaton had
certain advantages

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.140
by the time he entered the
movies, in part because

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.930
of Chaplin's example,
although also

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.990
because of the fairly
complicated way

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.100
in which silent film had
already elaborated itself

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.470
after the first 10 years
or so of the 20th century.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.150
So I want to take a step
back into that early phase,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.550
just before Chaplain becomes
a filmmaker really in 1911,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.770
I think is when he joins
the Keystone Studios.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.290
Just to remind you of a story
that is told systematically

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.670
in David Cook's History
of Narrative Film,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.280
which is part of our required
reading in the course.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.750
And I hope you will
attend especially

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
to the details Cook offers about
those early years in Hollywood.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.080
If you read those
chapters from Cook

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.140
about the early
years of Hollywood

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
before Chaplin, the
movies before Chaplin,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.150
you'll recall that one of the
most fundamental things that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.170
happens before
Chaplin even appears

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.060
is the establishment
essentially of the industry I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.090
was describing last time.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690
The migration to the West
Coast is worth mentioning.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.650
Because movies, of
course, begin their career

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.030
in the United States
on the East Coast.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.320
Edison's first movie studio
was in East Orange, New Jersey.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.210
The Biograph Company
was originally

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.300
located on the East Coast.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.400
And almost all the
original earliest

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.250
films, even the earliest films
that were put into production

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.720
and shown commercially,
were made on the East Coast.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.910
Why did people move
to the West Coast?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.140
Why did Hollywood become
the sort of center

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.650
of the movie industry?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.540
What explains it?

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.490
It happens very early.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.520
One might think of it as
a very important moment

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.810
in the history of culture,
of popular culture,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.360
because for all the changes
that the movie industry has

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.860
undergone, Hollywood
remains the kind of center

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.570
of what is now a kind of global
enterprise of movie making.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.720
What helps to explain the
move to the West Coast?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.910
Nothing fancy.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.856
In the back, yes.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:00.980
AUDIENCE: Film year around.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.979
DAVID THORBURN: They could
film the year around.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.695
Why is that important,
especially in the early days?

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:07.320
AUDIENCE: You can
make movies whenever.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.260
You don't have to produce
them in the summer.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.960
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.270
You're not as dependent
on the weather.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.399
The Sun always
shines in California.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.630
If it's overcast,
you can still film.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.190
And there's no snow.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.660
There's virtually no rain.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.250
The weather is very conducive
to the making of film.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.620
And especially in
this early phase,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.150
when film stock was
relatively primitive compared

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.060
to the complexity
of film stock we

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.010
have-- today, the film
stock is so subtle

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.690
that you can film in the dark.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.070
You can film by fire light.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.900
Even amateur folks
owning camcorders

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.170
can film virtually in the dark.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.550
They can film by electric
light inside a room.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.705
Or tape, they can
videotape in that way.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:01.350
In the earliest
days of film, you

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.460
needed a tremendous amount
of light to expose the film.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.210
And what it meant that you
were dependent on the weather.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.557
So that was one major reason.

00:05:09.557 --> 00:05:11.640
But there's another one
that's even more important

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.820
in some ways, even though that
would seem a sufficient reason

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.526
for explaining why the migration
to the West Coast occurred.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.150
There's another even
more powerful one.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.900
It has to do with the
idea of patent warfare.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.210
Yes.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.210
What's your suggestion?

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.876
You don't have to
give the right answer.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:26.808
Give a--

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:28.210
AUDIENCE: Different types of
terrains fall into those--

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.410
DAVID THORBURN: Oh,
that's also true.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.909
Yes.

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.800
The environment of
Southern California

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.270
is particularly conducive to
a variety of film projects.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.430
There are mountains nearby.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.190
There's ocean nearby.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.990
There's desert nearby.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.560
And, of course,
that's also something

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.510
that makes it a uniquely
valuable environment.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.020
Maybe not a unique
environment, but a particularly

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.100
valuable environment.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.210
And that's a good answer.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.376
And you're right about that.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:52.570
But there's something else.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.680
And it has to do with conditions
in the East and Thomas Edison.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.600
Remember, Edison
in a certain way

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.410
wanted to lay claim to
virtually every invention

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.050
in the early part
of the 20th century.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.580
And he was primed to do so.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.150
He was already recognized
as a great genius,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.520
as the premier entrepreneurial
inventor of his era.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.920
And he immediately,
as he had done

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.550
with other projects
of his, began

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.980
to take out patents
to try to control

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.530
the use of movie technology.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.640
He wanted to become
the Edison monopoly.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.100
He was fantasizing that he would
control the movie-- whatever

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.030
the movie industry would
become, Edison's company

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.390
fantasized it was going
to take control of that.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.200
And, in fact, the Edison Company
hired law enforcement officers

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.830
and, according to
some historians,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.740
even in some places hired
goons, thugs, to go and break up

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.920
the sets and the shooting
of rival producers who were,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.190
according to Edison, infringing
on Edison copyrights.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.990
So the other reason-- another
reason for the move to the West

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.910
Coast was a lot of the
entrepreneurial movie makers

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.010
wanted to get free
of the patent police.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.140
They wanted to get out from
under the scrutiny of Edison

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.204
and his police.

00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:15.620
And by running to the West
Coast, they were able to do so.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.270
And, in fact, Edison was
unsuccessful in controlling

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.830
the technology, as Cook
and other historians

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.881
have made clear to us.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:26.130
So the move to the West Coast
is a very important one.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.140
And I will return to the
cultural, the historical,

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.460
and ideological or
intellectual implications

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.890
of that move to the West
Coast in a few lectures,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.070
maybe next week if I
get the opportunity.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.790
Because I want to
talk a little bit more

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.770
about what it meant
for American movies

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.200
that film was made on the
farthest western verge

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.530
of the society, away
from cultural centers,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.540
unlike the way in which
movies developed in Europe.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.350
And I'll talk about that
implication a bit later.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.320
Probably next week, when we talk
about the great German silent

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.030
film that concludes our
segment on silent films.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.490
So even before Chaplin enters,
the rudiments-- or more

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.880
than the rudiments, the basic
system of mass production,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.390
of studio-based
production, of manufacture

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.720
of the films in
one place and then

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.270
the distribution system that
developed in which theaters

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.830
essentially rented or purchased
films from the producers

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.140
was already in place.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.880
And, of course, the
two great figures here

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.191
is Thomas Ince-- and Cook
writes very well about Ince

00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:44.690
and his contribution
to the movies--

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.210
probably the person to whom we
could attribute the invention

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.910
of the movie studio, I suppose.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.940
And Mack Sennett, who
developed the Keystone Studios,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.360
out of which so many important
early comedies emerged

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.490
and the studio
which Chaplin joined

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.740
when he came to
the United States

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:12.590
to become a movie maker
in, I think, 1911 or 1912.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.780
So Ince and Mack
Sennett are important.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.530
And one might say one further
thing about this moment.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.180
As you know if you've
read Cook, Sennett

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.980
created what came to be
called the Keystone Studios.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.489
And Keystone Studios were
named, I think-- or maybe

00:09:28.489 --> 00:09:29.280
it was the reverse.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.791
I'm not sure-- was associated
with their prime product

00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:34.540
in the early days.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.270
And they were called the
Keystone Kops Komedies.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.730
We're going to show you a
fragment of those in a moment.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.440
They were frenzied action,
frenzied physical action.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.600
So this is the era.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.800
This is the moment, the
period in the first 10 years

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.910
of the movie industry
in the United States,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:59.140
when the basic system is being,
by trial and error, worked out.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.180
And by the time
Chaplin comes to join

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.350
the system after the
first decade or so

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.240
of the 20th century, the
system essentially is in place.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.180
There are already a number
of famous performers,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.650
both in comedy and in drama.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.970
There are emerging
certain particular studios

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.830
who have refined
the mass production

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.980
technique to produce their
movies on a regular basis.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.490
So an expanding
market for the movies

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.400
is being met by a systematic
manufacturing process

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.550
that Ince and Sennett
begin to work out

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.900
in systematic and
long-lasting ways.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.830
In ways that in a
certain sense continue

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.290
in residual form,
in vestigial form,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.820
to dominate the production
of movies even today.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.860
When we were talking about the
primitive and the simplicity

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.620
of early film, there was
one film I had on the stocks

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.417
we didn't have time
to show you last week.

00:10:57.417 --> 00:10:59.000
And I thought I would
show this to you

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.160
as a way of illustrating
again how relatively simple

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.064
the early films are.

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:04.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.505
See how influential
that first sneeze was.

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:12.590
The name of this film
is The Whole Dam Family.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.320
There's Mr. Dam.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.070
There Mrs. Helen Dam.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.992
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.395
There's their son, Jimmy Dam.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.150
The simplicity of
these movements

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.691
are part of what's
interesting to us.

00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:37.130
I mean this is still an era
in which people are just

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.100
fascinated by the idea
that movies capture movies.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.670
But what's the joke here?

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.995
The joke is embedded I suppose
in the title, The Whole Dam

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:47.495
Family.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.260
There's Miss.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.355
I.P. Dam.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.090
There's Baby Dam.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.060
What an actor.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:10.640
You see how it's framed
as if it's a painting, how

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.130
stationary the camera is.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.220
There's the Dam Cook.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.310
What's the joke here?

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.110
Finally, we're going
to come to the Dam Dog.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.060
What's going on here?

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.830
It's kind of risque.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.980
Remember, we're talking
about late Victorian,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.170
post-Victorian era.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.280
What's the joke here?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.864
It's the play on
the word "damn."

00:12:31.864 --> 00:12:33.280
It doesn't strike
you as shocking.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.810
But, in fact, if you said,
damn you in 1890 or in 1900

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.060
in certain quarters, people
stepped back and said,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.910
oh, my goodness.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.665
There's a kind of
semi-vulgarity there.

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:47.570
In other words,
it's not an accident

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.800
that this is not the Thorburn
family or the Smith family.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.890
It's significant that
it's the Dam family.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.390
Why?

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.620
Because they want
to make a joke.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.745
What's wrong with the joke?

00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:00.620
Why is it a stupid
joke for a movie?

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.870
Because it's not a visual joke.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.160
What does it depend on it?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.240
It depends on language.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.650
In other words, it's almost as
if the whole point of this film

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.150
depends on a joke that depends
not on anything that you

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.190
can experience
visually, but that

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.100
is resident in a verbal trick.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.130
And it's a trivial joke.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.380
It's not much of a joke, but
the film depends upon it.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.570
And it's evidence in a very
modest, but at the same time

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:33.280
dramatic and obvious way
of this process whereby

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.770
the new medium, this
new visual medium,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:40.190
has to emerge out of media, some
of which are not visual at all,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.900
but are verbal.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.880
And it's as if early filmmakers
haven't yet learned fully

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.240
how to exploit the qualities of
the medium they're working in.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.660
So it's a verbal joke,
rather than a visual joke.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.910
Much more powerful and
much more successful

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.480
were the Keystone Kops
Komedies themselves.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.270
And we have one example
of that to show you.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.790
I'm not sure that this is
a characteristic example.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.260
But it's close
enough to give you

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.030
as a sort of sense of what
the Keystone Komedies were

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.861
like before Chaplin
entered the game.

00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:16.304
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:16.304 --> 00:14:18.228
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.480
The essential joke
of the Keystone Kops

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.210
Komedies-- I don't even
know how many there were,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.210
perhaps hundreds.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.140
There were certainly
dozens and dozens.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.670
They were immensely
popular early short films.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.870
Some film scholars
have speculated

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.750
that one reason for
their popularity

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.250
was that they made
fun of policemen.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:51.410
That was an implicit sort
of mildly anarchic impulse

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.940
in these early comedies
because authority figures,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.900
people in uniform,
were being shown

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.210
to be clownish in some way.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.810
The primary element,
of course, is

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.910
to find ways to exploit
the movies' capacity

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.640
to show motion.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.830
And one reason I want you to see
this relatively crude example

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.090
is that there's a
certain sense in which

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.850
the short film that you saw
last week from Keaton, the film

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.220
Cops, is a sort of reprise of
this tradition of movie making.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.910
Although you can see how much
more coherent and character

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.970
oriented Keaton's
short film was,

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.760
but the way in which especially
the cops are mocked and shown

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.320
to be completely
clownish figures.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.620
Almost all of the Keystone
Kops Komedies to my knowledge,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.090
involved incompetent
policeman, who

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.350
engaged in mad active chases,
which often ended badly

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.570
for the policeman.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.090
Sometimes they would
end up all flying

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:06.223
into a river, or an ocean, or
some other natural disaster.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.450
And I think you can also
see-- that was actually

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.670
a very dramatic effect
for an early film.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.810
So there's an awful
lot about this

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.650
that would have
interested early--

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.980
seeing that car turn over,
some people in the audience

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.730
might never have seen
that in the movies before.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.240
And one could say that
these films in a certain way

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:41.450
anticipate a great deal of the
ridiculous action adventure

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.335
activity that we see
in films even today.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.060
But this is typical of those
early films, where they'll

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.640
make incredibly implausible
jokes just for the sake

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.950
of making the joke.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.490
And I'm not sure-- all
right, a Mack Sennett comedy.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.990
This is the kind
of comedy then that

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.130
was being made by the Sennett
Studio before Chaplain arrived.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.859
They were also certain
figures-- Fatty Arbuckle,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.610
the fat comedian who worked with
Buster Keaton, is an example.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:15.440
Who had already begun to
establish comic personae,

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.900
something like the persona that
Chaplin and Keaton created.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.480
So they were not the
first to do this.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.869
So there was a subtler
and already somewhat more

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.680
character-oriented
comedy beginning

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.920
to emerge before
Chaplin appears.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.120
But Chaplin's entry
into American movies

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.950
is also a turning point, a
fundamental turning point,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.080
as many scholars
have recognized.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.920
And it's a turning
point primarily

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.900
because what Chaplin
introduces-- I mean

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.390
introduces many, many
things to comedy.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.210
But he introduces one
thing especially-- well,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.520
two things especially.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.990
The first thing
that he introduces

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.070
is what we might call the
principal of the slow down.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.550
Instead of frenzied motion all
the time in Chaplin comedies,

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.094
there are moments of quiet.

00:18:02.094 --> 00:18:03.760
And in these moments
of quiet-- and this

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.930
is why they're important--
what begins to happen

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.850
is an attention is thrown away
from violent, frenzied physical

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.040
action toward character.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.455
What Chaplin
introduces into movies

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:19.060
is a somewhat more systematic
and serious interesting

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.520
character than had
ever occurred before.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.620
And what follows from
that introduction,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.670
from slowing down
the action, creating

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.940
moments of human interaction
in which the interest is

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.620
essentially psychological
and individual,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.030
rather than an interest simply
in frenzied motion and jokes,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.500
or frenzied motion
and suspense, which

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.520
is what you would get from a
Griffith melodrama, what you're

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.680
getting is-- so this
introduces several things.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.670
First of all, it introduces
a tonal variation.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.710
It means that in the
middle of comedies,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.500
there could be quiet,
serious moments.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.460
And, in fact, it becomes the
hallmark of Chaplin's comedy

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.480
that it really is
often not funny

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.920
or at least that it's
based on unfunny materials.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.280
And that there are poignant
and moving moments.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.130
It's as if Chaplin combines
comic and melodramatic

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.060
elements, especially
in his best work.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.340
I don't mean that when
he came into the films

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.550
he began to do this.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.500
In fact, he discovered
how to do this

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.420
in the course of his
career, about which I

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.790
will speak in a moment.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:21.230
So Chaplin brings a new
interest in character

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.690
and in psychological nuance.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:27.390
And, because of that
introduces tonal variation,

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.060
a complexity of tone.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.320
We think of the Tramp
figure as indelible

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.030
and unchanging in a certain way.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.440
His costume always the same,
his face always the same,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.040
the kinds of problems he
gets into always similar.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.420
And that's partly true.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:47.430
But the Tramp was not born fully
dressed in Chaplin's brain.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.650
He evolved the
Champ over a series

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.950
of short films in
the period from 1911

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.310
through about 1913 or '14.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.907
And one way I can
dramatize this for you

00:20:00.907 --> 00:20:03.240
is to show you how Charlie
looked in the very first film

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.882
he appeared in.

00:20:04.882 --> 00:20:06.340
He was not a director
in this film.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.520
He was just an actor.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.940
And he was a walk-on actor.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.500
He was not the star.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.460
The camera had an
immediate affinity for him.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.002
And after people
saw this film-- this

00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:15.376
is the first film
he appeared in.

00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:17.020
This is a still
from a film called

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.200
Kid Auto Races at Venice.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.790
It's a kind of documentary
about soapbox racing.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.750
And the Chaplain character had
just been hired by Mack Sennett

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.760
to join the Keystone Studios.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.540
And he made an
appearance in the film.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.100
He really didn't
have anything to do.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.309
But his appearance in the film
caused all kinds of interest

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:35.975
in the audience.

00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:38.100
The audience wanted to know
who that character was,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.590
why he was so interesting, and
what was interesting about him.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:46.290
You can see the beginnings
of the Tramp costume there,

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.820
but not the complete Tramp.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.060
Here's another early version
of Chaplin, wearing a long coat

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.020
and not looking very nice.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.590
Charlie is supposed to
be drunk in this picture.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.740
That's one reason
he looks nasty.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.990
It's in a film called
Mabel's Married Life.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.400
And he's actually
in conversation

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.410
with a dummy in this sequence.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.040
But you can see here that
the long coat violates

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.800
our idea of who the Tramp was.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:25.450
So it took awhile before the
Chaplain persona completely

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.950
emerged.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.210
And it was partly a
matter of trial and error,

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.440
although very quick
trial and error.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.460
I want to say a word
about Chaplin's career,

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.460
to give you a fuller sense of
how swiftly he became an icon

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.830
and how significant
his example is

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.650
for our understanding
of the power of movies.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:50.570
Chaplain's dates
are 1889 to 1977.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.360
He was born in England.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.090
And his early
childhood is actually

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.520
the stuff of
Dickensian melodrama,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.360
both terms I choose
with some intentionality

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:08.150
because there are parallels
between Charlie Chaplin's

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.030
early life and the
victimization that Dickens

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.680
dramatizes so powerfully in
many of his famous novels.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.570
And there are parallels
between Dickens' own childhood

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.300
and Chaplain's childhood.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
Dickens, the great
19th century novelist,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.160
who, like Chaplin, was
interested in victims,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.200
laid emphasis on the problems
of vulnerable people,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.090
of women, of children,
who wrote variations

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.960
on what we might call the
mortgage melodrama all

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.020
his career.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.730
His greatest works could be
said to be forms of melodrama.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.430
I'm talking about Charles
Dickens, the great 19th century

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.470
English novelist.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.240
And Chaplin grew up in an
environment that was steeped,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.100
not only in Dickens, but
in the traditions of stage

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.090
and novelistic
melodrama that permeated

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.220
European culture and especially
English culture of this time.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.060
But his life was a very
difficult one in some ways

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.770
as well.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.000
His father died
when he was eight.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.340
His mother was in and out of the
institutions all of her life.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.650
There were periods in Chaplin's
life, when he was just

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.610
a little child, when he was
literally completely abandoned.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.249
And he and his older brother
spent time living in doorways

00:23:18.249 --> 00:23:19.290
on the streets of London.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.120
He was literally a
homeless urchin as a child.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.110
He began to act on the
stage from the age of seven

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.190
and almost immediately
was recognized

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.530
as having astonishing gifts.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:37.070
He worked from 1906 through
1913 for a theatrical company

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.040
in England called the
Karno Company, K-A-R-N-O.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:46.300
And it was a company that put
on a certain kind of theatrical

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.780
anthology, in which
there would be skits,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.240
comic skits and serious
skits acted out.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.090
Sometimes when the
skits were over,

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.680
there would be song and
dance numbers, sometimes just

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.710
straight singing.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.360
A kind of British variety
show, influenced especially

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.660
by the traditions of
the British musical.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.040
And the Karno Company
was a traveling company.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.910
And first, Chaplain
worked with the company

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.680
all around the British Isles.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.330
And then, in I
think 1909 or 1910,

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.290
the Karno Company
made a triumphant tour

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.470
of the United States.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.880
By this time, Chaplin was one
of the leading actors in this.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.910
One of the great features of
the Karno Company performances

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.830
were pantomime performances.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.570
And Chaplin was a particularly
brilliant pantomimist.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.890
So he had a very
significant career.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.500
He was already a
successful performer

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.110
on the stage in
the Karno Company

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.360
and drew on traditions
of performance.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.630
Chaplin's father was
a popular singer.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.680
His songs were published
and he sang in the musicals

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.110
for a certain period.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.400
And Chaplin's mother
had visions or fantasies

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.370
of being a performer herself
and used to perform privately

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.090
to Charlie.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.860
So Charlie was steeped
in performance,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.880
steeped in theater.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.050
And as a young boy,
from the age of seven

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.220
on, was already sort
of acting on stage.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.080
Almost continuously after
the age of eight or nine,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.350
made his living as an actor.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.597
So as a relatively young
man, he made a trip

00:25:16.597 --> 00:25:18.430
to the United States
with the Karno Company.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.610
The Karno Company toured various
cities in the United States,

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.150
was a great success.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.360
A second tour almost
immediately followed,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.060
I think within six months.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.330
And on that second
tour, Mack Sennett

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.530
saw Chaplain perform
and hired him away

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.770
from the Karno Company.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.640
Saw that Chaplin had certain
gifts as a performer that

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.349
would work in the infant
medium of the movies

00:25:40.349 --> 00:25:41.140
and hired him away.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.140
And it was an inspired decision.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.540
When Chaplain first joined
the Keystone Studios in '19--

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.690
I think it's 1911.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.110
The date is in Cook.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.940
So be careful.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.900
My date may be a
year or two off.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.610
But around 1911, he
joins the Karno Company.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.950
His first few films, his
first three or four films,

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.470
he's just a performer in.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.200
But he has an immediate
affinity for the camera as well.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.170
And within half a
dozen films, he's

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.270
already beginning to
direct as well as to act.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:13.100
And within a
relatively short time,

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.450
he gets to be in
control of every aspect

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.650
of the making of his films.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.210
We can get some
sense of how richly

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.640
and symbiotically
the audience reacted

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.410
to the character of the
Tramp that Chaplin created

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:35.420
by talking in monetary
terms about the development

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.920
of his career, about the
progress of his career.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.400
He officially joined the
Keystone Company in 1914.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.430
He was hired in 1911 and 1912,
came over to the United States.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.350
And from 1914 and
1915, just that

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.980
one year, he worked for
the Keystone Company

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.250
and made 35 films in
that one-year period.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:02.570
He received what was then a
princely salary of $150 a week.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:07.670
The final films of those 35,
the last 15 or 20 or so of them,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.390
featured the Tramp
figure, who had now

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.200
been fully elaborated in
various adventures that

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.500
became characteristic of
Chaplin's vision of the Tramp.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.300
And they were
unbelievably popular,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.400
by far the most
popular shorts that

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.190
had ever been sent out of
any movie production company.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.320
And they made Chaplain
a household name,

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.680
first in the United
States, and then fairly

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.070
quickly all over the world.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.810
So successful were those early
films that in 1915 he was hired

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.700
away by another company, the
Essanay Company, E-S-S-A-N-A-Y.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.550
And for another year 1915, 1916,
he worked just for the Essanay

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.370
Company.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.270
But his salary went up
from $150 a week to $1,250

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.920
a week in one year.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.440
And that's a gigantic--
more than a thousand dollars

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.800
a week in 1915 is an
unbelievable fortune,

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.520
of course.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.900
He makes only 14
films in that period.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.820
So he goes from making
35 films in a year

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.720
to making only 14 films.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.860
And those 14 films are
more highly finished.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.190
He spends more time with them.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.820
We can see in this period,
we can see Chaplain learning.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.000
We can see Chaplin enacting in
small the Fred Ott principle.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.190
We could see Chaplin enacting
in small the principal

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.731
I talked about last
week, in which we

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:24.950
see him learning to develop
performance styles that

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.180
are appropriate to the camera,
appropriate to cinematic

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.420
experience, developing
techniques as a director

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:39.670
to emphasize certain aspects
of the Tramp's character,

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.070
experimenting with tonal
variation in his films,

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:49.660
experimenting with various kinds
of comic devices, some of which

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.310
he imports from his performances
with the Karno Company

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:58.932
and many of which he
refines and changes

00:28:58.932 --> 00:29:00.390
because he's working
in the movies.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.190
One famous example of this
migration from stage to screen

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.520
is a bit that Chaplain was
especially famous for when he

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.900
worked for the Karno Company.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.950
He did a bit them,
a pantomime, called

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.380
the Inebriate Swell,
the inebriated--

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.805
the drunk aristocrat.

00:29:18.805 --> 00:29:21.370
That's what a swell
is, a rich aristocrat,

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.810
a man about town, the
inebriated-- the drunken

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.612
aristocrat.

00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:28.320
And it was one of the
most popular pieces

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.380
that he performed on stage
for the Karno Company.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.970
He remade a version of
it, a very famous film.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.650
It's one of the very few short
Chaplins where Chaplin doesn't

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.180
play the Tramp, where he's
dressed up in a tuxedo

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.620
and he plays the
inebriated swell.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.800
And it's a film called One A.M.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.620
And in the entire film, Chaplin
plays a man who is drunk

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.190
and who keeps encountering
objects that misunderstands.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.794
So as an example, he comes
across a clothes tree

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:56.335
in his house.

00:29:56.335 --> 00:29:58.130
And instead of hanging
his clothes on it,

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.760
he embraces it as if it's
his wife, that sort of thing.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:07.860
And almost the entire
length of One A.M.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.210
has only one performer
in it, Chaplain himself.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.070
And he kind of
recreates and modifies

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.220
what he had done on stage
in that performance.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.240
It is in many ways a very
brilliant performance

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.950
and shows how imaginatively the
Chaplain character can interact

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.600
with objects, a theme to
which I'll return tonight

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.290
when I talk more systematically
about Modern Times

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.110
and about certain of
Chaplin's favorite strategies

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.800
for establishing character.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.030
So he works for the
Essanay Company.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.730
He makes 14 films,
including in 1915 a film

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.980
called The Tramp,
fragments of which

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.040
I'm going to show
you in a few minutes.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.170
Then he's so successful again.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.380
And the 14 films he makes
starring the Tramp become

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.740
international--
I don't know what

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.910
to call them-- international
phenomena, best sellers.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.750
And the Tramp becomes
the most sought after

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.570
and the most memorable
character in the movies.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.760
So he's hired away again by the
Mutual Company, one year later.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.270
And from 1916 to 1917, he
works for the Mutual Company,

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:21.500
in which he makes this time
$1 million for that year.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.310
And he makes only eight
films in that year.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.480
So he goes from $150 a week,
to $1,250 a week, to $1 million

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.525
a year within three years.

00:31:32.525 --> 00:31:36.220
And each move gives him
greater creative freedom,

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.600
gives him more autonomy.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.750
He begins to sort of
really refine his art.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.900
And we can see the process
happening in these shorts.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:50.220
In the films you're
going to see tonight,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.980
both of the short films,
Easy Street, 1917,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.640
and The Immigrant,
also made in 1917,

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.189
come from this Mutual period.

00:31:58.189 --> 00:32:00.230
And I mention this to you
because they're already

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.770
in some sense
sophisticated films,

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.610
even though they're not
feature-length films.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.240
And you can see that Chaplain
is bringing all the resources

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.490
of his narrative skills, of his
skills in creating character

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.530
to bear on those films.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.630
They're already in some
sense sophisticated works

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.270
of narrative.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.090
And there is an
apprentice period

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.760
that occurs earlier, which I
have just described to you.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.070
Finally, in his career,
he moves, in 1918,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:33.996
to a company called First
National, for which-- those

00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:35.870
are the people who pay
him a million dollars.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:36.370
I'm sorry.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.380
I made a mistake.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.266
His Mutual salary
was a mere $670,000.

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:42.890
He gets $1 million
when he goes to work

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:49.060
for First National in 1918, when
he makes, among other films,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.680
one of my favorite Chaplin
shorts, a film in which we

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.400
see the Tramp character playing
a GI in the first World War.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.310
It's called Shoulder Arms.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.060
And it's a characteristic
Chaplain short,

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.240
except that now what
Charlie is doing

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.490
is contending with
the Kaiser's army.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.130
He's fighting World War I.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.420
In earlier films, we'd seen
him fighting ice storms.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.120
We'd seen him fighting
against hunger.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.320
We'd see him literally
fighting in the boxing ring

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.940
in a film called The Champion.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.910
We'd seen him working as
an assistant to a pawn

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.240
broker in a film called
The Pawn Broker--

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.440
a whole series of jobs.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.260
And by the time we
get to 1918, it's

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.300
almost as if the Tramp has
held virtually every job you

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.660
could imagine.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.680
He can't hold a job for
long because he's a bum.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.810
He's a tramp.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.452
He's footloose.

00:33:34.452 --> 00:33:35.910
Again, a theme to
which I'll return

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.690
when we talk about Modern
Times this evening.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:42.830
And then finally,
in 1919, Chaplain

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.630
has become such a
gigantic figure,

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.500
such a international
icon, that he

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.550
joins with certain other icons,
D.W. Griffith, the greatest,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:55.580
most famous director
of the silent era;

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.430
and Mary Pickford and Douglas
Fairbanks, the two most

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.990
famous actors after
Chaplin in the silent era.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:07.430
The four of them get together
and they form United Artists.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.900
And they formed it in part
to create their own company

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.710
so that they would be able to
control their artistic output.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.540
And Chaplain, working for United
Artists, beginning in 1919,

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.639
Chaplain goes to work
on his feature films.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.630
And he makes the great film,
the great silent features,

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.650
that are at the heart
of his achievement.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:28.179
He makes The Gold Rush in
1925; a film called The Circus

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:32.000
in 1928, a more imperfect and
broken-back film in some way,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.440
but full of some of his most
imaginative comic performances;

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.770
one of his great films in
1931, called City Lights.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.310
And then finally, in
1936, the film you're

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.389
going to see tonight,
already deeply

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.100
into the sound era,
a film that remains

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.489
in some fundamental way a
silent film, Modern Times.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.530
Chaplin then goes on, after
the sound era is over,

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.470
to make a series of
movies in the sound era.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.070
And they all have some
modest interest for us

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.730
because they're Chaplain films.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.560
Some images from them that
remain very famous to this day.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.730
In fact, one of them was in
the New York Times today.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.500
Did any of you notice it?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.700
There was an article
about a scholar of globes,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.270
who had found
evidence for the idea

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.680
that a particular globe
in a German museum,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.640
which was said to have
been Hitler's globe,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.260
was not Hitler's globe.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.790
But in the middle
of the story, what

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:30.060
they-- any time a
person of a certain age

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.360
hears the word
"globe" and "Hitler,"

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.945
they think of Charlie's
film, The Great Dictator.

00:35:34.945 --> 00:35:35.570
You're smiling.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.070
Why?

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.180
Do you know the image?

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.265
Have you seen The
Great Dictator?

00:35:38.265 --> 00:35:39.181
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:41.736
DAVID THORBURN: What is the
image they're talking about?

00:35:41.736 --> 00:35:43.230
AUDIENCE: Playing with a globe.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.063
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:35:44.063 --> 00:35:45.630
There's a moment
in the film-- it's

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.540
a moment of great-- it's
not really a very good film.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.080
And Chaplain's sound films are
mostly of historical interest,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.160
despite what some
Chaplain buffs would say.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.310
His great work is--
he's a silent artist.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.179
And the sound film
caused problems for him

00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:01.720
that he couldn't
fully adjustable to.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.210
But every one of his
sound films has interest

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.006
and has brilliant moments.

00:36:06.006 --> 00:36:07.380
And the one you're
remembering is

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.890
one of the most remarkable and
astonishing symbolic moments

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.060
in Chaplin's work.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.090
Yeah.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.650
It's an incredibly
ambitious film.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.760
It tells us how ambitious
a figure Chaplin

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.380
was because he makes a satire
of Hitler and Mussolini

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.790
in an era when Hitler
and Mussolini are not yet

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.180
recognized for the egregious,
monstrous, evil figures

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.760
that we know them to have been.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.020
They were taken seriously.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.965
They had been voted into office.

00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:34.590
Millions and millions
of people thought

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.140
they were admirable leaders.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.770
So when Chaplain made
The Great Dictator

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.644
in '19-- what- '40
or '41, he was doing

00:36:42.644 --> 00:36:43.810
something incredibly daring.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.490
And he was actually
showing that he

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.110
thought the movies were an
art form capable of taking

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.364
on the largest
political subjects.

00:36:51.364 --> 00:36:53.280
So even though there are
problems in the film,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.830
and it's not an
absolutely great film,

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.050
not memorable artistically
in its own way,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.000
there are moments in
it that are remarkable.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.250
And it's also a
significant document

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.460
because it reminds us
of Chaplin's ambitions

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.430
as an artist.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.420
Chaplin was one of the
very first filmmakers,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.530
along with D.W.
Griffith I suppose,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:16.950
to realize that the movies
had an aesthetic possibility,

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.827
latent aesthetic energies
and powers that if they were

00:37:21.827 --> 00:37:23.660
tapped, would make the
movies the equivalent

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.264
of traditional art forms,
like theater and the novel.

00:37:26.264 --> 00:37:27.930
And, of course, he
was right about that.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.640
And he even made some films
that achieved that level

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.070
of seriousness and resonance.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.730
The moment that
you're remembering,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:35.592
what happens in it?

00:37:35.592 --> 00:37:37.300
AUDIENCE: He's like
dancing with a globe.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.590
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.990
It's a moment of sort of manic
glee, in which the Hitler

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.880
character, played by Charlie
Chaplin, takes a globe out

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.290
and it's like a balloon.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.960
And he pops it up and down.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.340
And we see him throwing it up
and kicking it with his hat,

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.280
like that.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.380
And it's a kind of fantasy
of world domination.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.390
And it's supposed to show what a
ridiculous and infantile figure

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.830
this mock Hitler is.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.439
And it is the most memorable
image from that film.

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:06.230
So in this article,
that really had nothing

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.896
to do with Chaplain,
there was a picture

00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:10.700
of Charlie playing Hitler,
kicking the balloon

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.350
up and down.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.300
And one reason that I
think it's significant,

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.610
that it's a mark of Chaplin's
greatness as an artist,

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.350
that even in his
imperfect texts,

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:24.170
even in the films that really
do not belong to the category,

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.680
to the most important
category of his most

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.590
lasting and valuable art,
images from those works

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.350
are still part of our
common cultural inheritance.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.320
He's a very great artist,
the first great artist

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.180
of the movies.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:45.100
And a figure who's
imaginative creations

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.020
remain vital and
alive today in a way

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:54.680
that very few artists
from that era remain,

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.370
similarly accessible
and important to people.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:01.640
And it's a mark of the reach
of Chaplin's imagination

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.490
that this is so, of his
importance as a figure.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.144
Well, there's much
more one could

00:39:08.144 --> 00:39:09.810
say about the development
of his career.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.760
But I want to cut
this short because I

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.050
want to show you the moment--
I don't mean that there's only

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.880
a single moment.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.170
But I want to show you fragments
from the film in which we can

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:25.370
see Chaplin really discovering
certain aspects of what

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.050
he wants to do and also where
we can see Chaplin screwing up.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.400
We can see Chaplin at a
stage before he becomes

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.270
the self-confident,
totally autonomous artist

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.560
he becomes relatively soon.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.320
Can we put up fragments from
The Champ-- from the Tramp?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.414
This is a film appropriately
called The Tramp.

00:39:46.414 --> 00:39:47.080
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:47.705
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:47.705 --> 00:39:50.240
And it's a fairly
characteristic Chaplin film.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.050
But I think it's the film in
which, among other things,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:58.110
Chaplin discovers that he can
marry melodrama and comedy.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.950
It's the film in
which he discovers

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.730
that he can do effects that
are pathetic, and poignant,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.890
and sentimental and mix
them with comedy in ways

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.050
that are interesting.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.472
So here's a scene where
Charlie is rescuing a damsel.

00:40:11.472 --> 00:40:13.380
And he does it in a
kind of comic way.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.900
He's a kind of bum himself.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.960
But he's always a kind
of chivalric figure.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.730
Can you jump ahead?

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:25.310
Let's just show
the next one, Greg.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.070
I'm just going to show
you a bad moment here.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.420
He rescues this girl.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.490
She turns out to be the
daughter of a farmer.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:40.260
He's then hired by the
farmer in gratitude.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.416
And then we get this bit.

00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:44.290
And I'm showing you this
bit partly because I

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.190
want you see that it isn't
really all that funny

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.898
or that it's just kind
of easy slapstick.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.585
I don't mean that
it's without interest.

00:41:11.585 --> 00:41:13.315
It obviously has some interest.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.350
But this incompetence is
inconsistent in some respects

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:30.170
with the coherent character that
he's going to begin to create.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:31.560
It's never that
the Tramp becomes

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.870
this fully competent character.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.530
But this kind of joke
here, look at this.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.790
That's his foolish joke.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.380
That trivializes him in a way.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.270
Can you think of examples
of that in Keaton?

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.300
Remember in Cops, where, for
example, when he's riding along

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.580
in his car, he devises
that mechanism that

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.030
ends up punching the cop.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.890
That would be an example
of a kind of-- it's a joke.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:57.740
But it sort of violates
the spirit of the movie.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.530
It seems a piece of debris that
is forced into the film, that

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:05.620
may have a comic moment, but
makes the film less coherent.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.847
That kind of thing is
characteristic of the Tramp.

00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:09.680
A bit later in The
Tramp-- I don't have time

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.910
to show you this passage--
a bit later in The Tramp,

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.530
we see Charlie confronting
the woman that he had rescued

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.370
and discovering for
the first time--

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.613
is it a long sequence, Greg?

00:42:19.613 --> 00:42:20.112
GREG: No.

00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:21.320
It's only a half minute.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.028
DAVID THORBURN: Well,
put it up while I'm

00:42:23.028 --> 00:42:24.970
talking, if you can find it.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.760
You can see in this
sequence, which

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.465
I'll let run behind me, while
you pay attention to my words--

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.460
--and while the camera looks at
it and then comes back to me.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.550
What you can see
happening in this sequence

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.760
is Chaplin discovering how
he can be, not just comical,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.950
but sentimental.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.910
How he can elicit sympathy
from his audience,

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.810
create sentimental effects.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.710
In other words, what Charlie has
just done here in this image is

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.210
he's meeting the
girl's boyfriend.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.876
He didn't know the
girl had a boyfriend.

00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:54.530
He was falling in love with her.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.299
Watch his expression here.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.220
You see, he's very upset
by what he's learned.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.054
In other words, this
is not a funny moment.

00:43:06.054 --> 00:43:08.512
And this is the moment, I think,
in Chaplin's career, where

00:43:08.512 --> 00:43:12.160
he realizes the films he's going
to make should not be thought

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.490
of as simply comedies at
all, but as something more

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.060
complicated than that,
as comedies with heart,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.470
as comedies devoted
to character,

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:23.150
as comedies that are interested
in human interactions.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.730
And that discovery tremendously
enlarged movie comedy,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.640
tremendously enlarged the
movies more generally.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.635
And then we can see Charlie
saying-- Charlie says goodbye.

00:43:34.635 --> 00:43:38.190
And he writes this little sad
message and he leaves her.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.430
So it's the moment
when pathos, sentiment,

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.070
enters Chaplin's work.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.570
And in the films
you'll see tonight,

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.240
you'll understand why, after
he made this discovery,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.250
he began to meld these
two elements more and more

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.660
fully together.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.450
So this is a way of reinforcing
what I called last week,

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.150
the multiplicity principal.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.860
What we can see is that in
those jokes with the pitchfork,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.120
there was no multiplicity.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.911
They were just funny
because Charlie didn't

00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:05.570
know how to use the pitchfork.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.440
But later moments in this
film, and in many later films,

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.050
we see Chaplain beginning
to create effects which

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:16.220
have more than one consequence,
more than one significance

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.280
for the audience.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.380
One of the most remarkable
things about the chase scenes

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.690
that Charlie Chaplin
develops and begins

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.290
to perform in his
films-- and you'll

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.380
see wonderful examples
of them tonight--

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.340
is that the chase
scenes themselves

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.547
are tremendously moving.

00:44:30.547 --> 00:44:31.755
They're tremendously comical.

00:44:35.234 --> 00:44:36.900
They're full of comic
bits that are just

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.250
as imaginative as any comic
sequence one could ask for.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.400
But they do something else,
in addition to amuse us.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.120
They declare for
Charlie's character.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.240
When Charlie runs
away from someone,

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.990
what we can see him doing
is using his intelligence,

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:56.470
using his improvisatory capacity
to figure out how to get away.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.750
So that even when
he's running, he

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.630
is also expressing his nature.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.550
And when the audience sees
the imaginative, or clever,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.670
or daring way in which
he makes his escape

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.850
in a particular chase
sequence, they're not just

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.710
being amused by a joke.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.780
They are also understanding
his character in a deep way.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.930
He's defining his character,
even as he's also amusing us.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.550
So we can feel the multiplicity
of that, the density,

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:23.090
the texture of that, always a
mark of superior entertainment,

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:26.220
always a mark, I would
say, of art itself.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.030
Well, one way to
clarify some of this,

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.660
and especially to
clarify Chaplin's

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:36.450
remarkable popularity, is to
talk about the Tramp as a myth,

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.660
as a mythic figure.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.440
And if you think
about his costume,

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.720
you'll understand
partly what I mean.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.440
He wears a coat and
vest that are too tight

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.340
and pants and shoes
that are too big.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.350
So the principle of
mismatch or of ambiguity

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.970
is built into his costume.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.920
And then he carries
this cane and this hat.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.600
Now, he shows a
kind of elegance.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.330
But it's a kind of shabby,
down-market elegance.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.115
But the question is, is
Charlie downwardly mobile?

00:46:05.115 --> 00:46:07.260
Is he an aristocrat who's
fallen on hard times?

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.210
Or is he a poor person, who
has put on airs and aspires

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.620
to the world of tuxedos
and fancy clothes?

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.280
This question is never answered.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.260
And that ambiguity
in his character

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.270
may be part of why the audience
is able to identify with him.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.170
There's an uncertainty
about where

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:28.590
he belongs, a kind of
mismatch or an ambiguity

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.920
inherent in his costume.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.790
His body itself is a source
of his mythological status.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.060
It's small, dexterous,
energetic, incredibly graceful.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.870
He's one of the great
acrobats and physical dancers,

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.595
physical performers,
that you'll ever see.

00:46:44.595 --> 00:46:46.490
And in the films
you'll see tonight,

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.740
you'll see many examples
of this, including examples

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.770
of Chaplain on skates,
of Chaplain doing

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:58.640
the equivalent of dances,
and of his dexterousness

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:06.030
in situations involving running
or escape, just as powerfully

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.130
as anyone.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.580
We'll see
dramatizations of this,

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.560
just as powerful as anyone could
ever imagine, ever hope for.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.510
And then his face.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.380
So his costume, his
body, and then his face

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.750
are part of the myth as well.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.750
He has an unbelievably
expressive face.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.370
His face is a theater in itself.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.010
And it was Chaplain, more
than any other early director,

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.410
who explored the
implications of the closeup.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.020
And I'll show you
some examples tonight

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.350
of the way in which
Chaplin manages

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:39.190
to use the closeup in silent
film for incredibly-- to do so.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.870
And to be, at the
same time, what

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.830
we might call deeply,
incredibly eloquent,

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:47.370
a silence that is eloquent
because of the qualities

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.390
in his face.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.360
And the moral
qualities of the Tramp

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.330
are also appropriately
ambiguous.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.510
He has chivalric qualities.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.820
He wants to defend children
and vulnerable women.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.850
He's always a kind of
defender of the weak.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.160
But at the same time, he's
an opportunist and also

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160
a survivor.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.290
And these qualities don't
fit perfectly together.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.600
And we see both elements
in the Tramp character,

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.310
again and again.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.890
Again, tonight, in The
Immigrant especially,

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.840
you'll see both sides of
the Chaplain character,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:23.910
both his opportunistic side
and also his chivalric side.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.160
So these qualities
created a kind

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.890
of mythic aura, a mythic
authority for Chaplin.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.840
And there's one other thing
that contributed to the myth.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.210
It was that there's a historical
reality to the hobo figure.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:38.090
Long before Charlie
Chaplin began

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:41.930
to perform as a kind of
tramp figure in the movies,

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:44.260
they were real tramps
in the society.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:51.590
And the existence of a genuine
population of homeless people--

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:56.570
they often rode
the rails, and they

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:01.520
were present actors in
most large and small cities

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.640
in the country.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.230
The fact was there was a
population of homeless people

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:08.990
that the Tramp figure alluded
to and reminded the audience of.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:13.160
And that also helped to
strengthen his mystic power

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.880
because it was as if the
audience was recognizing

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.250
that in some sense Charlie
was a kind of embodiment

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.650
or a symbol of this
social actuality.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:29.070
So he had a kind of mythic
power that communicated itself

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:29.900
to his audience.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.090
And it meant that every
repetition of a Tramp film,

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.630
which might very well go
through the same motions,

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.110
but put the Tramp in a
slightly different environment

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.830
or a slightly
different job, would

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.400
be pleasing to the audience,
some principle of repetition

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.240
and variation.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.796
Well, finally, the
paradox of Chaplin's work.

00:49:47.796 --> 00:49:49.920
And the paradox I want you
to think about tonight--

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.860
and we'll end with this
point-- is that Chaplin's world

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.511
is full of comedy.

00:49:55.511 --> 00:49:57.510
It's a comedian's world,
although it's more than

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.250
just comic, as I've suggested.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.320
But the irony of
Chaplin's world is

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.120
that the comedy is so
fundamentally based on things

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.270
that are so deeply unfunny.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.710
Chaplin's the most deeply social
and in some ways even political

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.040
of directors.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.830
And I'll discuss this
aspect of his work

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.260
tonight, when we talk
about Modern Times and some

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.120
of his other films.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.790
But the crucial point here
is that Chaplain's world

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:22.250
is a world of elemental themes.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.300
Virtually every
single Chaplin movie

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:29.570
is about hunger, aggression,
victimization, confinement.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:33.710
I mean the subject matter
of Chaplin's comedy

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.430
is the furthest from comedy.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:37.370
And part of his
genius, part of what

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.170
makes him such a remarkable
and important artist,

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.880
is that this immensely
unpromising material,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.800
this disturbing and in many
ways frightening material,

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.230
dramatized sometimes with full
frightening effect-- Chaplin

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.930
often, because of
his diminutiveness,

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.120
puts himself up against
large figures, giant figures,

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.720
to emphasize his
vulnerability and smallness.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.280
Again and again, the
substance of Chaplin's comedy

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.060
is the substance of
victimization, aggression,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.940
misery, inequality, inequity.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.570
In other words, the subject
matter of Chaplin's work

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.210
is the furthest from comedy.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:20.200
And yet he makes enduring
comedy, enduring melodrama, out

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.720
of those unpromising materials.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.620
That paradox about
Chaplin's world

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.040
is at the heart of his work.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.180
And it's at the heart of
why, of all silent directors,

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.950
his very best films
remain interesting today

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.090
intrinsically, not just because
they're wonderfully interesting

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.140
artifacts.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:43.917
But intrinsically because they
remain serious, valuable films.

00:51:43.917 --> 00:51:45.500
All of the Chaplain
films you're going

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.350
to see tonight, the two
shorts and Modern Times,

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:51.315
fit that description, as
I hope you will agree.

00:51:51.315 --> 00:51:53.440
See you this evening.

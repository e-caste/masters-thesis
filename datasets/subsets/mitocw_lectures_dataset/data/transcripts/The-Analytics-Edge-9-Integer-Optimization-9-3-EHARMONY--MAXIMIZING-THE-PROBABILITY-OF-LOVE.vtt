00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.170
In this lecture,
we'll discuss how

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.050
analytics and, in
particular, optimization

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.920
is used in online dating.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.890
Specifically, we'll discuss the
story of the company eHarmony

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.970
that uses optimization
to maximize

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.430
the probability of
a successful match

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.030
between compatible adults.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.350
The goal of eHarmony is to
take a scientific approach

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.390
to love and marriage and
offer it to the masses

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.110
through an online
dating website focused

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.760
on long term relationships.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.950
Indicators of
success for eHarmony

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.560
include the fact that nearly
4% of U.S. marriages in 2012

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.840
are a result of eHarmony.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.740
Furthermore, the company
has generated, by 2009,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.460
over $1 billion in revenue.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.650
How is eHarmony different?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.640
Unlike other online
dating websites,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.610
eHarmony does not have users
browse other users' profiles.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.970
Instead, eHarmony uses
a compatibility score

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.460
between two people and uses
optimization algorithms

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850
to determine the
user's best matches.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.560
How does eHarmony compute
the compatibility score?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.820
The score is based on
29 different dimensions

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.460
of personality including
character, emotions, values,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.620
traits, etc.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.340
The calculation involves
a 436 questionnaire.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.539
The matches must
meet at least 25

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.580
out of 29 compatibility areas.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.680
The graph from eHarmony's
website shown in this slide

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.890
describes one such question
regarding character.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.210
Let us discuss the
history of the company.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.230
The founder of the company
is Dr. Neil Clark Warren,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.400
a clinical psychologist who
counseled couples and began

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.650
to see that many marriages
ended in divorce because couples

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.160
were not initially compatible.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.560
Warren has written many
relationship books.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.780
Finding the Love of your
Life, The Triumphant Marriage,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.790
Learning to Live with the Love
of Your Life and Loving It,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.610
Finding Commitment,
and many others.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.310
In the late 1990s,
after more than 35 years

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.230
of work as a clinical
psychologist and marriage

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.660
counselor, Warren decided
to test his theory

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.320
that certain characteristics can
predict compatibility and lead

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.890
to more satisfying
relationships.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.079
After three years
of research Warren

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.570
developed a model
of compatibility

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.010
that is now the basis of the
company's matching system.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.220
The service launched its
matching service for singles

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.500
in 2000.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.150
Since then, the company has
had about 33 million members,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.010
and as of 2008,
about 15,000 people

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.210
take the eHarmony
questionnaire each day.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.960
Interested users may fill
out the compatibility quiz,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.340
but in order to
see matches members

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.170
must pay a membership
fee to eHarmony.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.050
What is a distinguishing
characteristic of eHarmony?

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.800
While eHarmony was not the
first online dating website

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.880
and faced serious
competition, there

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.079
is a key difference from
other dating websites.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.550
eHarmony takes a quantitative
optimization approach

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.650
to matchmaking
rather than letting

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.280
users browse their website.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.110
In this lecture,
we'll explore some

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.400
of the analytics eHarmony uses.

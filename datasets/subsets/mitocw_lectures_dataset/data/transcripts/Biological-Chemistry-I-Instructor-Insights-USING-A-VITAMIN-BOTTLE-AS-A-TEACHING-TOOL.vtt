JOANNE STUBBE: If you look
at the vitamin bottle,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.210
you have all these vitamins
you eat, like, what

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.980
do they call them?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.770
Biotin, riboflavin, pyridoxal.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.240
So all of those small, organic
molecules, and they all

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.990
have chemical reactivity and
they interact with the protein

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.320
and allow the protein to do
chemistry that can't normally

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.460
be carried out by just the amino
acid side chains of the protein

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.220
in the active site
of the enzyme.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.790
So the vitamins you
eat are not actually

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.770
what's interacting
with the protein,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.840
they need to be modified.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.360
So they are the
precursors to what

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.060
are called co-factors
that, again,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.810
expand the repertoire of what's
found in enzymatic systems.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.590
So you have a whole bunch
of organic co-factors

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.120
that actually can be
made spontaneously.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.180
If you throw in some simple
molecules like cyanide

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.130
and stuff, these things
all self-assemble,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.700
so they're all from
the primordial soup.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.230
And in fact, many
of these vitamins

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.890
can do chemistry without
any enzyme at all.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.110
But they can't do
it specifically.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.290
And they can't do it rapidly.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.360
So we have all these
organic molecules

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.640
that can self-assemble
that expand the repertoire,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.790
but if you look at a vitamin
bottle, you will see minerals.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.240
And that's one thing that I
think most biochemistry courses

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.430
don't talk about, is metals.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.960
And it's now proposed
that between 35% and 50%

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.290
of all the proteins in
our body have metals that

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.330
are essential for function.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.440
And so these minerals that you
eat, iron or zinc or calcium,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.340
all play a central role,
again, in expanding.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.230
They all help in many
cases facilitate chemical

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.160
transformations,
and in the way we

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.880
can understand by understanding
basic chemical principles.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.090
So the vitamin
bottle, we come back

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.660
to over and over again through
the course of the semester,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.400
because all the enzymes
in metabolic pathways

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.880
have different kinds of
co-factors that are required

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.871
to make the enzymes function.

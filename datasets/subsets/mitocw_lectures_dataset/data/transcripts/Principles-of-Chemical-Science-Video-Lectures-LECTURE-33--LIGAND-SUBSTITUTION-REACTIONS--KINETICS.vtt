00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
-- dissolved in water,
such that there are six water

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
molecules arranged around the
metal in an octahedral array.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You will see here that I have
colored one of the water

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
molecule's oxygens in this peach
color because we are going to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
talk about reactions today.
In fact, I am going to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
introduce you to the idea of a
potential energy surface for a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
reaction.
I am taking water substitution

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as an example and as a context
for this, but this very general.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the same ideas that we are
going to be talking about today

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
would apply to reactions in
organic chemistry or in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
biochemistry.
Let's imagine having this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
system dissolved in liquid
water.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And let's further imagine that
we have some way,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
perhaps, for isotopic labeling
of the oxygens in the water to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
differentiate from those that
start out on the metal complex.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so I am differentiating
here by using a green color for

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the oxygen in a liquid water
solvent.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And in this reaction,
it is a very simple reaction in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
which liquid water from
solution, --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
-- we are going to talk about
reaction mechanisms today,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
somehow will come in and bind
to the metal center and displace

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
one water molecule from the
metal center.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I will represent that here
by saying that we would lose

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that one water molecule that
I've colored this way.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And that gives us our product,
which is very similar to the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
starting material in this case,
--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
-- except that one water
molecule, the one here colored

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
green, has replaced one of the
others.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And when we look at this type
of reaction as a function of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which 3d transition element we
have at the center of the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
octahedron, we find that the
time constant for this reaction

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
taking place varies quite
dramatically.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And this is informative with
respect both to the mechanism of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the reaction,
as we will discuss,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and to the electronic structure
attributes of the systems that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
control the way a metal binds to
its ligands.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And so, for example,
let's make a little table of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the metal n plus.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And we will take the log of the
rate constant for the reaction,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which I will denote with this
k.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Small k is going to be our rate
constant.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And the units that we would
find for such a rate constant

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
would be reciprocal seconds to
describe how fast this takes

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
place.
And, if we start down here at

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
chromium three plus,
we would find that the log of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the rate constant is
approximately minus 6.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And then, if we went to
vanadium two plus,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the rate constant log goes to
minus 2.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So the reaction is faster than
it is for chromium three.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And then, if we look at some of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the other d ions that are
possible here,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
we could have chromium two plus
or copper two plus.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And, for both of those,

00:04:08.082 --> 00:00:09.000
the log of the rate constant is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You can see,
because I am taking the log of

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
these first order rate
constants, the actual rates of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
these processes differ here by
15 orders of magnitude.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That is an enormous difference.
So it is not true that whatever

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
metal ion you have at the
center, the rate at which water

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
comes on and off and it
exchanges with water from

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
solution is about the same.
It is not.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It differs over an enormous
range of actual rates,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
many orders of magnitude,
depending on exactly which

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
metal ion you have here.
And so I will classify these as

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
either slow or fast.
And we will say that here,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we are slow.
And here we are fast.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And, of course,
there are cases that are

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
somewhat in between.
But I will be giving you a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
little bit of nomenclature that
arises from the study of such

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
ligand substitution rates in a
little while.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Here is one type of
substitution reaction.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Now, I would like you to
consider a different type of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
substitution reaction,
one that does not have a

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
product that is essentially
identical to the starting

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
material.
And that will be one as shown

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
here.
Let's use the metal tungsten at

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the bottom of Group 6,
a 5d transition element.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This makes a very stable binary
compound with carbon monoxide in

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
which six carbon monoxide
ligands bind to the metal center

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
at the corners of an octahedron.
And in this tungsten

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
hexacarbonyl system,
you are going to find that,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
as you will be seeing in
recitation this week,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
these CO ligands are pi-acids,
they are very high in the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
spectrochemical series.
This leads to a molecule like

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
this being colorless.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It has a large delta O.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And because ligands are
pi-acidic and the metal center,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
as you will see,
this metal center is a d six

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
pi-base,
the metal itself is very

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
electronically complimentary to
its set of six carbon monoxide

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
ligands.
So a system like this is very

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
stable.
And what you might like to do

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is to tag some biomolecule with
a tungsten pentacarbonyl

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
fragment, so that you could use
the vibrational spectroscopy

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
associated with these CO
oscillators to watch some

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
biological process that has that
thing attached to it.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And one example of a
substitution reaction you might

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
wish to use would be the one
shown here.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
This ligand that I am currently
sketching is one in which we

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have a phosphorus with a lone
pair and three phenyl groups

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
attached to it.
A phenyl group is a benzene

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
ring where one of the positions
is substituted.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This ligand here,
then, is triphenylphosphine,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and this is a good ligand for
various types of metals.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And, in fact,
one of the Nobel laureates that

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I may have mentioned in passing
this semester,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Sir Jeffrey Wilkinson,
used triphenylphosphine as a

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
ligand in the preparation of
what is now universally known as

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Wilkinson's hydrogenation
catalyst.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So this ligand is quite common,
indeed, and well-known.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And what we might like to do is
to replace one carbon monoxide

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
with this triphenylphosphine
ligand.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That would be a simple
substitution reaction.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We would like one equivalent of
carbon monoxide to be evolved as

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
CO gas in this reaction.
But we find that we can put

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
tungsten hexacarbonyl in the
presence of triphenylphosphine,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and nothing really happens.
They just sit there and look at

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
each other.
They do not react.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So one of the things that
happens when you are learning to

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
do synthetic chemistry is that
the outcome of a reaction can be

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
either that it proceeded cleanly
onto products.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And one possible outcome is
there was no reaction at all.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And so this is what we will
call no thermal reaction.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And that means that just with
the energy supplied by the

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
temperature of the room,
the reaction is not proceeding

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
in the forward direction.
And what that may mean is that

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
there is an energy barrier to
this reaction.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And energy barriers are going
to be a topic of this lecture in

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
a few moments,
but there may be an energy

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
barrier.
And we don't have sufficient

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
energy to surmount the barrier,
so the substitution reaction is

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
not taking place.
But we find that if we shine

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
light on the system,
UV light, then the reaction

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
takes place.
And we form this desired

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
product that has one of the
carbon monoxide ligands replaced

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
with triphenylphosphine.
That would be the initial

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
product formed in such a
process.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Still octahedral,
now five CO ligands instead of

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
six, and one of them replaced by
triphenylphosphine.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And it occurs under the action
of UV light.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
If you put a photon into the
system for some reason,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
we can now surmount the energy
barrier to the reaction,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
blow one of the CO molecules
away as CO gas.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We might, in fact,
in practice,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
possibly be bubbling an inert
gas like N two through

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the solution to sweep the
evolved carbon monoxide out of

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the system to help the reaction
go to completion as we are

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
carrying out such a prep.
But, in any event,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the key feature is that it goes
under photolysis in the presence

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
of a UV lamp but not simply
through input of normal thermal

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
energy.
And, in thinking back to the

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
development of the electronic
structure of systems of this

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
type, we can actually begin to
understand this.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Because we have an energy
diagram, a d orbital splitting

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
diagram for simplicity,
where we have our t(2g) set and

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
our e(g)*.
And tungsten is in Group 6,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
the ligands are all neutral,
so this is d six.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This is a common electron count
for octahedral systems that are

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
quite stable.
And CO is high in the

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
spectrochemical series,
so it leads to a large value of

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
delta O.
This splitting here between

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
t(2g) and e(g) is large.
And that means we have an s

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
equals zero state,
with the system not being

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
paramagnetic,
all the electrons paired up in

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
t(2g) and this big gap.
And what happens when we add a

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
photon to the system,
we can promote the system into

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
an excited state.
And, in order to satisfy the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
spin selection rule,
this excited state will have no

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
net spin polarization.
This one is s equals zero,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
this one is s equals zero to
satisfy the spin selection rule

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that we have talked about.
But notice, now,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
in the excited state --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
-- we have an electron in e g
star.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And, as I was discussing last
time, when you look at the MO

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
theory for a problem like this,
e(g)* is sigma antibonding with

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
respect to the ligands.
I am going to illuminate that

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for you very clearly in a few
moments with a graphic,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but this is sigma star with
respect to the ligands.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So what are we doing?
We are taking an electron,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
here, that is pi bonding
because CO is a pi-acid ligand.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In the ground state,
this electron that we are going

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to promote is helping to bind
the carbon monoxide ligands to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the metal.
And then, when we input that

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
photon and we produce an excited
state, that same electron now

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
has been taken away from our sum
total of bonding.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And it has been added to an
antibonding orbital.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And the effect of that is to
"labialize" one of the carbon

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
monoxide ligands,
allowing it to dissociate from

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the metal center producing an
unsaturated intermediate that

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
can be captured by the lone pair
of triphenylphosphine.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
That word I just used,
labialized, we have from Henry

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Taube.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Henry Taube,
Nobel Prize in 1983.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
If you want to read more about
Henry Taube and his

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
contributions to chemistry and,
in fact, the study of ligand

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
substitution reactions and the
relationship of reaction rates

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
to the population of the e g
star orbitals,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
then I would direct you to the
1983 section of the Nobel Prize

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
dot org website.
And you can read his biography,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
his Nobel Prize lecture and his
banquet address.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
These are all things that
Professor Schrock from our

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
department is doing this week in
Sweden, so shortly,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
you will be able to read his
contributions to that website.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And I am sure you will all find
that to be pretty exciting,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
as I do.
But Henry Taube,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000
this Nobel Prize winner,
coined the terms "inert" and

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
"labile."
These terms,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
inert and labile,
they refer to rates of ligand

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000
substitution reactions.
If a complex is to be thought

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
of as inert, it isn't really
inert.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
What that means is that its
substitution reactions are slow.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And, on the other hand,
if a system is to be referred

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to labile, that means that its
ligand substitution reactions

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
are fast.
And over there on the left,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
we looked at a set of four
metal ions whose aqua-complexes

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
could be classified as either
inert or as labile.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So let me relate that to the
occupation of the eg star

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
energy level.
Here what we have,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
t(2g) and e(g)*.
In the case of chromium three

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
plus or vanadium two
plus,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
since vanadium is in Group 5
and chromium is in Group 6,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
both of these metal ions have a
d three electron

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
configuration.
And so, when we populate our

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
d-orbital splitting diagram for
these two systems,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
here is the result.
We have an s equals

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
three-halves ground state,
three unpaired electrons.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
The system is paramagnetic.
You could certainly calculate

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
the spin-only magnetic moment
for such a system.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And e(g)* is not occupied.
We have three electrons,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
here, in t(2g).
t(2g) is basically nonbonding

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
if the ligand is neither a
pi-base nor a pi-acid.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
This is three nonbonding
electrons centered in d(xz),

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
d(yz), and d(xy),
which is t(2g) on our metal ion

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
chromium three plus
in the hexa-aquo system or

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
vanadium two plus in
the hexa-aquo system.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And these are inert and slow.
And then, we have two more

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
cases to discuss.
And, again, here is our t(2g)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and our e(g)*.
Notice that if we go from

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
chromium three plus
to chromium two plus,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
we go up 15 orders
of magnitude in ligand

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
substitution rate just by
changing the charge by one unit.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And what is going on here?
Well, now chromium two

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
is d four,
and the four electrons go in

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and populate like this.
So eg* now has an electron in

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
it.
And that makes it related to

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
the excited state here of
tungsten hexacarbonyl because

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
both of those,
if you were to write out their

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
electronic configuration,
would have eg*1 as the

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
population of eg*.
In the case of copper two plus,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
we have a situation
similar to chromium two plus

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
in that the complex
is labile.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It is undergoing substitution
associated with a rate constant

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
here whose log is 9.
This is undergoing exchange of

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
water molecules from liquid
solution onto the metal very

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
rapidly.
And this is a d nine

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
case.
The electrons go in like this.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And this is an s equals
one-half system with a single

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
unpaired electron.
Both of these are paramagnetic.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Both of these have a population
of e g star.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And the two ions that have
e(g)* that contain electrons

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
have fast ligand exchange rates.
When e(g)* is not occupied,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
the ligand substitution rates
are very slow.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And we can understand that
because of the antibonding

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
character of e(g)*.
There is an additional nuance,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
which is when e(g)* is occupied
by an odd number of electrons,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
we can get what is called a
Jahn-Teller distortion.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And that distortion is a
structural response to the odd

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
electronic population of e(g)*.
It is a distortion of the

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
molecule that makes these
systems, the chromium two

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
and copper two
the fastest of all

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
the 3d metal ions for exchanging
water molecules.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Let's look at a structure of
one of these systems briefly.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Here is the result of a quantum
chemical calculation optimizing

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
the structure of chromium two
hexaaquo two plus.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
This system as a spin

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
polarization of four,
meaning we do have the four

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
unpaired electrons,
three of which are in t(2g) and

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
one of which is in e(g)*.
This is how the molecule

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
optimizes without using any
symmetry constraints based on

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
the density functional theory
model that is typically in use

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
these days for optimizing
geometries of molecules.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And what you can see is that
this program I am using to

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
display the structure is drawing
four of the lines from the

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
chromium ion to the oxygens.
And the other two it is not

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
drawing.
And the reason for that,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
if I go ahead and use the tools
in this program to find out just

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
what are those chromium oxygen
distances in this hexaaquo ion,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
what we find out is that four
of them, the four where it is

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
choosing to draw the lines
between the metal and the

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
oxygen, are about 2.1 angstroms.
Whereas, to the two oxygens

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
where it is not drawing the
metal oxygen line,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
the distance is about 2.45
angstroms.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
This molecule,
this hexaaquo ion,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
has decided to deviate from a
pure octahedral geometry because

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
what it has done is it has
stretched two of the oxygens

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
along an axis and made those two
water molecules move farther

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
away from the metal center.
And that has to do with the

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Jahn-Teller distortion that I
mentioned a moment ago,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
when e(g)* is occupied by an
odd number of electrons.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Now, if you see that two waters
have moved far away from the

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
metal and four are in closer as
a result of how e(g)* is

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
populated, then which d orbital
do you think has the e(g)*

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
electron?
d z squared*,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
that is right.
And that means the two

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
molecules that can interact with
the two big lobes of d z squared

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
along the axis,
those are repelled away from

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
the metal more than the other
four that are in the x,y-plane

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
because we don't have any
electron in x squared minus y

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
squared,
that other component of e(g)*.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
This molecule achieves its most
stable structure by distorting

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
in response to the unequal
occupation of e(g)*.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And I will just show you what
that orbital looks like by

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
quitting out of there.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Now this graphic,
sadly, isn't as nice as the one

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I could have shown you using my
laptop and VMD,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
but it will have to serve the
purpose.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And this is just a snapshot of
the orbital.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
It may not be possible to
increase the size of this.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Here we go.
I think it should be clear,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
from your inspection of this
diagram, that we actually

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
superposed a couple of different
representations of the system on

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
top of one another.
First of all,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
this program has drawn balls
and sticks to connect the atoms.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
You have a red ball here,
a red ball.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Each place there is a red ball,
that is an oxygen.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And at the center,
we have our chromium plus two

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
ion.
So these are our water

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
molecules.
And what you should be able to

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
see here is that this orbital,
on this water molecule up here

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
along positive z,
has an appearance that would

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
suggest that that is the highest
occupied molecular orbital of

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
the water molecule,
interacting with the big lobe

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
of d z squared in
this antibonding fashion where

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
we go from blue phase to red
phase as we go along the sigma

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
axis between the oxygen and the
metal center.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And then, in a better
representation,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
you would be able to see that
there are small contributions

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
from the four water molecules
that are interacting here with

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
the torus of the d z squared
orbital.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And then what you have down on
negative z is equal to what you

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
have on positive z.
Namely, you have an oxygen lone

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
pair here that is being repelled
by the electron occupying d z

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
squared,
which is one of our e(g)

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
components.
The idea is that systems like

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
this exchange water so very
rapidly, 15 orders of magnitude

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
more rapidly than a simple d
three system,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
because two of the water
molecules are repelled away from

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
the metal center quite a bit.
And it makes this structure

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
close to the transition state
for just losing a water molecule

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
from the coordination sphere and
dissociating it from the metal

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
center.
And that is what we are going

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
to talk about next.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Now, we are going to talk about
a reaction like that in terms of

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
a potential energy surface
diagram.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
We have seen how d orbital
occupation affects color and

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
magnetism and bonding between
metals and ligands.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And now we are seeing how
actually we can interpret

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
chemical reaction rates on the
basis of these electronic

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
structure considerations.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
We like to draw energy level
diagrams that have orbitals on

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
them or states on them,
but sometimes what we like to

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
do is to try to describe the
total energy of the system,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
fold all these different
coordinates into one and look at

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
the total energy of the system
as a function of where we are

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
along a chemical reaction
coordinate.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
That means as we progress
through a sequence of elementary

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
steps corresponding to a
chemical reaction.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
A complete description of any
reaction implies a knowledge of

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
the potential energy surface for
the reaction.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
We have our reaction
coordinate, and we desire some

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
kind of a plot that could
represent this reaction

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
coordinate.
And what that plot looks like

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
depends on the particular
reaction mechanism of the

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
reaction that you are
scrutinizing.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
If you have a reaction and you
want to know how it works,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
the first thing you do is make
a hypothesis.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And from your hypothesis,
you can build predictions about

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
the reaction coordinate,
and then you can test those

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
experimentally.
And either your hypothesis will

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
turn out to be consistent with
the predictions or not.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And, if not,
you reject the hypothesis and

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
start again.
It has been said,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
concerning reaction mechanisms,
that the closest you can get to

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
the truth is your own best
guess.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But the way that people test
reaction mechanisms is through

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
studying reaction rates under
various conditions and comparing

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
the results to those predicted
by your hypothesis.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And so here is a hypothesis for
a dissociative mechanism for the

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
type of ligand substitution
reaction that we are talking

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
about.
A dissociative mechanism means

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
that the mechanism proceeds by
dissociation of one of the

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:52.000
ligands from the metal center as
the first important step of the

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
reaction.
We have down here some ML five

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
X compound.
And let's say we have it in a

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
solvent Y, where the solvent can
also act as a ligand.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
And we are interested in what
rate profile will we have if,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
at the end of the reaction,
down here in this well,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
this is meant to represent a
potential energy well where now

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
we have X replaced by Y,
--

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
-- as illustrated there.
That is the overall result of

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
the reaction.
But how does it take place?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Are there any intermediates in
the reaction?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
And so, in a dissociative
mechanism, what happens is that

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
there is an intermediate.
And it occurs here in this

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
intermediate well.
One thing that you are going to

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
be interested in distinguishing
between, on potential energy

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
diagrams, will be potential
energy minima.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Because these potential energy
minima that I have just colored

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
in, those correspond to starting
materials, products,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
or intermediates.
And then, alternatively,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
you can have potential energy
maxima on the potential energy

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
surface.
This is a two-dimensional

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
diagram.
And what it really represents

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
is a two-dimensional slice
through a three-dimensional

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
surface that has hills and
valleys on it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And these hills on the
potential energy surface

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
represent energy barriers to a
chemical reaction.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
What we are going to have at
these points of high energy will

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
be things that we call
transition states.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And you start out down here at
the starting materials,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
the reaction will proceed to
the right, we are assuming in

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
this case, and you go up hill in
energy first.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
You have to surmount this
energy barrier associated with

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
this first transition state,
or TS1.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And when you system has gone
over that first barrier,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
if it is a dissociative
mechanism, that produces an

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
intermediate ML five.
Because X has dissociated from

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
the metal center and Y,
of course, being the solvent,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
is still there.
And then, once we get down into

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
this well, this potential energy
minimum, this valley associated

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
with the intermediate ML five,
it is a five coordinate

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
intermediate,
so it should have a structure

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
of the trigonal bipyramid or the
structure of a square pyramid.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And, over there,
I was talking about the

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
distortion of that molecule
based on its occupation of e(g)*

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
having repelled two of the water
molecules farther away from the

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
metal than the other four.
And what that does is it begins

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
to lower the energy barrier here
to get over to TS1.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
It makes it easier for one
ligand to fall off the metal

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
center because it is being
repelled by that d z squared

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
electron.
And what we will see is that we

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
can associate rate constants
with each of these barriers.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
This is the second instance
today that I have used the term

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
rate constant.
And we are going to want to

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
distinguish the term "rate
constant" from the term

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
"reaction rate."
And one of our goals today is

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
to understand the difference
between a reaction rate and a

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
rate constant.
Going up this first hill,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
over TS1 and down into the
intermediate state,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
where you have a five
coordinate species and X has

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
become freely dissociated from
the metal center,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
that is k1.
And then, when you are down in

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
the valley, there are two ways
out of the valley.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You can either go back in the
direction of TS1.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
We call that back reaction k
minus one.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
We associate the rate constant
k minus one with the back

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
reaction that would take us back
over the same transition state

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and back to the starting
materials.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
That would be a nonproductive
step because it is going in the

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
wrong direction.
And then, over here,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
ML five has this
branching option.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
When you are at the stage of
the intermediate,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
you can go either back to
starting materials or you can go

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
onto products.
And this rate constant we will

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
call k two for the
reaction in which the molecule Y

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
that is doing the substituting
would add to ML five.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
That is associated with some
barrier.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And it produces the six
coordinate ML five Y and X

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
dissociated.
And then, finally,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
in this last step we would call
the rate constant associated

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
with going back into the
intermediate from the products,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
we would call that k minus two
for that rate

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
constant.
This is how you begin to write

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
out the math associated with a
hypothetical reaction mechanism.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And so, for those of you who
are gearing up to take 18.03

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
next semester,
Differential Equations,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
you are going to find that this
is one area in chemistry where

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
differential equations become
extremely valuable.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Because you are going to
generate differential equations

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
that describe the kinetics of a
chemical reaction system.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
And those equations will differ
depending on the hypothetical

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
mechanism.
And you are going to want to

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
figure out which hypothetical
mechanism actually fits your

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
data.
Here is one limiting case,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
but let me first just --

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I am going to leave that,
given the amount of time here.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
We are going to go ahead and
talk about a limiting case.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
When I use square brackets
here, I am going to be talking

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
about concentration,
just like we did when we were

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
talking about acids and bases
and so forth.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Square brackets denote
concentrations.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
If k2 times Y,
and I will stick with the green

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000
color for Y, is much greater
than k minus one times the

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
concentration of X,
hat corresponds to

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
a limiting case.
We are also going to make

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
another assumption,
here.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
We are going to say assuming
complete reaction.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
What does that mean?
That means that k minus two

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
times the concentration of ML
five Y times the concentration

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
of X at the end
corresponds to essentially

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
a negligible back reaction such
that when we get to products we

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
stop, this is a very deep well,
and we don't go back anymore

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
once we get over to the
products.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Under those conditions,
we have made two

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
simplifications.
Then, the reaction rate.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And, when we talk about
reaction rate,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
we usually define it in terms
of the disappearance of the

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
starting materials or
alternatively the appearance of

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
the products,
the rate of appearance of the

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
products in a system like this.
And, under the conditions of

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
those assumptions,
the reaction rate is going to

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
depend on k1 times the
concentration of the starting

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
material.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Times the concentration of our
entering group Y.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And that says that every time
we get over the first barrier,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
we rapidly get over the second
barrier without going back.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
That is the assumption here
that k two times the

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
concentration of Y is much
greater than k minus one times

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
the concentration of X.
This is

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
often true when the
concentration of Y is very

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
great.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
i.e., Y is the solvent.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
In the case of water,
you have essentially 12 molar

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Y.
Y is your solvent.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And, because of that,
under these circumstances,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
the concentration of Y,
which is very large,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
does not change effectively
during the reaction.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
It is a constant that can be
folded into together with the

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
constant k1.
So we can describe this as k

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
observed.
K observed is equal to k1 times

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Y times ML five X. And

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000
these are what we call
pseudo-first order conditions.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
That is a particularly simple
rate law.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And a lot of times,
experimentalists will engender

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
pseudo-first order conditions by
purposely using an entering

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
group concentration that is very
large.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And, when you do that,
you will find that,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
for example,
the change in concentration

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:47.000
with time of ML five X
is, upon integration,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
when you integrate differential
equations such as this,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
you can obtain expressions for
the concentrations of these

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
species of interest as a
function of time.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:17.000
So we can obtain ML five X of t
divided by ML five X at t equals

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
zero is equal to e to the minus
k observed, that contains that

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:36.000
large invariant concentration of
y folded into it times t.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Hence, this single exponential
decay of the starting materials

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
predicted by this mechanism
under these conditions for the

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
change in concentration with
time of your starting material.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Finally, what you do seek is to
follow, as a function of time,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
the concentration of the
species involved such that,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
for example,
you may be following,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
here, the decay of your
starting species ML five X.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
As a function of time,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
you seek an expression for
that.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
There are different methods to
carry out the integration

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
required for more complicated
rate laws than did appear there

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
for the pseudo first-order
mechanism.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
But, simultaneously,
as ML five X decays,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
the concentration of ML five Y
would be increasing.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And under the simple case shown
here, where the intermediate

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
does not build up to any
substantial concentration,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
this is no buildup of
intermediate,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
meaning whenever the
intermediate is formed it either

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000
goes back to starting materials
or goes on to products.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:46:03.000
In other words,
the intermediate never attains

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:38.000
significant concentrations
relative to starting materials

00:46:38.000 --> 00:47:06.000
and final products.
This is the basis for the

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:43.000
steady state approximation that
is explained in your notes.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And I will go through that also
at the beginning of the hour on

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Friday.
Have a nice day.

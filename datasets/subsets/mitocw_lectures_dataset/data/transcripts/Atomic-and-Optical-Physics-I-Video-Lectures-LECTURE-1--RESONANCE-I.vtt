00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.855
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to a new teaching,

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:32.872
new lecturing of 8.421.

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:38.680
8.421 is an advanced course in
atomic physics-- graduate level

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.430
course.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.230
8.421 is part of a new semester
sequence in atomic physics.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.550
Actually, 8.421 is taken
first in this sequence

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.960
because we start with more basic
things about light and atoms.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.280
But the cost is
designed in such a way

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.480
that you can start
with 8.422 or 8.421.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.225
So just to get an idea, who
has already taken 8.422?

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:12.670
Should be about half the class.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.790
OK, great.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.700
So yes, you're not
repeating anything.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.570
And maybe for those of you
it's a little bit anticlimactic

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.990
because you had all the fun.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.260
You saw all the
great things which

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.510
can be done with
two level systems.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.415
And now in this
course we sit down

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:33.920
and I explain to you what
are those two levels.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.170
What happens to those two
levels in magnetic field

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.350
and electric fields?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.540
How are what they modified by
the lens shift and all of that?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.790
But you see how the two
things are connected.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.940
I talk about some course
formalities in a few moments.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.070
But let me first point
out that you're interested

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.240
or you're doing research in
atomic physics at a really

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.860
exciting time.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.060
AMO science is booming
and is rapidly advancing.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.430
And a lot of it is really
do to, well, of course,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.260
new insight, new ideas,
new breakthrough,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.420
but also combined
with technology.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.235
We have seen over the
last couple of decades

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.500
a major development
in light sources.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:43.510
If I remember what lasers
I have used in my PH.D.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.700
And what lasers you were using,
well, there's a big difference.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.940
Big difference in performance
but also big difference

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.360
in reliability and convenience.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.060
But just a few systems which
didn't exist a few decades ago.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.080
The Ti:sapphire laser, which
has really become the workhorse

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.710
of generating lots and lots of
power in the infrared domain.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.090
But then it can
also be frequency

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.722
doubled to the visible.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.760
When I was a [INAUDIBLE]
in the early '90s,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.920
people just starting to use
diode lasers in atomic physics.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.880
Here you are 20 years later.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.680
We see you much more
solid state lasers.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.610
And I would say even in
the last 5 to 10 years

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.330
there has been another,
well, revolution

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.160
is too strong a word but
another major advance by having

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.590
extremely high power fiber
lasers, which are covering

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.460
more and more of
the spectral range.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.710
So those advanced lasers
empower in the spectral range.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:08.480
We have seen major advances
in shaping short pulses.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.550
I remember when I was a student
how femtosecond lasers were

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.450
that the latest--
well, they're required.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.700
The [INAUDIBLE] and femtosecond
pulses could only be produced

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.990
in a few laboratories in
the world with a discovery

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.940
of the Ti:sapphire laser
in Kerr lens mode locking.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.930
This has now become standard and
is even commercially available.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.650
But researchers have pushed
on attosecond policies

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.480
are now the frontier
of the field.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:47.970
Well, if you have very short
pulses that also opens up

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.120
the possibility to go
to very high intensity,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.060
you don't need so
much energy per pulse.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.170
You just, if the
pulse is very short,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.620
you reach a very high intensity,
which is the range of terawatt.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.850
And it is now pretty standard
if you focus the short pulse

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.515
laser.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.960
In the focus of the
short pulse laser,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.140
you create electric
field strengths,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.780
which are stronger than the
electric field in an atom.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.790
So therefore, the
dominant electric field

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.110
is the one of the laser.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.660
And then you may add
[INAUDIBLE] on whatever scheme

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.040
the field between the electons
or the electron and the proton.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.050
So this is the
generational flight.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.540
But light also
wants to be control.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.625
And this is done
by using cavities.

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:44.820
A single photon
would just fly by.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.300
But If you want a photo to
really intimately interact

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.040
with a atom-- maybe
get it absorbed,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.100
immediate absorbed, immediate.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.690
If you really want to have the
photon as a [INAUDIBLE] state

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.750
and not just as
something which flies by,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.770
you need cavities,
resonators, and we have really

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.350
seen peak advances in
superconducting cavities

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.320
as super codings in
the optical regime.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:19.852
And cavity QED in the optical
and the microwave domain

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:23.000
have led to major
advances in the series

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.100
of spectacular
experiment performed now

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.830
with single photons.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.200
So the single
photon is no longer

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.395
an idealized concept for
the description of life atom

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:38.220
interaction.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.070
It has been a reality.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.770
And single photon control
has advances quickly.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.180
Well you can make major
advances in terms of light.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.320
Find new lasers, shorter
policies, higher intensity

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.260
policies, and things like this.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.450
But the other part of atomic
physics-- one is light,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.960
the other one are the atoms-- we
haven't invented new atoms yet.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.320
We still got stuck with
the same periodic table.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:19.060
But we have modified the way
how we can prepare and control

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.140
atomic samples.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.310
A big revolution
in the '90s or '80s

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.245
has been the cooling of
atoms that now microkelvin,

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:33.550
nanokelvin, and with
evaporative cooling,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.620
even picokelvin regime
had become possible.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.830
In terms of atomic
samplers, this

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.160
was an evolution which
took place during my time

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.760
as a researcher.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.296
Atoms always mean you're the
sample of individual atoms.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.670
Sometimes you
started interaction

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.680
when two atoms are colliding.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.790
But atomic physics
was really the physics

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.150
of senior particles
or two particles

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.770
interacting, colliding,
or forming a molecule.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.170
But the moment we reach for
cooling nanokelvin temperature,

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.170
atoms move so slowly that
they feel out each other.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.200
And that means suddenly
we have a system

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.170
to do many-body physics.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:31.930
So the event of quantum
degenerate gases

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.535
and many developments after that
with optical lattices and lots

00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:39.600
of bells and
whistles really meant

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.090
that-- and this dramatic--
that atomic physics

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.220
has made the transition
from single and two particle

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.633
physics to many body physics.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.670
And for several research
groups in this end

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.480
of what are called
atoms, this is,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.130
of course, an
important point here.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.170
Well, somewhat related to
that but more generally,

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.270
the precision and
preparation and manipulation

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:24.350
which atomic physics has
reached with quantum systems

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.920
puts now atomic physics
in a leading position

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.820
at the forefront of exploring
new aspects of Hilbert space.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.520
One can say that
Hilbert space is vast.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.630
But what is realized,
this simple quantum system

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.420
is only a tiny little
corner of Hilbert space.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.670
And atomic physics,
if I want to define it

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.780
in the most abstract
way, the goal

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.370
is to master Hilbert space.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.570
And that means we
want to harness

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.980
parts of Hilbert space,
which are characterized

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.010
by quantum entanglement.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.320
Maybe single forms
between two particles

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.460
but also between many particles.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.220
And of course, this is it
to a whole new frontier

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.135
in quantum computation and
quantum information processing.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:28.270
So this sort of should show
you how technology, new ideas,

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.510
control, and manipulation
is suddenly opening up

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.070
whole new scientific directions.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.750
And just to add something
more recent to the list,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.080
we have now a major
research direction

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.440
in AMO physics dealing
with cold molecules.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.290
And they're even prospects
of rewritting chapters

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.010
of chemistry.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.540
What happens when
you do chemistry

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.640
but not in the ordinary way
but at nanokelvin temperature?

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.310
Or what happens when
you do chemistry

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.140
where you have coherent
control in such a way

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.280
that maybe the molecules
before and after the reaction

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.620
are in a cool and
superposition state.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.020
So in that sense, the
conclusion of that introduction

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.480
is atomic physics
has been successful

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.605
because it continues
to redefine itself.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.880
And to prove the case, I
can say when I predict,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.461
when I try to
predict-- I didn't even

00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:45.960
try because I know
it wouldn't work.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.800
But if I tried to
predict 10 years ago what

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.730
would be the hot topics of
today, I would have failed.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:57.950
What happens is just
breakthroughs and discoveries.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.750
And usually they happen in areas
where they are not predicted.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.660
As another angle,
atomic physics has

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.880
seen more than its usual
share of Nobel prizes

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.290
in the last two decades.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.440
Maybe the price in
1989 for ion trapping

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.792
in Ramsey spectroscopy.

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:32.420
Ramsey spectroscopy is used for
the generation of atomic clock.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.920
Iron trapping is a
basic building block.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.380
This was sort of givenof
some of the technology.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.090
But this was the only prize in
the long list I'm writing down

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.990
now which was given for
something which was maybe

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.500
invented a few decades ago.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.990
A lot of Nobel prizes are given
decades after the discovery.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.030
But all the more recent
Nobel Prize and this

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.130
speaks for the
vitality of the field,

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.600
we awarded for
developments which had just

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.270
happened in the decade
before the prize.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:08.790
Whether it was laser cooling
just invented in the '80s.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.970
Whether it was Bose
Einstein condensation

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:18.030
observed for six years
before the 2005 prize

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.440
on precision spectroscopy with
lasers and frequency comb.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.460
This was also a development that
happened just a few years ago.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.790
And the most recent recognition
for Serge Haroche and Dave

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.640
Wineland is about
the manipulation

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.490
of individual quantum system.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.890
And this is where the
highlights of this

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:46.320
were accomplished just
a few years, lets say,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.810
over the last five or 10 years.

00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:11.070
OK.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.120
Just sort of to make
a general case here,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.020
I continue to be amazed
how interesting ad

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.470
rich the physics of
simple systems are.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:36.330
I actually expect that there
maybe even two Nobel Prizes

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.390
in the near future
for, pretty much,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.340
understanding the
Schrodinger equation.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.520
You would say this has been
done in the old days of quantum

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.280
mechanics in the '20s and '30s.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.700
And of course, lots of
people have been recognized.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:56.030
But there are two aspects
of the Schrodinger equation,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.390
which hadn't been
understood or which

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.430
have been understood
only recently.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.850
One is the aspect of
entanglement and error

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.300
correction.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.560
Nobody until 10 or
20 years-- nobody

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.810
until [INAUDIBLE]
and collaborators

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.790
introduced error
correction would

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.190
have thought that the quantum
system can [INAUDIBLE] here,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.710
but you can
reestablish coherence

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.230
by what is called quantum
error corrections.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.650
[INAUDIBLE] properties of the
simplest wording or equation

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.330
for just a few--
well, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.030
it's for a few particles--
which we are not known

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.420
or even the expert in the
field would have fled and said,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.150
no, this is not possible.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.130
And another aspect of actually
single particle quantum

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.340
physics, which has been fully
appreciated only recently

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.730
is the question of [INAUDIBLE]
phase and topological phase.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.500
All the [INAUDIBLE] in
quantum metaphysics,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.780
which is also spilling over
to atomic physics of quantum

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.730
[INAUDIBLE]
topologically insulate

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.730
as an [INAUDIBLE] means that
there are non-trivial phases--

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:05.612
non-trivial symmetries in the
single particle Schrodinger

00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:07.070
equation.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.630
So it's just that
as a case in point

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.300
that the single particle
Schrodinger equation a lot

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.380
of people thought in
the '40s and '50s.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:14.880
That's it.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.800
There is nothing
else to do research.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.580
And now we when whole
new fields emerging

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.610
exploiting new aspects of
the Schrodinger equation.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.640
Will there be something
else of the same caliber

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.510
to be discovered?

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.940
20 years ago, people
would've said no.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.287
And I just gave you two examples
of major new insight, which

00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:39.370
is has really changed our
understanding of quantum

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:39.869
physics.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.930
A few years ago, I served
on a National Academy

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:56.170
of Science committee trying to
do the impossible to predict

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.660
the future of the field.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.575
But sometimes the National
Academy of Science

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:05.450
is asked to give advice and try
to provide the best [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.250
impossible but is exciting.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.130
Of course, we didn't
predict the future.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.910
But at least to the
extent possible,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.650
we summarized what are
the frontier areas where

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.400
we see rapid
development and where

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.310
it would be worth
investing further.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.260
And you will actually see that
a number of those frontier areas

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.070
are where your research happens.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.370
One is the traditional area
of precision measurements.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.170
As long as atomic
physics exists,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.452
one of the specialty
of atomic physics is we

00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:50.200
can emphasize
measurements, atomic locks,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.430
and precision measurements of
fundamental concepts and all

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.590
that.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.970
And that continues
until the present day.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.040
It was just two weeks ago
that there was a new nature

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.640
paper on the really major
advance in atomic clocks.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.000
Strontium neutral atom clock
has reached the precision

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.839
of 6 times 10 to the minus 18.

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:13.380
It's amazing.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.010
We'll talk more about it.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.290
You really have to carefully
understand and measure

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.830
small changes in the black-body
radiation because just

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.844
the black-body radiation
creates frequency shifts, which

00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:26.385
would interfere with
their precision.

00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:29.280
An amazing accomplishment
for the field.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.100
So precision
measurements continue

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.180
to be an important frontier.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.370
Of course, is there's always
the aspect of metrology,

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.580
determine time frequency,
and other things

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.500
with higher and higher accuracy.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.960
But there are also applications.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.560
Just one example is
making atomically.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.620
Atomic physics methods
can be now used

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.075
if you open at home
in an environment you

00:18:55.075 --> 00:18:57.290
can measure the magnetic field.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.430
So people are now talking
by using atoms or artificial

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.170
atoms in the form of AV senders
to measure the magnetic field,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.320
biological sounds, and all that.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.540
So measurement is
fundamental aspects

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.430
but is also applied aspects.

00:19:15.352 --> 00:19:17.690
Well, other frontiers
are, of course,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.230
you can use support ultra cold.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.820
We've talked about
high intensity lasers.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.605
Ultra intense.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.270
Ultra short.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.280
Atomic physics is
more and more getting

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.840
involved with nano materials.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.480
Materials with blue properties.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.190
Maybe materials with negative
index of the refrection,

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.400
metamaterials or, in general
or plus [INAUDIBLE] materials.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.790
Nano materials can help
to shed light and explore

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.560
new aspects of how light
interacts with matter.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.100
And of course,
the major frontier

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.565
is the frontier of
quantum information.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.100
So given all this
excitement, you

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.880
have many reasons to want
to learn more about it.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.974
And this course is definitely
a good starting point.

00:20:32.974 --> 00:20:34.390
Let me maybe tell
you a little bit

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:39.370
what is the philosophy behind
the cost and what you will get.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.500
That means, of course,
at the same time

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.650
what you will not get.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:50.100
This course is meant as an
systematic, basic introduction

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.200
into AMO physics.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.780
It should really lead
the basic foundation

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.630
that when you talk about
atoms to talk about light

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.780
you are really an expert and you
can talk about it at the most

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.190
profound level.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.250
So it's important here, and
this is the goal of this course,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.860
to provide enough knowledge
and enough foundation for that.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.240
So it's not a cause
where I just try

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.740
to sample highlights
of the field

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.770
and provide you with a
semi understanding of all

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.330
this wonderful phenomena.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.570
I rather try to focus on
selective basic things

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.220
but then also exciting things
but rather explain them

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.240
thoroughly and teach you by
example than teaching you

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.230
the big overview.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.830
The course, if I
want to characterize,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:57.480
is I would say it is
a conservative course.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.680
It's also, r in this
sense, traditional.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.860
One reason for that is MIT.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.170
The tradition we have at MIT.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.470
At MIT we have this
several generations

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:17.270
of atomic physicists who
have shaped the field.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.710
And I learned atomic
physics as a postdoc

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.160
from Dave Pritchard, who was
a graduate student of Dan

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.700
Kleppner.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.130
Dan Kleppner was a graduate
student from Norman Ramsey.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:36.170
And Norman Ramsay was
a postdoc with I Rabi.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.560
And Rabi resonance
is this reciprocating

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.790
of atomic physics.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.370
The resonance is sort
of what we will also

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.400
focus on today and
in the first week.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.710
This is, sort of, the
most important concept

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.920
in atomic physics
to really understand

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.340
the nature of resonances
and all its implication.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.900
So I should say late in
my life-- I was already

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.200
passed 30-- when I took
the first atomic physics

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.315
class in my life, I took
it from Dave Pritchard.

00:23:04.315 --> 00:23:06.150
And I was really,
sort of, amazed

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:11.070
about the course, which
had the traditional topics

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.880
but provided a lot of insight.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.920
You can teach
traditional physics

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.240
from the perspective of somebody
who does research today.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.890
So I want to give
you all connections.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.130
But at the same
time, I like a lot

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.200
about the traditional approach.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.950
And some of it can be traced
back to Norman Ramsey.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.770
So eventually, over
the last years,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.910
I was the main person who has
shaped that on atomic physics

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.360
course when I expanded it from
one semester to two semesters.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.470
But when I created
a lot of new topics,

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.110
I always looked through Dan's
and Dave's notes and made

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:54.090
sure the best of what they
taught, the best ideas they put

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.670
the course, they still
survive until the present day.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.275
So this course is a
development and continuation

00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:03.260
of a longstanding tradition.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.760
I should say I
have been immensely

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.010
enjoyed to co-teach the
course on a couple of occasion

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.500
with Vladan Vuletic
and Ike Chuang.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.600
And Ike has made
major contribution

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.640
to the second part of
the course and Vladan

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.580
especially to what
we will be discussing

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.150
in the next few weeks.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:33.070
So what I think is unusual-- you
won't find it in many textbooks

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:39.120
is that we start
out by discussing

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.570
the phenomenon of resonance
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:49.080
And we will emphasize for
a while the classical part

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.375
but then also, of course, go to
the quantum mechanical aspects

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:55.870
of resonance.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.850
Now I have to say this balance
between classical and quantum

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.130
mechanics is something
I will emphasize

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.220
again and again in the course.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.350
I can guarantee you in this
course I will sometimes ask you

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.330
interesting question, which
challenge your intuition.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.950
And you will most
likely recognize

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.590
that often when your intuition
goes completely wrong

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.680
it happens because
you believe too much

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.250
or you over-interpret one
aspect of quantum physics.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.520
If I then tell you, but wait a
moment, now think classically.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.530
Push the classical
concept further.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.580
Regard the electron and the
atom as an harmonic oscillator.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.230
Regard light scattering
as the effect

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.810
not of a quantum mechanical
atom but of a driven harmonic

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.730
oscillator.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.610
Suddenly, a lot of things which
come out of quantum mechanics

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.590
make much more sense.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.750
So I've often seen when I had
a conflict in my understanding.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:01.520
And it's a semi-classical and
quantum mechanical explanation,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.560
I've learned to trust much more
the semi-classical explanation.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.930
So that's why I feel it's
important to understand

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.700
the classical aspects.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.770
And usually I would
also say understand

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.760
the means to really
understand it's limits.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.300
And often I feel you can
understand the phenomenon only

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.400
when you have a quantum
aspect, a classical aspect,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.450
and we know exactly where they
overlap and where they differ.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.910
So to see even quantum
mechanical objects occasionally

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.810
from the classical perspective
provides additional insight.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.940
So therefore, I would
emphasize classical aspects.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.375
And for instance, it
may come for many of who

00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:47.840
as a surprise and you
will see that next week

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.901
that some aspects like the
generalized Rabi frequency,

00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:56.150
which you all or many of you
have seen for a two level

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.330
system.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.590
We find it in
classical resonance.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.970
Just the classic equation
of motion of a gyroscope

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.150
has a generalized
Rabi frequency.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.960
And I do feel that
it is absolutely

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.200
important for the understanding
of concepts that you know

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.696
where do the concepts emerge?

00:27:16.696 --> 00:27:17.320
Where are they?

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.610
Are they already there in
classical physics and survive

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.100
in quantum physics?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.450
Or is it something new,
which is genuinely quantum.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.900
So yes, I will teach a little
bit more classical physics

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.620
than in the standard
[INAUDIBLE] course.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:39.310
But because I've seen within
my own research experience

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.680
that it's healthy to shape
the intuition for the fuller

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.716
understanding of the
systems we're dealing with.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:55.300
So residence is an
overarching theme here.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.580
But then we have to
introduce our main players.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.860
The atoms come to stage.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:09.480
And we want to understand
the electronic structure,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.980
the fine structure, the
hyperfine structure,

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.220
you're going to
understand what happens in

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.210
magnetic, electric, and
electromagnetic light fields.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.090
We want to understand
in a deep way

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.013
how do atoms interact
with radiation.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.779
This also leads us.

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:35.820
There's a big difference.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.403
You would say, well, what's the
difference when atoms interact

00:28:38.403 --> 00:28:41.080
with microwave and atoms
interact with light.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.640
Well light or at high
frequency spontaneous emission

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.660
becomes important.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.020
And then you have an
open quantum system.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.460
You have an [INAUDIBLE],
which couples automatically

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.920
to many, many states.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.740
So that's why radiation
is different from just

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.140
electric and magnetic fields
because of the presence of all

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.590
the vacuum modes, and
we'll talk a lot about it.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.210
There's one special aspect
about the cost, which

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.020
I don't think I've seen in
textbooks in the same way.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.170
We are singling out
in a rather long unit

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.120
the aspect of line shape.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.255
OK, we talk a lot about
an atom as a resonance.

00:29:25.255 --> 00:29:27.730
But when you measure
the resonance,

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.330
there is a line shape.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.680
And I found it
extremely insightful

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.680
when I first saw Dave Pritchard
doing it in his atomic physics

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.500
course to just talk
about all aspects which

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.550
modify a resonance from a data
function from a stick diagram

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.640
into a real shape.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.770
It can be doppled up water.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.470
It can be finite
lifetime broadening.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.476
It can be inhomogenous field.

00:29:52.476 --> 00:29:54.225
But there are lots of
interesting effects.

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:57.250
And By discussing
them all together

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.240
you gain major insight.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.810
So we discuss how photon recoil,
how the velocity of atoms

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.950
effect the line shape.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:13.500
And if you think you've
understood everything,

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:20.265
I will talk to you about in a
very counter intunitive aspect

00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:24.460
of line shapes named
Dicke narrowing.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.990
If you put atoms
in the environment,

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.880
you would say they collide.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.270
This should lead to
collision and broadening.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.330
But there is one aspect where
collisions lead to narrowing.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.390
And that's sort of a highlight
of this chapter which really

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.070
sort of shows you
how actually all

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.215
of those broadening mechanisms
are somehow connected.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:57.840
Finally, and this puts us more
towards the end of the course,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.060
we want to understand what
happens when atoms interact not

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.840
just with one photon
but several photons.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.470
And then we talk about
multiple photon processes.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.810
I should actually
say that I'm also

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.070
emphasizing the multi
photon process a lot.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.070
I mean, often we just
simply do a transition

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.450
between two levels.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.450
And there is a operator that can
be single photon or two photon

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.930
operator, yes.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.560
But to understand the multi
photon aspect is important.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.750
And maybe to just give
you one aspect of it,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.330
when you think you do
one photon physics,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.610
often, you do two
photon physics.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.210
A lot of people think atoms
can absorb the photon.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.890
I've never seen
in my life an atom

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.480
which has absorbed a photon.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.530
The photon is
immediately readmitted.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.170
It's a scattering event.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.020
An atom cannot absorb the photon
for good because the lifetime

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.020
of the excited state is short.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.910
So when you think absorption
is a single photon event,

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.830
there is a limitation
where, yes, you're

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.850
allowed to think about it.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.340
But if you get confused
and it will confuse you,

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.420
then you need the fact that
every absorption process

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.415
is actually a two
photon process.

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:14.080
Photon in and photon out.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.840
And sometimes by remembering
that it's not single photons,

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.280
there are always two
photons involved,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.826
it helps you to avoid some
pitfalls of the similar photon

00:32:23.826 --> 00:32:25.490
picture.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.680
So therefore, multi photon, yes.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.510
It's not just high intensity
to photo transitions

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.970
and atomic and such.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.630
It's also about the
deeper understanding.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.880
How does the single photon
interact with atoms?

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.140
And finally, there
is something which

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.740
has fascinated many physicists.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.440
The question about coherence.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:55.380
And coherence is as
fascinating as it is diverse

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.260
because coherence can
have as many aspects

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.140
and has many implications.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.040
And I also like a lot in
this traditional MIT cause

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.384
that coherence is sort of
singled out as a chapter.

00:33:13.384 --> 00:33:15.550
And now I'll tell you about
all the different phases

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.180
of coherence in
this chapter and not

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.790
scattered throughout
the whole course.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.560
We have coherence
in single atoms.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.030
The simplest one is the
coherent superposition

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:35.980
of two level, which is so
simple that it's almost boring.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.850
But there is an
enormous richness

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.060
when we put in a third letter.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.900
About 20 years ago,
an understanding

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.540
of three level
physics has really

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.410
created a new
frontier in the field.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.090
Let me just tell you buzz words.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.510
Lasing without inversion.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.250
Electromagnetically
induced resonance.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.660
Those concepts happen due to
coherence between three levels.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.310
And we'll talk about that
towards the end of the course.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:10.080
Well we have coherence within
an atom between two different

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.550
or three different
energy levels.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.350
But we can have also
coherence between the atoms.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:22.810
And at that point, the atoms
interact not individually.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.130
They act collectively.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.790
And of course,
coherence between atoms

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.172
can be the coherence
of many atoms

00:34:31.172 --> 00:34:32.630
in a Bose-Einstein
condensate where

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.560
they form one big matter wage.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.944
But it can also
be the coherence.

00:34:38.944 --> 00:34:41.560
The atoms are not
coherent because they've

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.590
formed the Bose-Einstein
condensate.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:48.300
But they interact in a
coherent way with light.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.120
So there's only one aspect
where the atoms act coherently.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.960
They may be in different
quantum states.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.120
But the interaction with the
light is absolutely identical.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.380
And when it then comes
to optical properties

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.940
of the system, the
light doesn't care

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.650
if the atoms are different.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.220
The light only cares if
whether the atoms interact

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.661
with the light in an
absolute identical way.

00:35:12.661 --> 00:35:14.160
And then you have
certain symmetries

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.500
of the light atomic reaction.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.310
And these coherence
between many atoms

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:25.800
in the interaction
with light needs to-- I

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.270
just give you the passwords.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:32.570
It's responsible for
the process of phase

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.300
matching when you have a crystal
and frequency-doubled laser

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.460
light you want all the atoms
to interact coherently.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:51.040
And it is also important for the
phenomenon of super radiance.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.840
I found this
subject of coherence

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.900
particularly fascinating.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.790
I should say it was the
subject of coherence where

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:05.762
some maybe 10 years ago, I was
in a long lasting controversy

00:36:05.762 --> 00:36:08.286
with some colleagues
in my field.

00:36:08.286 --> 00:36:09.910
You know, they're
people like Phillips.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.076
When I met him, he's one
of the smartest [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:12.076 --> 00:36:14.310
atomic physicist and
one of the fastest ones.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.590
And ideas just fly
back and forth.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.030
And there was only
one example where

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.430
we disagreed over a
long period of time

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:24.510
where he had good,
intuitive arguments,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.210
I had good intuitive arguments,
and we couldn't agree.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.560
And this was related
to the question when

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.891
it came to warm
atom amplification.

00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:37.800
You know, some coherent
process, whether it

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.900
is really necessary to a
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.500
or whether you can get away
with less, which is more

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.040
the simple radiant way
where the atoms are

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:54.970
different on different states
but they have an identical way

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.738
to interact with light.

00:36:56.738 --> 00:37:00.300
And in the end, I could prove
that certain aspect which

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.420
all people thought
in the field were

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.635
due to the coherent nature
of atoms where sort of they

00:37:06.635 --> 00:37:08.840
were due to the fact
that these atoms can

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.680
be regarded as an atom laser.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.310
It was just some form of
super radiance in disguise.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.250
So anyway, you will notice
some of my own interest

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.600
in the chapter of
coherence when I teach it.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.870
So it's something which
is this phase matching

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.540
and super radiance is
the physics of the '50s.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.720
But a deeper
understanding of it really

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.830
developed when we had
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.970
and could put some of
those ideas to the test.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.940
So lets what you expect.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.330
Let's an overview
over the topics.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.490
The course will
have 26 lectures.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.390
And these are the
topics we cover.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.750
Do you have any questions
about the two levels

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.540
in the structure of the course?

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.070
There is something I'm
going to say about homework.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:15.230
This semester Ike Chuang
has teamed up with me.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.250
And as many of you
know, Ike is one

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:22.340
of the real drivers
of MITx, edX,

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.950
and digital learning at MIT.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:30.150
So he is now teaming
up with me and trying

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.330
to put some of the
pieces online that you

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.950
can have conceptional questions
where you can work on.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.650
And you will et
immediate feedback

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.160
whether you're on the
right track or not.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.815
So this is a new
element, which we

00:38:44.815 --> 00:38:47.220
ant to introduce to the course.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.020
I still think there
are certain problems

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.120
you have to just sit down
with a white piece of paper

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.640
not knowing what
to write and start

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.940
scribbling some creations.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.210
So we'll have
conventional problems.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.640
But you also want to
experiment to what degree

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.305
is it possible to use
elements of new technology

00:39:04.305 --> 00:39:07.690
of digital learning
for a course like that.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.240
I actually have
to say I regard it

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.290
as a really very interesting
and Paul promising experiment

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:19.060
to have some aspects of
teaching and learning

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.650
in a graduate course.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.270
When MIT does MITx
and, you know,

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.470
broadcasting education
to the whole world,

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.810
it's much easier
to think about what

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.610
to do when you have
a basic introduction

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.760
to classical physics
into circuit design.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.370
There is, sort of, a
standard curriculum.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.740
A lot of questions are simple.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.440
It's pretty
straightforward how you

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.280
can have simple questions as
multiple choice questions.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.000
But this is different.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.240
This is really a graduate
course in atomic physics.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.710
It's about deep and
profound understanding

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.880
of complicated and
complex physics.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.840
I'm not sure to what
extent those complexity can

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.300
be broken into smaller
elements, which

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.190
can be put up as multiple
choice questions.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.650
Probably not.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.010
But on the other hand,
since MIT will never

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.570
reach millions of people
with a graduate course

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.590
in atomic physics,
the whole interest

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.950
of going to the whole world
and reaching the whole world

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:19.510
is absent.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.470
And for me, I just want to
introduce this technology

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:29.440
to increase the residential
experience for you students.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.010
So for instance,
videotaping, I'm

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.920
not sure if these
videotapes will ever

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.460
be shown to a worldwide audience
before we make them available.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.590
But the primary audience
maybe people like you

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.080
who have a conflict
in attending a class

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.850
and you want to check what
was presenting in class.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:49.480
I also have the idea that
this would be in the future.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.600
Once we have the
videotapes, maybe I

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.160
can tell you look at the
video recording of the class.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.730
And instead of having
a lecture, we'll

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.320
just have a
classroom discussion.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.740
So these are aspects
I want to experiment.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.410
But it's sort of exciting to see
how can new technology be used

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.110
for a course, which is very,
very different from all

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:14.252
the other courses, which
have been put online at MIT.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:22.340
Well then, as expected,
we have some 20 minutes

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:41.712
to start with our first
topic, which is resonance.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:57.040
And resonance is
what describes what

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.890
is relevant for
two level systems.

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.560
And also, and we
will touch upon this,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.878
resonances are the way hope
precision measurements are

00:42:08.878 --> 00:42:09.378
made.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.955
So what is a resonance?

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:26.450
Well, we can first look at
the classical resonance.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:38.670
Well a resonance is something
where we have some variable

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:44.540
and it varies periodically.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:53.670
So in other words, yes,
there is a variable,

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.780
which an be anything.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.900
It can be the population
of quantum state.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.370
It can be an electric field.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.900
It can be the
position of an atom.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.790
It can be anything
you can think about

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.930
and anything you can measure.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:14.250
And if this variable
the varies periodically,

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.710
you have a resonance.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.840
Of course, the periodic
variation usually

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.900
requires that you
drive the system.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.350
So you first drive it.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.740
And then the system oscillates.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:41.930
And this means now that when
you drive the system-- so this

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.590
maybe a free oscillation.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:50.505
But now you drive the system
with a variable frequency.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.760
And what you then observe
is you observe a peak.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.950
So the phenomenon
of resonance is

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.770
that you have something
which can periodically vary.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:15.580
And when you drive it,
you see peaked response

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.895
when driven with a
variable frequency.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.780
Yep, this is pretty basic.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.560
And I don't want to
dwell much more about it.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:39.040
But I can tell you we are
interested in atomic physics

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.150
in every single possible
aspect of this resonance.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.310
The shape of the curve.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.020
How we can modify it.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.730
What happens when
we tie it strongly?

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.550
When we tie it weakly?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:56.390
I mean, resonance is really the
language we talk atoms with.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.870
So but here I just want to give
a lighthearted introduction.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.880
The first thing we want
to add to the phenomenon

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.540
that there is a resonance
at a certain frequency

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.650
is finite damping
that would mean,

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.140
after the system is
driven, the oscillation

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.595
does not last for an
infinite amount of time.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.340
And that implies that
when we drive the system

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:33.150
and look at the response
as a function of frequency,

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.716
it's there is a finite
[INAUDIBLE] delta

00:45:35.716 --> 00:45:37.020
f for the driven system.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:52.410
And as we will see in many ways,
the damping time in delta f

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.420
are related by
Fourier transform.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:09.940
And we usually
characterize oscillators

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.900
by the sharpness
of the resonance.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.690
And the sharpness
of the resonance

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:22.905
is a ratio of the beats of the
resonance and the frequency

00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:24.650
or the inverse of it.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.720
So if you have an oscillator,
the kilohertz and the resonance

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.560
is one hertz wide.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.990
We see the resonance has a Q--
a quality factor of 1,000--

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.420
and that means you
can observe a thousand

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.180
oscillations before the
oscillation decays away.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.165
So what is special about
atomic physics here?

00:46:55.165 --> 00:46:58.244
Why do I emphasize it
in the introduction

00:46:58.244 --> 00:46:59.410
of an atomic physics course?

00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:08.504
Well, the system is
that in atomic physics

00:47:08.504 --> 00:47:11.830
we often have exquisitely
isolated system.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:15.060
An atom [INAUDIBLE]
vacuum chamber or systems,

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.180
which are prepared with all of
the tools and the precision,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.600
which we have developed over
decades in atomic physics.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.520
And therefore, the result
is that in atomic physics

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.270
our oscillators
are characterized

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:40.490
by an extremely high
quality factor Q.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.130
And let me give you an example.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:57.720
If we look at an
optical excitation,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:05.860
the-- maybe let me point
out it's something you all

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.980
should try when you take
a class in atomic physics

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.550
and even more so when you do
research in atomic physics

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:16.870
that you have a few numbers
in your mind which match.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:21.150
So you know, every single
person in this room

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.840
should know what is
the frequency of light.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:30.090
How many hertz is-- what is
the frequency of a laser?

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.930
The number I usually
use for those estimates

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:35.976
is 10 to 15 hertz.

00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:39.371
Who knows what wavelengths this
laser-- 10 to the 15 hertz--

00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:39.870
is?

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.760
Well I view some visible light.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.780
But the speed of light
is 3 times 10 to the 10.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.040
So therefore, if I just use
the power 10 to the 15 hertz,

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.340
it has to be 300 [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.300
OK, so never forget that
for the rest of your life.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.630
300 nanometer is
10 to the 15 hertz.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.630
That means that most
of us who are working

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.965
with rubidium, lithium, and
sodium, which is 600 nanometer

00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:14.760
or 800 nanometer, the
frequency is more 5 times

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.990
10 to the 14 or 3
times 10 to the 14.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.780
But just as a ballpark
number, 10 to the 15 hertz

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.900
is 300 nanometer.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:29.140
OK, so if we have an
optical excitation

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:32.990
and many atoms have
that, what is the Q?

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:37.718
What is the quality
factor of this resonance?

00:49:37.718 --> 00:49:44.100
Well when you stabilize
you laser to a vapor cell

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.310
and you look at the
resonance, then you

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.730
observe in a vapor cell that you
have room temperature Doppler

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.820
broadening-- we'll talk about
Doppler broadening later

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.710
in this course-- that
usually corresponds

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:03.920
to a frequency on the
order of a gigahertz.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:15.670
And that means that your quality
factor is on the order of 10

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:20.070
to the 6-- a million.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:20.920
That's pretty good.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.030
A million oscillation.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.760
That's a very pure oscillator.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:32.322
But of course, you can do much
better if you do Doppler free

00:50:32.322 --> 00:50:32.863
spectroscopy.

00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:37.040
Either by having
the atomic beam,

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.550
which is intersected
at the right angle.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.820
Or even better, put the
atoms in an optical lattice.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.680
And this is what people are now
doing with the optical lattice

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.840
clocks that they put an
atom in optical lattice

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.090
where the Doppler broadening
is completely eliminated.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:51:03.690
If you take a metastable
level, the lifetime

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.330
of the exciting state
is, maybe, one second.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:14.270
And strontium and other atoms
have those metastable labels.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:18.290
Then you can actually
get aligned with,

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:20.680
which is one hertz.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.710
And the Q factor is on
the order of 10 to the 15.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:32.610
I will show you a graphic
example of such an experiment

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:36.830
in one hertz line widths
of an optical transition

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:41.600
for an optical clock experiment
in the next class on Monday

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.560
when I want to discuss
other aspects of it.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.150
But this is one of the
worlds best oscillator

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.200
you can imagine.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.282
10 to the 15.

00:51:50.282 --> 00:51:52.106
It's a mind boggling number.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.970
Well it's clear why
clocks have gone atomic.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:05.710
Mechanical systems
are actually not bad

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.300
but, of course,
not nearly as good.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:16.690
If you take quartz
oscillator, well you

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:23.030
can build pretty good clocks
out of quartz oscillators.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.540
You have quality
factors which vary

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.010
between a few thousands
and a million.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:33.840
The best values are
reached at low temperature.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:46.800
And actually, even in the
event of atomic clocks,

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.280
quartz oscillators or
sapphire oscillators still

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:56.480
play a roll because you
need, sort of, fly wheels.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.070
In atomic clock
you may interrogate

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.960
only every Ramsey spectroscopy.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.605
You know, every tens of
seconds you get a signal.

00:53:05.605 --> 00:53:08.230
And in between you
need a fly wheel.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:11.500
And then clocks, which have a
very high signal to noise ratio

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.535
but not the [INAUDIBLE]
help you to interpolate

00:53:13.535 --> 00:53:14.410
between measurements.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:22.320
We see actually a renaissance
of mechanical systems

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.530
in the form of
micro-mechanical oscillators.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.100
It was only achieved in
the last 2 or 3 years

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.420
that micro mechanical
oscillators could

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.910
be cool to the
actual ground state.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.300
And there's a lot of
interest of coupling

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.890
the emotion of the
mechanical oscillator

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:47.400
to an atomic oscillator because
they have different properties

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.040
and for parental computation
and other explorations

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.320
of Hilbert space you want to
have different oscillators.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.177
And, you know, combine the
best of the properties.

00:53:59.177 --> 00:54:00.885
So therefore, there
is a real renaissance

00:54:00.885 --> 00:54:03.480
in mechanical oscillators.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.740
And those micro-mechanical
mechanical oscillators

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.780
have often quality
factors of 10 to the 5.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:33.678
Here, I want to show you a
picture of a fairly nice one.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:44.080
Yeah, this is a micro
fabricated device.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.080
It looks like a little mushroom.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:54.150
And what happens is this
mushroom type structure

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:58.220
can confine light, which
travels around the parameter

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:01.770
as a so-called
whispering gallery mode.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.250
It's similar to an
acoustic mode, which

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:08.130
can travel in the dome
of a big cathedral.

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.490
That's how it was discovered.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.220
It's an amazing effect.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.360
I wish somebody would
demonstrate it to me.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.276
But if you go to one of
the ancient cathedrals

00:55:16.276 --> 00:55:20.520
and you're in a dome, somebody
can talk in one direction,

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.950
the sound can travel
around, and you can hear it.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.300
There's a guided
special mode, which

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.740
can travel around the
parameter of the dome.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.840
And here in the
microscopic domain,

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:36.490
it's light, which is confined
in such and resonated.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:56.540
So this is resonator for
whispering gallery mode.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:02.860
And that can have a Q on
the order of a billion.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.500
So the idea here
is that you have

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.760
either one of those
mushrooms or a glass sphere

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.740
and the light can,
sort of, travel around.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:44.040
And this is the
characteristics of this mode.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.680
Well you can go from
a tiny glass sphere

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.730
to astronomical dimensions.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.440
And you also find oscillators.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:06.080
And the Q of those
oscillators is not really bad.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:10.000
How good is the Q of the
rotation of the earth?

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:17.510
It fulfills all of
our requirements

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.970
for resonance and oscillator.

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.220
It's a [INAUDIBLE] phenomenon.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:31.580
The Earth rotates around
the sun once a year.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.690
And the question is
how stable is it.

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.765
Well the number is 10 to the 7.

00:57:38.765 --> 00:57:40.600
It has a Q of 10 to the 7.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.629
So the precision of the
rotation of the earth

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:47.170
is better than one
part in a million.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.510
You can also look at the
rotation of neutron star.

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:57.230
If those neutron stars
emit flashes of X-rays,

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.080
these are pulses, and you can
measure the rotation of neutron

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.980
stars, those neutron stars
have a quality factor of 10

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:05.934
to the 10.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:21.063
And of course, [INAUDIBLE]
says, if a resonance has

00:58:21.063 --> 00:58:25.190
a high quality factor, it can
be used for quality research.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:27.750
Then everywhere the line
is the more sensitive

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.750
you are to tiny little changes.

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:33.450
And you probably know that
this pulsar with a Q of 10

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:40.440
to the 10, well, has been
used for the first, also

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.170
indirect, observation
of computation waves.

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:48.192
The pulsar rotates with
a very precise frequency.

00:58:48.192 --> 00:58:50.400
And you can measure it with
one part of 10 to the 10.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.430
And people have seen
that, over the years,

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:57.680
the frequency of
rotation became smaller.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.400
And you can figure
out that it becomes

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.670
smaller by just one
part in 10 to the 10

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.500
because you're at this position.

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.960
And what happens is when the
pulsar rotates-- when a neutron

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.650
star rotates-- it emits
gravitational waves.

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:14.040
And the gravitational
wave is energy,

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.120
which is taking away from the
kinetic energy of the rotation.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.510
And therefore, the
pulses slows down.

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.540
So having an oscillator
with such a high Q

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:28.240
has an allowed researchers
to find a small effect

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.089
in the damping of this
oscillator, which in this case

00:59:31.089 --> 00:59:32.130
were gravitational waves.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.530
Of course, the story
I will tell you

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.047
is about very small changes
of atomic oscillators,

00:59:40.047 --> 00:59:41.880
which led to the discovery
of the Lamb shift

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.280
and to quantum electrodynamics.

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.650
But the story is the same.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:49.638
A high quality oscillator
is the tool for discovery.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
OK, so we've talked
about resonances.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.540
Of course, there are
resonances which are useful

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.650
and others which
are less useful.

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:13.150
By useful we mean
they're reproducible.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.520
We can really make a measurement
and trust it and repeat and do

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.630
it again.

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.300
And that's not enough
for being useful.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.680
You also want to learn
something about it.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.230
So usually, we got
resonances as useful

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:38.250
when they are connected
by a theory to something

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.870
we are interested in.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:49.450
It can either be
fundamentally constance

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:54.318
or let me say other
parameters of interest.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.420
If you want to measure the
magnetic field with very

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.970
high precision and you
look at atomic resonance,

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:08.220
it's only useful when you
[INAUDIBLE], which tells you

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.970
how the shift or the
broadening of the resonance

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.970
is related to magnetic fields.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:19.460
And this is, again, a
specialty of AMO physics.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.090
We have plenty of
resonances, which

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:24.260
are useful by those standards.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.010
And if you compare to
astrophysical oscillators,

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:44.430
or quartz oscillators, or
fabricated oscillators,

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:49.130
in atomic physics, we
have the great advantage

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.210
that atoms are identical.

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.170
We know when you measure the
concision atomic hydrogen

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.030
in Japan and Europe and
in the United States,

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.390
the venue has to be the same.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:04.620
For other oscillators,
you often don't note It.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.060
So the showcase
of atomic physics

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:33.650
is the Rydberg constant,
which is the best known--

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.300
the most accurately known--
constant in all of physics.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.750
And the reason is because
it can be directly measured

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.830
by performing spectroscopy
and hydrogen with highly

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:44.580
stabilized lasers.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:03:00.790
OK, of course, the question is
who's interested in all those

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:01.820
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.811
Why do you want to spend
all of your PhD or half

01:03:04.811 --> 01:03:09.930
of your life measuring the
Rydberg constant to, maybe,

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:12.510
10 times more precision?

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.760
Well it depends.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.640
It's maybe not
something for everybody.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.610
But there are some
connoisseurs who

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:25.800
think that every
digit has provided

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.120
new inside into nature.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.360
And let me just give
you one example.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.700
If you measure the Rydberg
constant very precisely,

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.900
you can now-- and
this has become

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.170
the frontier of our
field-- ask the question,

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:44.340
is their change with time
a fundamental constance?

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:51.460
So when you measure the
Rydberg constant today with 10

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.150
to the minus 15 precision
and measure it again

01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:57.890
in a year, who is
guaranteeing to you that you

01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:00.450
will measure the same value.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.700
So with the precision
which I've just

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.660
given to you in this measurement
of the Rydberg constant,

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.690
people are now able to
say whether the Rydberg

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:15.370
constant has changed 10
to the minus 15 per year.

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:20.710
Of course of know, the
age of the universe

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:26.010
is 14 billion years.

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:28.490
That's about 10 to the 10 years.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.510
So even the worst case is
that if you would go back

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:35.460
to the beginning of the universe
and the Rydberg constant would

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.230
change to 10 the
minus 15 per year,

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.800
it would've changed
by 10 to the minus 5

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.090
over the age of the universe.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.920
But this would be climatic
because the connection shows

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.620
that life would
not have developed.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.020
The whole organic chemistry
would have been different

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.950
if some fundamental
constant of nature

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:59.310
had been different by one part
in 10 to the minus 6, 7, or 8.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.060
So you have extremely
stringent limits

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.160
how much fundamental
constant could

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.820
have changed through
the evolution of life

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.150
because life would
not have been the same

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.970
if fundamental
constant had changed.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.350
The question, of
course, is should

01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.055
those fundamental
constant change.

01:05:17.055 --> 01:05:18.920
Well the answer
is we don't know.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.410
But there is a whole research
area in string theory

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:27.710
where they say that our
universe is, sort of, just

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:32.180
one of many possible minima
in a multi-dimensional space.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.770
And it's actually dynamic
minima [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:36.510
changes the function of time.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:38.880
So there are people who
wouldn't be surprised

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.200
if the world is not
the same in the future

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.240
as it is right now
because the universe

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.250
or whatever defines fundamental
constants is changing

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.940
as a function of time.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.260
So the question is will
it be during your lifetime

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.870
or will it even
be during, maybe,

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:01.050
your PH.D when one
researcher says you know

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:01.935
have an [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:01.935 --> 01:06:07.040
And we find out that, yes, we
measure fundamental constant

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.060
using the most
accurate atomic clock.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.150
And a year later, you
have measured something

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:15.910
that's just a tiny bit but
significantly different.

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:18.650
The second aspect why you
should always measure things

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:20.984
as accurately as
possible and this

01:06:20.984 --> 01:06:22.650
is, sort of the,
tradition of our field.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:25.000
If you can measure
something very accurately,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.430
do it because, yes,
there maybe surprising.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:36.180
And for instance, when people
looked at the Zeeman shift

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.690
with higher
precision, they found

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.610
where we talk about
when we talk about atoms

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:44.620
in the magnetic field
when people looked

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:50.070
at the anomalies Zeeman
effect, the discovery of that

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:51.990
is what nobody expected.

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:55.480
That particles
electron has a spin.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.520
Or when people saw a tiny
shift in the spectrum

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.950
of atomic hydrogen, it was
1,000 megahertz splitting.

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:06.497
It was the Lamb shift.

01:07:06.497 --> 01:07:08.580
This was the discovery of
quantum electrodynamics.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:31.180
And we know that precision
always becomes a tool.

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.590
A tool to control atomic systems
control quantum mechanics

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.916
with more precision.

01:07:36.916 --> 01:07:38.790
For instance, if you
can completely, sort of,

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:41.425
hyperfine structure,
you can prepare atoms

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.633
in a certain hyperfine state.

01:07:42.633 --> 01:07:44.904
If you don't have the
resolution, you can't do that.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:59.800
OK so we're now going to talk.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.110
Go back to the resonance.

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:16.406
When we look at
typical resonance,

01:08:16.406 --> 01:08:18.385
we have a frequency omega.

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:20.711
A resonance frequency omega 0.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.350
And we measure line
with delta omega.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:32.380
In many cases, we will
discuss in great detail

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.369
the line shape is a Lorentzian.

01:08:35.369 --> 01:08:41.350
And the Lorentzian is the
imaginary part of the 1 over 6

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.990
function.

01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:46.510
Omega 0 minus omega.

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:49.120
And then there is
this parameter gamma.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.220
Gamma, which appears
in the Lorentzian,

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:05.319
is identical to the full
width at half maximum.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:10.304
And the Q factor of a Lorentzian
is omega 0 over gamma.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:25.170
Let me finish a few more minutes
with a short note about-- we've

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.770
talked about resonances.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.220
I've talked about now the
two important parameters.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.859
The resonance frequency and the
full widths at half maximum.

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:35.790
How do we measure those?

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:41.644
And there is actually
sometimes a confusion.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.340
The more systematic
approach is you

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.130
should measure all
those frequency and line

01:09:52.130 --> 01:10:02.170
width in angular
frequency units, which

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:07.570
are technically
radian per second.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:10.050
2 pi per second.

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:13.230
But since radian
has more dimension,

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:17.870
you sometimes say we measure
it in inverse seconds.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:25.340
So this is the measurement
angular frequencies.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.760
And this is different from
the unit of frequencies.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:37.730
When we have a frequency, which
is an angular frequency divided

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:47.090
by 2 pi, frequencies are
usually measured in hertz.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:52.530
The problem is that a hertz is
always also 1 over a second.

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:55.480
And this is where
the confusion comes.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:01.990
So then you just point out how
you can avoid the confusion.

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:06.280
You may right an angular
frequency or maybe a 0.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.800
It is 2 pie times 1 megahertz.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.940
Then you exactly
know what it is.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:21.180
Of course, this is nothing
else than six times 6.28 times

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.322
10 to the 6 second
to the minus 1.

01:11:26.322 --> 01:11:37.310
But you should never
say that omega 0 is

01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:42.720
6.8 times 10 to the 6
hertz because then people

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.010
don't really know
and you get confused

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:47.980
and you confuse other
people if you really

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:51.100
mean that this has a
frequency of 6 times

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.430
into the 6 hertz on
angular frequency.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:58.370
So just be clean in your
thinking and your homework

01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.390
and all that that
a frequency when

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:03.160
you mean angular frequency
is 1 over second,

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.570
when you mean it as a
frequency, it's hertz,

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.390
and this is often the
clearest form to say,

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:13.380
yes, I know where to put the two
pie and I put it in explicitly.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:19.000
So we often in our papers
report frequencies like that.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:36.424
Finally, there is the
question about gamma.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.750
So what are the units for gamma?

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:48.830
Well if you look at the
exponential which decays,

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:51.320
it has e to the minus i omega t.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.230
And then it has the
imaginary part, gamma t.

01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:59.620
So gamma is really
a temporal decay.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.120
And there is no question
about frequency and angular

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:02.620
frequency.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.850
It's not a frequency.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:05.100
It's not an angular frequency.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.640
It's a decay of it.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:15.930
So for instance, if gamma
is 10 to the 4 per second,

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:21.390
you should never say gamma
is 10 to the 4 hertz.

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:24.030
Or you should also
never say gamma

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:31.790
is 2 pi times 1.66 kilohertz.

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:34.840
That just doesn't
make any sense.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.496
Gamma is really
at a damping rate.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:38.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:38.412 --> 01:13:39.472
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:13:39.472 --> 01:13:40.430
I need one more minute.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.971
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:13:40.971 --> 01:13:45.280
PROFESSOR: And is there
for an inverse time.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.710
The damping time
associated with this camera

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:56.070
is simply the inverse of it and
in the case chosen its hundred

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:57.760
microsecond.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.490
So just keep that in mind.

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:02.490
Time is over.

01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:04.835
Any questions?

01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:06.110
OK, great.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:11.010
We meet again same place,
same time, on Monday.

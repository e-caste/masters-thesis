WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
OK, good morning all.
So before we begin,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I just thought I'd show you a
little news item that I happened

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to read that was very relevant
to what we covered recently in

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:32.000
So you recall when we did the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
digital section a few days ago
last Thursday,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we talked about a switch.
We talked about the MOSFET

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
switch, which when turned on and
off, by input signals could help

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
build gates which would then be
combined in tens of millions of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
quantities and go into chips
like the Pentium 4 and AMD

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Athlon 64, and so on it so
forth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I just saw this news item
that I came across,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and this says they are
rethinking the basic

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
construction of the products.
It talks about the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
semiconductor manufacturers like
AMD, Intel, and others that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
build digital chips.
They are rethinking the basic

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
construction of the products
down to the architecture of the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
transistor.
That's a MOS transistor,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the on/off switch inside
the chip.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
OK, now this might imply that
there is a single switch inside

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the chip, but no,
there's tens of millions of

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
transistors, or tens of millions
of switches inside a chip.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And pretty much any advancement
that can be made to the basic

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
transistor can have a 10 million
to 20 million times effect

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because there are that many of
them on a single chip.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So I thought that was very
appropriate.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
OK.
Let's dive into a quick review.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So this week,
we had begun nonlinear

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
analysis, and I just thought I'd
blast through a few animations

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that I've created,
trying to give you more insight

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
into the behavior of some of the
things that we have done.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now first of all,
as I did the last time,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
let me try to put it in
perspective most of what you've

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
learned thus far,
and what we will be learning

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
today.
So the past week,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we have been focusing on
nonlinear analysis.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And as I pointed out,
here is how this fits into the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
big picture.
So, we had our 6.002 world,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
at what we said is that we are
engineers.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We are going to devise our own
playground in which to play with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
our own rules.
And that's our playground.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That's what we're going to
learn about in 002,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and for that matter,
the rest of EECS at MIT.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's all within this playground
here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And this is the playground with
lumped circuit abstraction,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and good old KVL,
KCl, node method,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
your basic composition rules
apply within this playground

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that directly come from
Maxwell's equations because you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
have made the lumped matter
discipline assumptions.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
OK, so then we said a large
part of the playground is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
linear, and some other much more
intuitive techniques apply

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
within the linear portion of
that playground,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
techniques like the
superposition,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thevenin and Norton.
In most exercises,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and quizzes,
and experiments,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and so on that you do in real
life, you can pretty much apply

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
these simple techniques.
Very rarely do you have to go

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
into the node method for
circuits that are more

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
complicated than single source
and a couple of elements.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then, there's the nonlinear
part.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Remember, the reason I showed
this is that this is the same

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
playground.
OK, linear and nonlinear are

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
part of the same playground.
OK, even nonlinear elements are

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
lumped circuit elements,
and they follow KVL,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
KCl, the node equation,
and so on.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then, last week we spent
some time talking about the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
digital abstraction.
So we focused on a smaller

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
region of the playground.
And the assumptions we made in

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
there were even tighter.
We said that it is part of the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
playground we shall only deal
with binary values.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We'll digitize or lump values
into highs and lows,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and that's where our circuits
are going to be.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And these circuits,
when looked at as a whole,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
were nonlinear.
So, this is a simple NAND gate

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
circuit.
And this is the input/output

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
characteristic.
So, for example,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
if I hold B at zero,
and I apply a zero to one

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
transition at A,
then this is the output that I

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
will see at C.
So notice, this is decidedly

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
nonlinear.
Then I said that,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
look, suppose we had to fix the
input values at a given set.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
OK, so let's say,
for example,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I fix A at one,
and B at one.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
OK, and then look at the
circuit in this situation.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What do I find?
What I find is that the entire

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
digital set of circuits that we
were looking at move over into

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the linear space for a given set
of switch settings,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
OK?
So, when I set A 1 and B 1,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
A equal to one and B equal to
one, my NAND gate becomes like

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
this.
OK, it's a simple resistive

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
network with a voltage source,
VS.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So, for a fixed set of inputs,
for a given set of inputs,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
if I don't change my inputs,
then my circuit looks like a

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
linear circuit,
and my good old linear analysis

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
techniques apply.
So that was last week.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And this week,
we are looking at the nonlinear

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
space.
And we looked at a couple of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
techniques in the nonlinear
space, analytical techniques and

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
graphical techniques.
And then, I showed you an

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
example.
OK, I showed you an example

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
circuit that was something that
I would like to build involving

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the light emitting expo dweeb,
my little garage door opener

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
thingamajig, and I wanted to
transmit music over that light

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
beam.
I also showed you that it was

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
highly distorted because it was
in the nonlinear space.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So, today what I'm going to do
is introduce a new part of the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
playground.
There's a new part of the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
playground, and I'll show you a
technique whereby by focusing on

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
this part of the playground and
disciplining ourselves in the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
kind of inputs we apply to
circuits, I'm going to show you

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that certain kinds of nonlinear
circuits also move over,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
when used in a particular way,
also move into the linear

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
analysis domain.
OK, so let me leave that for

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
now and go back into quickly
reviewing the motivating example

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of music that I had taken last
time.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
OK, so here was a little
example.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So I have a music source,
VI, and I apply that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This device that I call the,
lightheartedly,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the Light Emitting Expo Dweeb
has a current,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
VD, across it,
or a voltage,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
VD, across it,
and a current ID through it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And the light intensity,
I said, was proportional to the

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
current.
And because of that,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I was able to get the light to
impinge on a receiving device,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
which produced a current that
was proportional to the

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
intensity of light falling on
it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And that signal would then be
amplified somehow.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We haven't talked about all of
this stuff yet.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This will happen next week.
But let's say we somehow

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
amplify the signal and then
played out through a set of

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
speakers.
All right, so if I had some

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
sort of a music signal here,
then I could then transmit the

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
music signal over to the side on
top of this light beam.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But the problem,
as I said the last time,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
was that our device,
the Light Emitting Expo Dweeb

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
had an exponential
characteristic,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
so that I had some trouble in
getting undistorted music.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, the characteristic of the
VI characteristics of my device

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
looked like so.
The ID versus VD curve looked

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
as follows.
OK, it was decidedly nonlinear.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And because of that,
I was getting a lot of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
distortions in my signal,
and I showed you a little trick

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to plot, given an input waveform
at a transfer function such as

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
here to plot the output
function.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
OK, let me show you another
little animation that I have

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
created here for you that should
give you even more intuition in

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
terms of how it happens.
So, this is a characteristic I

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
showed you up here.
It's on both sides,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but I guess it points to only
one unless I shuttle back and

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
forth really fast.
So on average,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I'll be in both places.
But anyway, so here's my ID

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
versus VD characteristic.
And as I said,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
there's an exponential ID
versus VD curve.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And I want to see what the
output looks like,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for example,
a sinusoidal input.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So I said, let's place the
input along a little graph,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
rotate it so,
and take a sinusoid,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and apply a sinusoid to the
input, VI, which would also

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
appear across the Light Emitting
Expo Dweeb.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And then, what I wanted to see
was how the output looked.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
OK, so let me tell you that the
output is going to look like

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
this.
OK, the output is going to look

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
like so.
And, a little artifice to

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
discover curves like this is to
think about a point here

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
corresponding to the point on
the transfer curve here,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
because this is VD,
looking at the Y intercept.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
That's a value of ID,
and that's a value of ID here.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And, time moves along here,
and time moves along here.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So, I did this little
animation.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You'd better be impressed.
It took me six hours to do it.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, here it goes.
So, let's say I start by

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
focusing on this little point
that corresponds to this point

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
on the transfer function,
which then, in turn,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
points to a time,
zero, this point on my ID

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
curve.
OK, I hope this works.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So, as my point moves down
[LAUGHTER], this was fun to do,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I promise you.
So notice that as this point

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
has the following excursion,
this had the following

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
excursions here.
OK, all right.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So let me pause that little
animation there.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
At the end of the lecture,
I'll put that up again if you

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
like, and you all can come and
play with it.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So, you can actually do this in
PowerPoint.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It took me quite a bit of time
to figure out how to do it,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
though, but it's fun.
OK, so let me show you a little

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
demo, and show you a sinusoid,
and show you what the output

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
looks like if I apply a sinusoid
for VI.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So, I'll show you ID as a
function of VI when VI is a

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
sinusoid.
There you go.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So, I applied my sinusoid VI,
and this is the current that I

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
get.
And notice, this is the

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
transfer function that I talked
about, the ID versus VD curve of

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
my Light Emitting Expo Dweeb.
And I get this highly nonlinear

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000
transformation of the input as I
get to the output.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
OK, so that is a problem.
And then, I also played some

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
music for you.
Let's do that,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
too.
I played some music for you.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I applied the music as an input
to the circuit,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and that's the output.
OK, that's the output that I'm

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
observing at the amplifier.
It's highly distorted.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
OK, we can stop that.
There you go.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
OK, so that was my problem.
OK, so we had covered,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
we had gone this far last
Tuesday.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I set the problem up for you,
motivated what we had to do,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and showed you that I was able
to transmit music over my garage

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
door opener, but I did not think
I could listen to that music for

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
very long.
So, I challenged all of us to

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
think about how a trick that I
could use to be able to transmit

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
music and have a linear
response.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, did you people get time to
think about it?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So how many people here think
they know the answer?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
It's OK, don't be modest.
Go ahead.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Could you speak louder?
Yeah, you find another

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
something, kind of element,
that's got the opposite graph

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
so that when you add them
together.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Oh, this guy wants to cheat.
No.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
He wants a new element.
So, no, no new elements.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Pardon?
Build an MP3 encoder.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Ah-ha, so that will happen much
later.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Yes?
Digitize the signal before you

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
send it to the LED?
Digitize the signal before you

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
send it to the LED.
But in some sense,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
each of these solutions is a
huge sledgehammer approach to

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
look at solving it.
There's a much simpler

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
technique I can apply here.
Yeah?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Add a voltage offset.
Ah, ah-ha, that might work.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
What else?
So let's say,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
here's my signal,
right?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
If I add a voltage offset,
that will just bump the signal

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
up here.
Then the curve is still

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
nonlinear.
But you're getting there.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's pause here.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Let me quit while I'm ahead.
OK, so the answer here,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
folks, is Zen.
OK, what I want you to do is,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
so, in Zen, what you have to do
is you have to sit down in a

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
courtyard, and look at a rock,
like a small rock on the

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
ground.
And you got a focus on it till

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
the rest of Earth kind of
vanishes.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Just focus on the rock.
OK, now make like you're in a

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
courtyard, and you're looking at
this little area here.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Just look at this.
OK, and I'll give you ten

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
seconds.
Sit down quietly,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and no sounds.
Just stare at the spot here.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
OK, make believe this is your
little rock, and just stand

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
there and think about it.
OK, I'll give you five seconds

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
to do that.
Just stare at it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And very soon,
the answer should pop into your

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
heads.
OK, what do you see?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
This guy, if I focus on this
really small region of the

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
graph, this small little piece
looks more or less linear.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
OK, hmm, so that should give me
some insight.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
This whole thing,
the macrograph is nonlinear.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But I focus on a little rinky
dinky piece of that graph like

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
so, that appears more or less
linear.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
If it's small enough,
that appears linear.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So, I'm staring at this,
and that appears linear.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
The question is,
how do I exploit this little

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
small, little,
linear region to get a linear

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
response from my device.
OK, so here's the trick that

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I'm going to use.
The little trick that I'm going

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to use is the following.
Notice that,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
let me call this voltage at the
center of this region capital

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
VD.
What I can do,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
if I take my input signal,
and I just pointed out earlier,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I bump it up.
I boost it.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
OK, so I apply a DC offset to
my input signal,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
like so.
So I apply some input signal,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
VI, which is also equal to the
VD if I look at a variable

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
across the nonlinear element.
If I apply a DC offset,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
VI, and I superimpose the music
on top of that,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
let me call my music,
just to distinguish between the

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
two, capital VI,
and the small vi.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
OK, that's my music.
So here's my capital VD,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
my DC offset.
And I want to superimpose my

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
music on top of that.
OK, so I've gotten halfway

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
there.
By superimposing my music here

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
instead of having excursions out
here, I now have excursions out

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
here.
OK, and so I'm using some

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
portion of the graph here.
But that's still way beyond the

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
small little element there.
So a second think that I do in

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
addition to boosting up the
signal is shrink it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Think of boost and shrink,
BS.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So what I want to do is boost
up the signal using a DC offset,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and shrink the sucker.
OK, so I'm going to go with a

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
small signal and bump it up.
OK, so now what happens is that

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
small signal in its excursions,
only uses that little portion

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
of the graph.
OK, again, remember:

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
bump and shrink,
bump and shrink,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000
two things, boost and shrink.
So what do you think of that

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
trick?
So, by doing that,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
what happens is that signal
that has excursions here will

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
produce a corresponding response
in this region,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
OK?
And I argue that since this is

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
more or less like a straight
line, I invoke Zen here,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and argue that this little
signal now gets transformed,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and I get a linear response.
OK: boost and shrink.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So in terms of my circuit,
let me draw it out for you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
My Light Emitting Expo Dweeb,
and this whole signal was what

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I used to call V capital I,
and that's made up of two

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
components now,
a bump offset,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and a shrunk voltage VI.
It shrunk, so therefore I've

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
used the small v and small i,
like, really,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
really small.
In the same manner,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I get a VD ID across the LED,
and the corresponding values

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
here will also have a DC offset
and a small response.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Let me call that ID plus I
small d.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I'll do all this mathematically
in a second as well,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
but first let me do it
completely intuitively so you

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
get some insight into what's
going on.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And, VD is simply capital VD
plus small vd.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
OK, and this is the same as VI,
I, and VI.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
OK, so what have I done?
I've done two things.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I have said,
as an engineer,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
OK, I care about getting music
across my garage door opener.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And I'll do what it takes to do
that.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
OK, so as an engineer,
I'll do two things.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I'm going to bump my signal up
and shrink it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And the bumping and shrinking,
and I do it like this.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I shrink my signal,
the music signal here,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and add a DC offset.
OK, and I claim that the music

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I listened on the other side
now, provided I have enough

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
amplification there,
is going to be undistorted.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
OK, so far I've showing this to
you completely intuitively using

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
little sketches,
no math.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I promise you,
I'll give you a bunch of math

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
in a few seconds,
but just get the basic idea,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and get the intuition behind
it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
So let's go back to our demo
and take a look.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So remember,
BS, right, bump and shrink.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So what I'm going to do is
first of all,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
let me bump up the signal.
So, what I'll do is I want to

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
add an offset to my input,
and let me bump it up.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Let me shrink it first.
It'll make the point a little

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
clearer.
So, the big input,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
green, is a big input.
Let me shrink it.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
OK, so I've made my input
small, and in the middle of that

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
picture out there,
you see the region of the

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
transfer curve that's being
articulated.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
OK, this region of the curve is
being articulated by the small

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
signal.
It's a much smaller signal.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And the output is still
distorted because I have to do

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
two things: bump and shrink.
I've only shrunk.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
OK, let me bump it up now.
What's the yellow curve?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
It's going to get linear.
It's going to get proportional

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
to the input.
Then I'm bumping it up now.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I can make it smaller,
make it even smaller,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
there you go.
Isn't that fantastic?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
So, I'm making nature do my
bidding here,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
OK?
So, this is one of those,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
when I learned electronics and
so on many, many years ago,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
this was one of those really
big ah-ha moments for me,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
saying, wow,
that stuff is cool.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
It's something that I couldn't
think about myself,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
and it's not obvious,
and by being disciplined and

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
creative in how I use circuits,
I can do really,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
really cool things.
OK, remember this as a big

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
ah-ha moment for you.
So, here's my little signal

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
that I've shrunk and bumped up,
and my output is a sinusoid,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
and not this funny,
distorted waveform.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And notice that this is the
region of the curve that is

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
being articulated.
So, I can make the signal even

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
smaller if I like.
OK, and what I'd like to do

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
next is play music for you,
and if you don't believe your

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
eyes, you can at least believe
your ears.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Let me go to the distorted
signal again,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
switch to music,
and raise it up.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
OK, now what we'll do is shrink
the music signal and then bump

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
it up.
Can I turn the volume down a

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
little bit?
That's good.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
OK, so if I shrunk the volume a
little bit, and let me bump it

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
up, now.
[MUSIC PLAYS] Just remember

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
this as a big ah-ha moment.
OK, the signal is really,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
really small.
I like that.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I like the enthusiasm.
OK, so the signal's very small,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
and I get a more or less linear
response.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
OK.
All right, so that's intuition,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
and the approach that I've
taken is called,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
it's variously called small
signal analysis,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
incremental analysis,
small signal method,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
small signal discipline,
whatever you want.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
OK, this simply says that by
boosting and shrinking my

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
signal, I get a response that's
more or less linear even when I

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
have a nonlinear device.
And this technique is called

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
the small signal approach.
So, just to focus on that a

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
little bit longer,
switch to page five of your

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
notes and let me draw something
out for you.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
OK, so what I have here,
this is my offset VD,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
and from the VD offset I have
my little signal V small d,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
and the total signal is called
V capital D.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Offset, small signal,
and that's my total signal.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
OK, notice the offset is all
capital.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
The total signal is small v
capital D, and the music or the

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
small signal is small v small d.
Similarly, the output is going

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
to look like this,
and here I get an offset in the

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
output ID.
I get a corresponding signal,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I small d, and I get a total
signal, I capital D,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
OK?
The cool thing to notice is

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
that the signal here,
the output signal here

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
corresponding to the input
signal, the music signal,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
VD, is small I small D,
and that is more or less

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
linear.
OK, and I can even plot the

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000
signal like so.
This is my input,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
v capital D.
That's T.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:26.000
This is VD, V small d.
That is my total input.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And similarly,
I have an output.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And this is my output ID.
And, that looks like this,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I capital D,
small i small d,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000
total signal I capital D.
OK, so that's the small signal

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
method.
So, let me summarize that for

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
you.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
There are three steps to the
method.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
So, first of all,
operate at some DC offset.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
This is also called DC bias,
and in that example it's VDID.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
OK, so I choose an operating
point that bumps up the

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
operation in some region of
interest.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
The second step is to
superimpose small signal on top

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
of VD, capital V capital D,
to superimpose a small signal,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
and the third step is observe
the response --

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
-- and the response,
small i small d,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
that's the music part of the
response, ID,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000
is approximately linear.
OK, three steps to the method

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:32.000
here, and just remember this
notation.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And, my notation in the small
signal model is as follows.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000
My total signal ID is the sum
of two signals,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I capital D plus small i small
d.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
This is called the total
signal.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:03.000
That's called the DC offset.
And this is the superimposed

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
small signal.
OK, total signal,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
DC offset, plus the small
signal.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And sometimes,
especially when doing math,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
and so on, we may oftentimes
represent ID as a delta,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I capital D,
OK, to show that ID is

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000
incremental change in the value
of I capital D.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And because of that,
this method is also often

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
called the incremental method,
incremental analysis.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
OK, so far what I've done is
given you some intuition.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I've developed a small,
simple method,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
given you some insight into why
we use this method,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
and also shown you some
demonstrations that show that

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
when I bump and shrink,
and observe the response,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I do get a more or less linear
response.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So let me now do this
mathematically and show you that

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
mathematically,
you can also derive your

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
response to be a linear
response.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
This is page seven.
So, I know that ID is some

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.000
function of the diode voltage.
F was my nonlinear function.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
OK, so my function F was a
nonlinear function.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
So therefore,
ID was nonlinearly related to

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
VD.
So, let's do the math.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
So as a first step,
what we did was replace VD by a

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
DC offset, the small signal
method, a DC offset,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
plus a small incremental
change.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
OK, by doing the math,
let me simply use the delta VD

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
notation to show you that I'm
dealing with small increments,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
and also because in the
mathematics community,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
when you learn about some of
these techniques,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
they will use the incremental
change notation,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
which is the delta VD notation.
In electrical engineering,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
we use a small v,
small d notation.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So, this is a large DC offset,
and this is a small change

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
about that offset.
So, you folks have taken math

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
courses before,
and been looking at finding out

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
the value of a function,
which is a small change for an

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
input value, which is a small
change about a big input value

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
or a big DC point is Taylor's
expansion.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
OK, so let's use Taylor's
series expansion,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
OK, and substitute VD plus
delta VD into this,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
and see what ID looks like.
Again, let me tell you where

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I'm going with this.
ID equals F of VD.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
This is a nonlinear function,
OK?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
I claim that by replacing VD,
the input, with the DC offset

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
plus a small value,
the resulting response to the

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
small value will be linear,
OK?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So what I'm going to do next is
replace VD with this sum here,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
and then do the math,
and show you that the response

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
corresponding,
or the change in ID

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
corresponding to the change in
VD is going to be linear.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
All right, so let's expand this
function using Taylor's series

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
near the DC offset point,
capital V capital D.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
OK, so ID is simply,
by Taylor's series,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I want to find out a value of
the function close to V capital

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
D.
OK, so I take the value of the

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
function at that point,
and then I add a few terms in

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
my Taylor's series expansion.
The first term is simply the

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000
good old Taylor's series stuff.
OK, the first term is the first

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
derivative of the function times
the change.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000
And then, the second one is
second derivative.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
OK, and then I get higher order
terms.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
So this is nothing new here.
This is good old Taylor series

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
expansion, and again,
let me tell you where I'm

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
going.
I want to look at the response

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
for an input that looks like
this, and I want to show you at

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
the end of the day that the
response in ID,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
the effect on ID of using an
input like this is as if that

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
effect, the incremental change
is linearly related to the small

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
input, delta VD.
So here's my Taylor's series

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
expansion for delta V.
Now remember,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I told you that delta VD is
much, much smaller than V

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
capital D.
OK, it's a very,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
very small quantity.
But that quantity is really

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
very small.
Then what I'm going to get is

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
that my output is,
I can begin to ignore my second

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
order terms.
OK, delta VD is very,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
very, very small.
Then, what I'm going to do is

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
that ignore higher order terms.
So I'll go and ignore higher

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
order terms.
They'll all go to zero.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Remember, I can do this because
by design I've chosen delta VD

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
to be very, very,
very small.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
OK, remember,
we are engineers.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I've chosen it in a way that
this is very small.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
OK, so I'm telling you that's
the case, and under those

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
conditions, I can ignore second
higher order terms,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
in which case I am left with
this expression here.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
So let me rewrite this.
Let me rewrite this down here.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
OK, I've just copied this
turnout, I've ignored all these

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
terms here, and so I have a more
or less equal to sign that

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
remains.
So what I'm going to do is when

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
I apply a small input of this
form to a large DC offset,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
my output is also going to look
like some output offset with a

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000
change in the output offset.
And let me call the output

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
offset I capital D,
and some small change in the

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
output delta ID.
OK, we'll make sure we can

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
convince ourselves that this is
indeed the case.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Notice that this guy here,
F of capital V capital D is a

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000
constant.
That's a constant with respect

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
to the incremental change,
delta VD.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Similarly, this part here is a
constant.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Notice that this term here is
the first derivative of the

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:41.000
function evaluated at the DC
bias point, capital V capital D.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
OK, so this term is also a
constant with respect to delta

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
VD.
So notice, then,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I have a constant term plus a
constant term multiplying a

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
small change,
delta VD.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So what I can do next is,
in this case,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
given that I have a constant
term on both sides,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
and on this side it's a time
varying term,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
what I can do is equate the two
constant terms.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
I can go ahead and equate these
two terms.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Remember, I have a constant
plus a time varying term,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
OK, if I'm assuming here that
delta VD, my little music signal

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
is a time varying term.
So, this constant will equal

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
this, so ID must equal F of VD.
And I know that's the case

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
because the function evaluated
at the DC offset gives me the DC

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
current ID.
And similarly,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000
ID is equal to that component.
Delta ID is equal to D,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
F of --

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
OK, so my incremental change in
the output is the first

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
derivative multiplied by the
small change in the current.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
OK, so I'm pretty much done.
So, therefore,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
notice that delta ID is
proportional to delta VD.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
OK, and that's what I had set
out to show.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Remember, I had set out to show
that provided my input is a

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
small excursion around a large
DC offset,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
then my output could also be a
large DC offset with a small

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
excursion on top of it where the
two excursions,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
the input excursion and the
output excursion would be

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
linearly related like so.
OK, and the method is very

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
simple.
I simply expanded the function

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
about that point,
that DC point,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
neglected higher order terms,
and notice that my incremental

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
term was simply the derivative
plus the incremental change,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
a derivative times the
incremental change in the input.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Move onto page nine,
and I'd like to give you a

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
quick graphical interpretation
of this.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
So I gave an intuitive
explanation earlier.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
This is a mathematical
explanation that shows you that

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
the input could be linearly
related to the output,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
provided, the outputs would be
linearly related to the input,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
provided the input has a DC
offset, and small excursions

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
about that DC offset.
So, let me give you some

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000
intuition in what you've really
done here, using a little graph

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
here.
So, I'm going to plot ID versus

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
VD, and notice that I have some
point here, V capital D,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I capital D.
That's my DC bias.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
So, I have some DC bias point
here.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
OK, what is this?
That is simply the slope of the

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
curve at that point.
OK, it's the slope of this

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000
curve evaluated at this point.
So this guy here is simply the

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
slope of this curve evaluated at
ID VD.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
OK, now, what I care about is
this point here,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:50.000
and this point here.
So let's say that this is delta

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000
VD, all right,
and that corresponds to this

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
point here.
So what I've done is taken the

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
slope and multiplied that by
delta VD.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
So I've taken the slope,
and multiplied it by delta VD,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
OK, and that gives me this
component here.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
OK, and so, this is the point
that I'm going to get.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
So in other words,
what I've done is approximated

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
point A using the Taylor trick
by the point B.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
OK, so this is a point,
A, which is what I really want,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
and I've approximated that by
taking the slope of the function

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
at V capital D,
and multiplying that by the

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
change in the input to get the
corresponding Y offset,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
and that's the point that I
get.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And notice that if I make this
delta VD small enough,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
then the error between these
two points becomes smaller and

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
smaller.
So back to our example,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
so ID was a e to the BVD.
This was the relation for our

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Expo Dweeb, and let me just plug
in the values.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So, ID plus small id.
Notice, I'm just shuttling back

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.000
and forth between the notation
delta VD, and small v small d.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000
OK, and so that is given by a e
to the BVD, oops,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:59.000
plus, I'm just writing that
equation up there.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Let me call this equation X.
And so, I get the second term

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
is the derivative,
ab times e to the BVD times

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
delta VD, small VD,
and equating this term that the

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
DC offset.
Notice that this is the DC

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
offset in the output,
and the small signal,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
ID is, further notice that in
this particular example,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
what's that?
a e to the BVD.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:45.000
That's simply ID again.
It just happens to be that way

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
in this example.
So, I get ID times BVD.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
So, for my input,
small id, my incremental change

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000
in the output is some ID times B
times VD.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And notice that this is a
constant.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.000
And because that is a constant,
my small signal behavior ID is

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
going to be linearly related to
the signal, VD,

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
the input signal VD.
OK, in the last three minutes,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I'd like to give you one
additional insight.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
So what we've shown so far is
if I have an offset and a small

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
change above it,
then my output ID will be

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
linearly related to my input.
Now let's stare at this thing

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
again.
Let me rewrite it.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
It's some constant IDB times
VD.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
So, where have we seen such an
expression before?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
OK, where ID was some constant
times VD.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
OK, remember,
I equals V divided by R:

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Ohm's law.
What I want to show you now is

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
how we constantly keep
simplifying our lives.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
The moment we hit some
complication and things get too

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
painful to analyze,
as engineers,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
we come up with some clever
tricks to make an analysis and

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
use of circuits simple again.
And so, notice that this is

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
similar to some,
one by RD VD,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.000
where RD is simply one over
IDB.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
I'm just defining this to be
RD.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:59.000
And what that means is that I
can take a nonlinear circuit

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000
that looks like this.
OK, and what I can do is

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
replace this by its incremental
equivalent, and build what is

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
called a small signal circuit.
And I'll just introduce it

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
here.
And we will revisit the circuit

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
in much more gory detail a
couple of weeks from now.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
So, what I can do is build a
small signal circuit where I

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
have all the small signal
variables, and replace a

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000
nonlinear device by a simple
little resistor whose value is

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
given by IDB.
OK, so therefore,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
what I can do is take my
nonlinear circuit,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
and for small,
incremental changes,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000
replace that circuit with this
equivalent small signal circuit,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
and go back to doing simple
stuff again.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Thank you.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.410
GARY GENSLER: So
payments part two

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
we're going to chat a little
bit about the overview today.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.130
Readings, of course
as we always do.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.830
And then what was yesterday?

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.900
Does anybody want to tell
me what yesterday was?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.206
Kelly?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.580
AUDIENCE: The 10th anniversary.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.330
GARY GENSLER: 10th
anniversary of bitcoin.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.760
What else was yesterday?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.470
It was Halloween.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.780
No, it is not my birthday again.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.910
Stop that, Tom.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.190
So we're going to
chat a little bit,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.800
we're going to have some
fun about happy anniversary

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000
or birthday.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.390
Would you call it a
birthday or anniversary?

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.360
Anniversary?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.570
OK.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.580
Birthday, all right.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.770
There's no established
vocabulary really

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.440
in this field.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.062
So--

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:12.210
AUDIENCE: Birthday
comes in January.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.988
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:14.780
AUDIENCE: Birthday
comes in January.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.947
GARY GENSLER: The birthday--

00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:17.720
Hugo, why's the birthday
come in January?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.510
AUDIENCE: Birthday
marks [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.920
So the music is [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.204
GARY GENSLER: Riham?

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:27.186
AUDIENCE: Birth means death
at a point in time in my mind,

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:31.460
so anniversary
[INAUDIBLE] is better.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.630
GARY GENSLER: You got--

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.580
did you get that?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.500
Birth also connotes death.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.480
Did I have that?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.980
And so Rahim was saying she
would go with anniversary.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.390
But we have birth over here.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.330
We're going to chat a little
bit about that and try--

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.990
the existential.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.670
Then we're going to talk about
payment systems and the sort

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.250
of some of the pain points.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.235
And we'll have a
lively discussion.

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:01.610
What do you think
the pain points

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.580
are in the payment system?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.360
I, of course, will
have listed some,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.150
but your input's
the most important.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.240
How does blockchain fit
into this payment system,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.560
and why so far haven't there
been any really economy-wide

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.180
or system-wide adoptions yet?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.680
So one might even say what are
the pain points of blockchain

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.140
technology that
there has not yet

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.480
been some of those adoptions?

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.530
We're going to chat a little bit
about some blockchain payment

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.140
companies, and
there are not many.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.000
I mean, there are
many white papers

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.370
but there are not many that
have actually taken off.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220
And then wrap it up.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.540
So the study
questions which we're

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.010
going to sort of dig into
rather than right now

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.400
but just what
lessons can be taken.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.272
So for my layer two help us.

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:59.480
We're going to come back to
these when we sort of dig

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.970
into the paint points.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.000
What are the opportunities
in cross-border and so forth,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.830
and the trade offs
of using permissioned

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.230
versus permissionless systems.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.250
So happy anniversary,
happy birthday

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.030
for some, 10 years ago.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.900
It's remarkable.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.680
Actually, some people say it
was November 1st because I think

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590
when it actually got on
the website it was November

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.790
1st in parts of the world.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.090
So what do we know about
the 10th anniversary?

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.440
Just some fun statistics.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.760
This has all
happened in 10 years.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
So the price is around
$6,300 to Bitcoin out

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.950
of nothing, Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.955
And it's $110 billion in size.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.040
We might not all know
each other in 10 years,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.600
but write down for yourself
on a piece of paper--

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.710
this is a real exercise I'm
asking you to do for yourself.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.950
Write down for yourself
and put this piece of paper

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.720
somewhere or put
it on your laptop.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.240
You can put it down, where do
you think the price of Bitcoin

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.890
will be 10 years from today
on the 20th anniversary?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.080
And remember this
course in 10 years,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.590
and look back, and
laugh at yourself.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.930
Just we won't all
know each other.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.490
Maybe there'll be
a group chat, but--

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.242
what's that Alit?

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:20.950
You don't want to
guess where it is-- you

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.120
don't need to share it with me.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.350
No, no, but write down
and think about it.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.560
Where do you think this
will be in 10 years?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.488
Is this a hard question?

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.918
Alpha, do you want to share
your number with the class?

00:04:37.918 --> 00:04:39.960
AUDIENCE: We're even just
debating directionally,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.410
it's really going to
be higher or lower.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.660
GARY GENSLER: Well,
how many people

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.710
think it'll be
lower in 10 years?

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.760
OK, I'd say it's about 30%, 35%.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.310
How many higher?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.190
Yeah, that's 60%, 65%.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.720
Alin, you-- you did
two Alin split, right?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.280
AUDIENCE: Think
it's going to be 0.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.030
GARY GENSLER: I think
that would be lower.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.260
AUDIENCE: It is,
because in 10 years

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.940
the system might
change so dramatically

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.347
it might be unfair to
even call it bitcoin.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:11.430
GARY GENSLER: Fair enough.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.340
It might have evolved
into something else.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.195
Back here please.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:19.570
AUDIENCE: I just
want to comment.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.260
Isn't the real
question market cap,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.720
because that's what people are
actually using the currency

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.440
for?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.607
Because the question of
what's the price going to be

00:05:26.607 --> 00:05:30.080
presupposes a set number of
shares of coins or tokens.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.450
So the way that people are
mining coins in the future also

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.820
depends on the price.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.420
GARY GENSLER: So I think you
raise a really good question.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.490
If you're writing
something down you

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.800
could write down the market
cap rather than the price.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.610
You could say--

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.510
I mean, in the Leeds case you
would still say 0 for both,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.400
but you might say
that-- of course.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.410
Because it depends
on how many coins

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.470
there are, how many
shares there are.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.830
Does anybody want to take
the other side from this--

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.770
the other Alin?

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.660
AUDIENCE: I think
it'll have zeros--

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.383
it'll have zeros in the price.

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:01.300
GARY GENSLER: It will
have zeros in the price.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.820
Hugo?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.320
AUDIENCE: Well, I just want to
respond to the other comment.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.278
Do you know exactly how
many bitcoin there will

00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:07.580
be in about 10 years from now?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.913
GARY GENSLER: Do we actually
know how many bitcoin there

00:06:09.913 --> 00:06:10.797
will be in 10 years?

00:06:10.797 --> 00:06:11.380
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.610
GARY GENSLER: Hugo says
you do because it's

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.290
written in the code.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.790
Remind me your first name?

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.410
Isaac.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.398
AUDIENCE: So I
think one is mining.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:24.940
I know that some folks may have
a better technical background

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.380
on mining and the way
you dedicate resources

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.370
based on price.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.540
But I'm seeing a shake-up
ahead, so maybe not.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.310
The other piece of
it, I think, is just

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.470
thinking about the flow.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.220
Thinking about the
bitcoin that's actually

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.960
being traded or transacted.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.020
If there's a
restricted market cap,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.140
it's similar to looking at big
cap stocks trading in China.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.057
You know, you don't
actually get a real price.

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.682
GARY GENSLER: While
I agree with those,

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:49.690
there's one other reason
we might not know the--

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.405
AUDIENCE: People
could stop mining.

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:53.030
GARY GENSLER: People
could stop mining.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.280
AUDIENCE: In five
years if it's zero.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.690
GARY GENSLER: Oh, that's if
it really just dwindles out.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.660
Nobody wants to expand.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.490
But what's one other
reason why it could

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.610
be a different number that--

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.235
Shimon?

00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:04.860
AUDIENCE: Fork.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.600
GARY GENSLER: A fork.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.980
There could be a consensus
amongst 51% of the parties

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:17.070
on this node to change the
what I'll call monetary policy.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.650
We've seen that
twice in Ethereum.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.080
Ethereum was having a certain
mining or block reward.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.620
They cut it in half once--
or they cut it from 5 to 3,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.720
and I think now they're
going from 3 to 2.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.410
It was not in the
original Ethereum.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.990
So there could be a consensus.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.990
It's not written
about a lot, but it

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.610
could be either
what's called a fork

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.660
or it could be so almost
unanimous that everybody

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.303
went for a change in
the monetary policy.

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:50.220
All right, so that's
just a little bit of fun.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.680
Some other quick
numbers and facts.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.840
There's 17.3 million
coins right now.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.260
So 17 million coins
have been mined so far,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.210
550,000 blocks roughly.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.410
189 gigs.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.280
Transactions per day, quarter
of a million transactions.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.680
And then if I've got
my decimals right,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.800
the hash rate is 10
to the 18th times 50.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.630
That's seven
trillion times harder

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.650
than when it was in 2009.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:33.130
There's seven trillion more
computational power in Bitcoin

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.669
now than there was
nine or 10 years ago.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:42.830
It takes about 1/3 of 1%
of the world's electricity,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.680
and there were some
nice comments overnight

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.770
in the discussion
for this class about

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.420
whether that's a
good thing or not.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.980
And maybe it's not a good thing.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.860
So that's Bitcoin anniversary.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.770
A couple other things,
unique addresses.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.850
There's a little bit over
500,000 unique addresses--

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.130
Bitcoin addresses.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.280
So if there's tens
of millions of people

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.040
that have Bitcoin and only half
a million Bitcoin addresses,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.370
what does it mean about the
probably 20 or 30 million

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.280
people that believe they
own Bitcoin but don't

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.390
have a Bitcoin address?

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.265
Where do they own it?

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.358
James?

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:22.400
AUDIENCE: In an exchange?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.858
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
on an exchange.

00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:26.180
Or in some custodial--

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.150
in essence relying
on somebody else

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.310
if there's a half a
million unique addresses,

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.805
but it's thought there's
20 to 30 million accounts.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.510
10,000 nodes.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.650
And bitnodes is a
website where you

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.090
can see where the nodes are.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.310
And it's concentration of
where the actual nodes are.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.760
So pretty spread around.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.060
There's not any alpha
in Ethiopia yet.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.350
In fact, I don't see--

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.850
what's that?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.824
Do you see two in Kenya?

00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:09.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's
two little dots.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.888
GARY GENSLER: Anybody
from Greenland?

00:10:11.888 --> 00:10:13.340
No.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.380
And of course, it's
spurred this whole thing--

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.700
we've seen this map before,
but initial coin offerings.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.035
$28 billion roughly raised.

00:10:22.035 --> 00:10:23.910
Again, we don't know if
the numbers are right

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.795
but this is what this 10
year anniversary or 10

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:27.920
years since it all started.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.390
This means there's
a lot of capital

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.150
chasing this field right now.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.900
So anybody want to
write down whether they

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.840
think ICOs are still going
to be around in 10 years?

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.110
How many people think initial
coin offerings will be around?

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.820
About half.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.260
And so the other-- oh,
I know where Alin is,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.970
but where are the rest of you?

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.890
I don't actually know.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.348
I think they're
going to slow down.

00:10:57.348 --> 00:10:59.860
I think in 2019 and
2020 they'll slow down

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.400
because so many
will have failed,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.207
the market will sort
of adjust and say,

00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:07.540
well, we're not going to
invest in these unless there is

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.640
a much better business model.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.280
And so it's spurred, this is
just a bucket of other coins.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.000
There's 1,600 odd coins,
probably 1,500 plus of them

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.400
will fail or maybe all 1,600.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.310
But 1,500 plus
will probably fail.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.690
I might be done with--
oh yeah, crypto finance.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.290
Actually there's not as much
volatility as there once was.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.190
We're slowly getting
a more stable coin.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.550
It doesn't mean it
will stay this way,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.660
but to the extent that
Bitcoin stabilizes in pricing

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.690
and stabilizes for
a long period there

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.510
might be a little
bit more use of it.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.860
But I wouldn't read--

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.350
six months does not
make enough history

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.210
to say that the volatility's
out of this thing.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.870
All right, so let's go
back to payment systems.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.568
So now I'm going to ask,
what are the pain points?

00:12:02.568 --> 00:12:04.610
I mean, maybe just putting
up the chart tells you

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.068
where the pain
points are, but this

00:12:06.068 --> 00:12:08.600
is the chart we talked
about Tuesday as to what

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.990
some of the challenges are.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.920
Anybody want to give me
some thoughts on this--

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.350
this was a consumer on
one end and a consumer

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.450
on the other end, it
happens to be a US model.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.940
But it's not that different
in most countries.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.260
But what pain points could
blockchain help address

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.000
in this complex system?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.530
So pain points.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.270
Anybody want to give me--

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.810
Brodish.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.890
AUDIENCE: There are
too many intermediaries

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.750
in the system, which means
that too many parallel ledgers.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.070
GARY GENSLER: So
multiple intermediaries

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.020
with parallel ledgers.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.377
What else?

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:50.710
AUDIENCE: I guess the usual
suspect would be high costs.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.200
GARY GENSLER: So high
cost, usual suspect.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.720
World Bank estimates it's
between a half a percent

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.840
and 1% of world
GDP, which would be,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.230
I guess, about $400 to
$800 billion a year.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.230
Zan?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.910
AUDIENCE: Speed of execution.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.357
GARY GENSLER:
Speed of execution.

00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:09.940
So what do you mean
when you say speed

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.890
of execution and payments?

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.230
AUDIENCE: I guess the
ability for a counterparty

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.130
to receive the money
and be able to spend it.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.310
GARY GENSLER: So the
final settlement--

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.350
sometimes it's
authorization, clearing,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.500
settlement-- but
final settlement

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.405
often doesn't occur
for a couple of days.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.820
AUDIENCE: But I would then like
for the customer perspective

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.947
just closing three seconds.

00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:42.780
GARY GENSLER: So it's
a really interesting--

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.070
there's a bifurcated market.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.690
From the customer's
perspective, there's

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.490
great speed of settlement.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.760
For the merchant's
side, the merchant

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.650
might not have that is
what you're highlighting.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.040
Sorry.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.920
AUDIENCE: So are
those for the bank?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.740
Like if I have never had a
bank account and [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.770
so it's very difficult for me
to go through all this process.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.770
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so financial inclusion.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.420
So we had cost, financial
inclusion, latency at least

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.170
for the merchant side, lots of
intermediaries as Brodish said.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.570
There's a lot of ledgers--

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.800
there are multiple ledgers that
might have some reconciliation

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.350
and cost to them.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.490
Sure, Sean.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.560
AUDIENCE: Real
time FX settlement.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.600
GARY GENSLER: Real
time FX settlement.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.240
What do you mean there?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.470
AUDIENCE: When you
have one currency,

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.170
it basically can convert the--

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.415
if you have the US dollar
[INAUDIBLE] to Russian ruble.

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:45.215
And then if you can
pledge that into one kind

00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:47.435
of cryptocurrency,
you could actually

00:14:47.435 --> 00:14:51.000
resize you know that token,
you can settle the trade

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.950
right away.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.790
GARY GENSLER: So I
think I'm with you.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.540
It's basically cross-border.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.360
Jumping from one currency,
one fiat currency

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.450
to another, which happens
to be technically jumping

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.520
from one ledger system--

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.850
the US dollar ledger
system, did you say ruble?

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.675
Ruble.

00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:08.800
Do they have ledgers there?

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.050
Yeah, they have ledgers there.

00:15:13.565 --> 00:15:18.680
You know, as a
background story, I

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.950
used to attend the
financial stability board

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.160
meetings in Switzerland
from time to time.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.180
And when Russia was going to
have the next G20 meeting--

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.460
I think it's next going
to be in Argentina,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.160
but that was the year is
going to be in Russia--

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.220
the deputy governor
of the central bank

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.630
wanted to have a
dive into issues

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.020
that were in my area,
the derivatives space.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.700
So I got to know
something of that.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.700
They do have ledgers is
what I just want to say.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.480
I did know this.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.310
So what are some of the things?

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.550
I heard from you cost,
delayed settlement especially

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.050
for the merchant side.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.990
I didn't hear anybody
talk about charge backs.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.840
So does anybody want to tell
me about why merchants are not

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.160
happy what's called
charge backs,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.557
or is this something
more a US thing?

00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:13.840
Brodish?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:20.300
AUDIENCE: So we saw the last
class that out of $100, $2.75

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.620
was being given
to the friend of.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.050
Multiple interpreter is
like the issuing bank

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.250
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.875
GARY GENSLER: So
there's a lot of cost,

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.850
2 and 3/4 percent
in the US, when it's

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.430
crossed the credit card rails.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.120
But one of the features
is charge backs.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.745
AUDIENCE: There's just a lack
of finality to the transactions.

00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:40.290
So I think you talked about
the example of the campaign

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.360
after the campaign
was over having people

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.620
claiming the charges
were fraud or whatever

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.227
and having to give
back [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:47.227 --> 00:16:48.060
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.600
So merchants don't
really have finality.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.106
Jack.

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:55.603
AUDIENCE: Sometimes charge
backs are recourse for things

00:16:55.603 --> 00:16:56.770
that weren't actually spent.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.490
So doesn't this kind
of affect what--

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.240
consumers might not
be as willing to enter

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.157
a transaction that has
that level of finality.

00:17:02.157 --> 00:17:03.157
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:04.907
So I think-- remind
me your first name?

00:17:04.907 --> 00:17:05.490
AUDIENCE: Dan.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.240
GARY GENSLER: Dan.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.670
So Dan and Jack really
have the two sides of this.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.589
From the consumer--

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.560
I'm sorry, Jack's
the consumer side,

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.910
and Dan's the merchant side.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.819
From the merchant, they
want finality of settlement.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.000
They want, I've
sold you a good--

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.560
I was working on a campaign.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.760
We weren't selling a good,
but we got a donation

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.310
and we wanted to know
that $2,700 was there.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.130
Or I sell a good, a cup
of coffee, and it's done.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.040
But from Jack's
perspective, well, I

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.330
might not have gotten
a good or service.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.610
I'm going to dispute it.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.390
You say that I'm a monthly
subscriber to the New York

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.890
Times.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.140
I'm not a monthly subscriber
to the New York Times.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.560
I don't want to pay the
$15 a month because I'm not

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.680
getting the New York Times,
and it's called a charge back.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.250
And so it's really consumers
and merchants are a little bit

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.020
on the different side,
but in the US that's

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.170
part of that 2 and 3/4 percent.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.410
But merchants, probably
in the US at least

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.420
say, I'd rather not be there.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.960
And then it's whether customers
are going to push back.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.790
Fraud, of course.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.460
Privacy I didn't
hear anybody say,

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.060
but the current payment rails
actually in the modern computer

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.620
age gives everybody along the
chain, a lot of information

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.950
about all of us.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.510
Now, many of us don't mind it.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.220
I still want to
use my Visa card,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.260
and I want to use
my bank account,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.180
but know that we
are all giving up

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.270
a little bit of our
personal identity

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.310
because they know how we spend.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.960
And based on those
spending patterns,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.750
they can know whether we like
guns or we don't like guns.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.010
And in the political
space there's

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.600
people sort of look
at those things.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:57.520
Or how you live your
life in many ways.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.180
And in good ways,
too, because it

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.570
means they can market to us
what books we want to read,

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.270
and what wines we want to drink.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.720
But it's privacy, as well.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.300
Financial inclusion
was mentioned.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.600
Rahim?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.600
AUDIENCE: To the
privacy is cyber attacks

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.920
and identity theft.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.925
So I will say this
is a big pain point.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.050
GARY GENSLER: So I should--

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:21.800
good.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.240
I agree with you.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.740
Cyber attacks and so forth.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.110
So with all these pain
points the question is,

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.890
will blockchain help address
some of these or all of these?

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.657
So then we go back to
benefits of blockchain.

00:19:33.657 --> 00:19:35.240
What are the two big
benefits that you

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.510
keep hearing me spout about
whether it's from Christian

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.120
Catalini's paper or just--

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.890
Kelly?

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.970
AUDIENCE: The cost
of the network

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.810
and then the cost
of the verification.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.030
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
so verification cost

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.150
and networking cost.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.817
We're not going to
go back through this,

00:19:49.817 --> 00:19:57.150
but can lowering the
verification cost address

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.320
basically some of
these pain points,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.480
including this
cybersecurity one?

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.210
And where does
that fit together?

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.690
I mean, Alon?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.820
AUDIENCE: I would add, does
blockchain add problems?

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.760
So it may solve some problem
but add other problems.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.890
And then we need to nab those
problems and seize them.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.490
GARY GENSLER:
You're ahead of me.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.670
No, no, it's good.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.020
It's good.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.820
In fact I'm going
to go, challenges.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.560
Which problems
you're going to add.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.477
AUDIENCE: Scalability.

00:20:30.477 --> 00:20:31.560
GARY GENSLER: Scalability.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.410
What other problems?

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.950
Brodish I've heard
from, over here.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.130
AUDIENCE: High
transaction costs.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.290
GARY GENSLER: High transaction
costs, one blockchain.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.080
AUDIENCE: Takes some days
to process the transaction.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.250
It's slow.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.630
GARY GENSLER: So it's slow.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.070
So scalability is slow.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.570
It might be high
transaction costs.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.070
Alexis?

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.480
AUDIENCE: And interoperability.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.780
GARY GENSLER: Interoperability.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.970
So it's all our friends.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:54.860
Stephanie?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.538
AUDIENCE: There's also the
issue of error resolution.

00:20:57.538 --> 00:20:58.830
GARY GENSLER: Error resolution.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.560
Good one.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.160
AUDIENCE: Like
when consumers are

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.300
trying to fix something wrong
with like fraudulent card

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.350
transaction or something.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.277
Like with blockchain, if it's
immutable you can't do that.

00:21:09.277 --> 00:21:11.110
GARY GENSLER: Right,
so it's this trade-off.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.890
It's a little bit like what Jack
was saying about charge backs.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.770
From the customer's side there
might be an actual error--

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.875
it's a different type
of error, but an error,

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:21.250
and I want to be
able to say, I'm

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.590
not taking the New
York Times any longer.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.380
I'm sorry to the New York
Times, I'm just picking.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.550
But you're saying there
could be true error.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.640
Shimon, did you--

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.600
AUDIENCE: Isn't
like the core system

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.552
where we have these delays in,
is that really technologically

00:21:35.552 --> 00:21:37.510
advance-- sort of a
business issue in the sense

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:43.670
that [INAUDIBLE] finality opens
up a lot of exposure for fraud.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.150
So the core level that
we see will probably

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:51.270
go up a lot if someone
could game the system,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.970
get their cash out
at the same time.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.740
It'd be very hard
to trace it back.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.780
GARY GENSLER: So
Shimon's raising,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.090
maybe we have
delayed settlement.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.970
Maybe we don't have
immediate finality

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:11.160
because as a market feature we
want some delayed settlement

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.030
to protect against fraud, to
make sure that there's not

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.650
errors as Stephanie says.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.750
Maybe there's a delay
for business reasons.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.850
But-- Kelly?

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.560
Now, anybody want to
take the other side?

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.185
I want somebody to
take the other side.

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:28.080
This Alin.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.360
AUDIENCE: I mean, I'm
biased, I'll admit it.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.510
But I think that
basically that says

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.400
let let's have an
inferior system out there

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.680
because it's good.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.480
And it's like, yeah,
I mean, I think

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.880
to some extent you do
want-- there are benefits

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.653
to having a delayed settlement.

00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:45.570
But there are also a lot
of benefits on having

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.360
finality, so why not have both?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.690
You don't need just have
an inferior settlement

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.670
kind of system out there and
say, OK, this is established.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.665
You can also bring
another solution right

00:22:56.665 --> 00:22:58.290
beside it that actually
offers finality

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.270
for people who want it.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.600
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so if everybody remembers,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.650
Alin works at the digital
currency initiative.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.163
Used to work in payments.

00:23:04.163 --> 00:23:06.330
He's admitting he might
have a little bit of a bias,

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.720
but he's saying, fine, you
want some delayed settlement.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.940
But shouldn't we
have an alternative?

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.970
Because not every market
will want delayed settlement.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.520
Eric?

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but I just wanted

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.590
to tie these two points of view
to another challenge, which

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.982
is the issues on the
handling of governance.

00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:27.690
In the case of
[INAUDIBLE],, for example,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.370
there's a little bit of
more elaborate governance

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.330
of the distributed
arrangement of the blockchain.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:41.680
That decision between going
from supposedly a theft close--

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.450
a fork.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.440
So handling a
centralized arrangement

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.230
is much easier than a
blockchain [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.680
GARY GENSLER: Rhys?

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.870
AUDIENCE: Another challenge
is the government regulation

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.820
on the anti money laundering
and the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.780
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, right.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.540
So-- Kelly?

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.810
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if this
ties into the finality of it,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.170
but one of the articles talked
a little bit about the fact

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.320
that there is an issue with
managing liquidity given

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.390
the speed of the
transactions, especially

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.120
at the corporate level where
the value of the transactions

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.510
are much higher.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.737
There's a bit of an opportunity
cost trade-off there.

00:24:24.737 --> 00:24:25.570
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.400
So we're going to
chat about that

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.830
in a minute about the
liquidity in particularly

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.320
using a cryptocurrency as
a bridge between two fiat

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.890
currencies.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.470
But it has somewhat to
do with the volatility

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.200
of cryptocurrencies.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.570
But I would say to
this point about--

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:54.090
I'm coming back to Alin versus
Dan, or Shimon, really--

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.110
sorry, different debate.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.460
I think that this new technology
is coming along at a time

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.990
where we can shorten
settlement, and a lot

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.950
of the delayed settlement
in payments, in Wall Street,

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:14.670
and securities we used to have
that you would do equity trades

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.940
transaction day plus five days.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.680
Before I was born,
too, long time ago.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.430
Then it went to
transaction day plus three.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.640
And in Europe they went to
transaction plus two days--

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.280
two days for settlement
of securities trades

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.070
somewhere 10 or 15 years
ago, and the US caught up.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:37.170
The US was behind and just went
to transaction plus two days.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:44.370
But I think technology could
be t plus 0 in securities,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.140
and in payments you could
go to real time payments.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.040
The US Federal Reserve
had a big process

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.810
where they got public
comment, and they're

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.460
moving towards what's called
real time payments by 2020.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.520
Now, maybe it will be adopted in
2021 because it'll take longer

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:12.260
to roll out, but I think
that technology does provide

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.040
that it will be more options.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.690
And in some cases,
the markets will

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.740
stay with delayed settlement
because it's just history,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.913
it's just legacy.

00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:26.080
And other times it will
stay with delayed settlement

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.490
because they actually prefer it.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.190
I think in the securities
world some people actually

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.020
prefer delayed settlement.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.890
We'll talk about this
in a few lectures,

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.870
but they'd prefer it because it
allows shorting of securities.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.120
When you actually borrow
somebody else's security

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.360
and sell it, you usually
sell it before you borrow it.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.560
And so the whole parts
of our capital markets

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.290
that are built around
delayed settlement,

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.880
because you usually sell,
borrow, and settle rather

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.580
than borrow, sell, and settle.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.330
AUDIENCE: So if you
put securities lending

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.540
on a blockchain, then you're
able to immediately point

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.840
to the varo that you
get and trace that back.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.360
When you then have
securities lending on a t0

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.190
and you can short on
t0, know exactly what

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.280
securities will be borrowed?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.420
GARY GENSLER: I think that it
is technically feasible to move

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.160
stock borrow onto a blockchain.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.700
I'm agreeing with that.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.390
But the question is whether
the economics of that market--

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.330
whether the market participants
want to actually arrange

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.630
the borrow before they
sell because currently

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.060
they sell before they
arrange the borrow.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.850
AUDIENCE: But they have to get
the locate on that same day,

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.380
right?

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.190
GARY GENSLER: Well, when it's
t plus 2 depending upon--

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.480
I'm sorry I'm speaking finance
here, but maybe you'll help me.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.460
AUDIENCE: Well we have to give--

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.460
I used to be in
sales and training.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.460
We had to get a borrow,
like a reference number,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:58.160
before someone shorted something
so they couldn't short.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.930
I don't know if it's
changed, so I don't know.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.560
GARY GENSLER: No,
it might be that I'm

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.870
the old season dog that
was-- now that you're

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.340
saying they're tighter.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.940
But--

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.940
AUDIENCE: If a client
wanted to short something,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.270
they would call me, and then I'd
have to call the market maker,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.570
get a borrow, get
a reference number.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.710
And they would carve off
that amount, whatever

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.420
they wanted to
borrow, so it wasn't

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.830
available for anyone else.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.270
Then they sold it.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.510
So it was like--

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.668
it was done on a
ledger, but yeah.

00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:29.210
GARY GENSLER: So the market may
already be moving towards it.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.680
AUDIENCE: So I work in the
securities lending desk

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.952
that he used to call.

00:28:31.952 --> 00:28:32.910
That's what I'm saying.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.690
And that came into
effect after 2008

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.090
with the no naked short selling.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.097
And so then you had to
get the locate on teaser

00:28:42.097 --> 00:28:43.680
on the same exact
day that you borrow.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.058
But you didn't actually need
to borrow the stocks until t3.

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.100
GARY GENSLER: So you just
had to have the locate.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.810
AUDIENCE: You just need to
have a good locate on it.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.130
AUDIENCE: So you
couldn't double lend.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.672
AUDIENCE: But I
guess my question was

00:28:53.672 --> 00:28:55.400
if you moved that
securities lending

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.250
transaction to a blockchain,
you could immediately borrow it

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.820
and be able to trace that.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.435
And then when it
came against recall--

00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:02.810
GARY GENSLER: So
for those of you

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.600
that are not as close to the
world of finance, and stock

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.470
loan, and stock borrow,
the point of the discussion

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:16.830
is that markets have evolved
built upon delayed settlement.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.390
And the delayed
settlement may well

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.180
have been because they all
evolved from paper, not

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.860
computer days.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.560
So we had authorization,
clearing, settling

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.600
in the payment
world, but in stock

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.330
borrow you had to actually
locate a security to sell.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.310
It sounds like there's
some market evolution

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.910
post-2008 that you actually
had to add an identifier,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.890
though you didn't
have to borrow.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.510
My point is that all of this
can be put on a blockchain,

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.630
but there's also
economic market realities

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.240
as to whether somebody wants to.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.980
And I think, let's
see, if you're

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.630
Dan you don't want charge backs
but Jack still wants them.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.210
And in the delayed
settlement Shimon

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.670
wants to keep his
delayed settlement,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.200
and Alin wants to
go the other way.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.580
And I suspect that in some
markets, let's go with Dan

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:15.490
and Alin are together, that
finality will be important.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.610
And what blockchain
allows, it allows

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:24.270
for the economics of finality
to be a fair debate in a sense.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.840
A level whereas in the
past you couldn't even

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.310
have the debate because
it was so paper intensive.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.280
So blockchain changes
that economics.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.035
Let me go back a
slide to say why--

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.450
what are the
possible suitability

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.390
of payments to the
blockchain technology world?

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.190
And these were some
that I threw out.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.100
Payment systems use ledgers.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.800
Geez all right,
that's the sweet spot.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.140
They use ledgers.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.120
In fact, that's what
Satoshi Nakamoto

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.980
started this whole thing on.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.890
Multiple parties
certainly want to read,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.050
and in a lot of circumstances
multiple parties

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.650
want to write to the ledger.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.670
Like actually record
to the ledger.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.580
So it's kind of right
in the middle of this.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.990
You might be able to
lower verification costs,

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.500
but more importantly
verification costs

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.380
are really critical to
the economics of payment.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.610
That you have the money that
you say you have, or the value.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.870
You're sending it to this
account and not that account.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.790
So in a sense, I look
at this and I go,

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:41.650
this feels like fertile ground
that hasn't yet been plowed.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.440
Because 10 year anniversary--

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:52.030
or birthday-- we're
still not there.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.800
But any other thoughts?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.360
I mean, micro
payments is another,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.907
but Alin, you're the expert.

00:31:56.907 --> 00:31:58.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
the one thing that I think

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.810
is exciting to some of the folks
in the DCI, myself included,

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.310
is the fact that
we can attach codes

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.890
to these movements of value.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.770
So you can program
these chunks of money.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.040
GARY GENSLER: And are
you saying attach code

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.650
to identify it's
Kelly's payment,

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.890
or it's James' payment, or
are you saying identify code

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.110
in the form of smart contracts?

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.210
AUDIENCE: Basically
it's smart contract.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.770
Just say, hey,
you know what, I'm

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.600
going to release the funds
of this individual side

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.350
and this individual
side at the same time,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.767
and then you get
the money, right?

00:32:30.767 --> 00:32:33.640
And that adds an additional
layer of complexity

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.790
that traditional payments of
the Visa, MasterCard variety

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.140
don't have.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.190
So you get a whole new layer,
for lack of a better word,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.950
of possibilities.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.173
When you start
adding, OK, I'm going

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:47.590
to I'm going to
give you something

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.840
if it's sunny outside.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.868
OK, we can make that
happen real time.

00:32:52.868 --> 00:32:54.410
GARY GENSLER: We
didn't have a real--

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.980
AUDIENCE: Would that
eliminate some cost and--

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.850
I mean, with the
Visas and whatnot?

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.380
GARY GENSLER: Can you say a
little louder just so we--

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.050
AUDIENCE: I get his
point, yes, but I

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.290
mean, it will eliminate
the trust issue,

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.620
which is with the Visa?

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.840
GARY GENSLER: I'm
not sure I get why.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.330
AUDIENCE: The cost, and
the transaction movement,

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.430
and the validation.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:19.810
Wouldn't that be eliminated?

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.850
Yes, you have a smart contract.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.295
It's adding a layer.

00:33:23.295 --> 00:33:26.260
But on the other hand, it's
eliminating some layers

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.050
from the other process, as well.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so assuming--

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.090
so the onus is on
the technologies

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.660
that build this to make
sure that you don't lose

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.580
functionality that you
have in a Visa world

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.490
because otherwise nobody would
use this whole new way of doing

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:40.135
payments.

00:33:40.135 --> 00:33:41.510
So it's assumed
that you may take

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.100
part of what the technology
offers and then add

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.872
additional functionality.

00:33:46.872 --> 00:33:48.580
GARY GENSLER: I'm
going to say I'm pretty

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.500
relaxed about the open laptops.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.160
I get less relaxed about
people texting during class,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.980
and I know that we're
all multitaskers.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.188
But I'm the most
relaxed you can imagine,

00:34:00.188 --> 00:34:02.230
but I'm starting to get
a little on my edge here.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.740
Tom?

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.550
AUDIENCE: So I get
that blockchain

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.930
allows for smart contracts,
and it's obviously

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.833
a much more brute
force system where

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:11.500
you're talking about
like attaching code

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.120
or the payments are automated.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.150
I think of like I set up an
automatic payment of my cable

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:16.889
bill every month.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:20.860
And so it's like as soon as
that payment comes to me,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.600
I pre-authorize
it to go through.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:28.989
So why can't you, in a
non-blockchain setting,

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:31.730
establish basically a smart
contract that's got some more--

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.730
GARY GENSLER: A
conditional payment?

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.730
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.010
So do you have to
have a blockchain

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.257
to have a smart contract?

00:34:39.257 --> 00:34:41.090
AUDIENCE: Sorry, if I
could respond to that.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.540
One of the coolest use
cases that I've heard--

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.889
and I'm not going to name
any entities, but you know,

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.280
this blockchain-based
let's say company

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.100
for lack of a better word who
wants to pay their employees.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.949
And I said, look,
you join me here now,

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.777
we're going to make a smart
contract that basically

00:34:57.777 --> 00:35:00.110
is going to pay you for your
services for the next three

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.170
years period.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:01.670
That's it.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.410
There's no additional at
such a such frequency.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.500
And we sign a contract
now and that's it.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.850
You're going to get paid, right?

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.550
And then you start
working and you actually

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.680
have a very ensured
way that I will get

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.140
paid that nobody can stop it.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.677
Today you don't have that.

00:35:17.677 --> 00:35:19.760
There are many things that
will happen-- you know,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.460
management happens,
you know, whatever

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.960
happens I can find a way to--
got to get around all of that,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.980
right?

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.480
That's kind of
useful to make sure

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.563
that, hey, I'm going to
get paid for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:28.563 --> 00:35:29.560
That's useful.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.240
AUDIENCE: Do you have
to then put aside--

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.340
like if I am your
employer, I have

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.110
to put that three years worth
of salary into a lockbox

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.360
and I can't do anything with
it for those three years?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if
you're escrowing

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.527
three years more work.

00:35:42.527 --> 00:35:46.013
AUDIENCE: It's a limitation.

00:35:46.013 --> 00:35:47.180
All of this is a limitation.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.750
It's not like you
suddenly have free money,

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.330
it's all good for
everyone, right?

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.790
But there are useful things
that show up-- usable things

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.990
that we never thought about.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.490
So I think all I'm
saying that there

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:56.765
are a lot of possibilities.

00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:58.760
And I don't know the
right use case for it.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.870
And I don't know,
it's just an example

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.465
that I thought was like, that's
pretty cool, I could use this.

00:36:02.465 --> 00:36:03.590
But you know, you're right.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.850
I mean, there are
many implications.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.070
But just the very fact that
you have a whole new area

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.510
to explore, to me
that's exciting.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.655
Like we've seen what
the system does.

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:12.530
We've seen it, right?

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.530
Like we bank 90% of the people.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.423
If you're in the 10%,
that's kind of sucky.

00:36:17.423 --> 00:36:19.590
But for the [INAUDIBLE],,
this kind of works, right?

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.500
You know, you have deep lines
too, it's awesome, right?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.830
But we've hit the
ceiling of what

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.528
we can do with this system.

00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:28.070
Maybe there's an
additional approach.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:29.300
Let's see what happens there.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.925
GARY GENSLER: I
invited Alin because we

00:36:30.925 --> 00:36:36.110
needed a little bit more
maximalism in the room

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.730
I'm sorry, James?

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.100
AUDIENCE: But think back
to the point earlier,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.930
it's do we really
need blockchain

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:46.420
to do a lot of the stuff that
smart contracts promised to do?

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.822
I mean, I set up my--

00:36:47.822 --> 00:36:49.280
in the UK, our
system [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.470
That happens, that just
disappeared from my account

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.490
at a certain time period.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.680
Doesn't involve blockchain.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.630
I could see some benefits
of blockchain, but again,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.410
a lot of the smart
contracts, can we

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.210
not already use
existing systems,

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.442
make those systems better?

00:37:04.442 --> 00:37:06.400
But this goes back to
the whole payment system.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.810
There are a lot of
players in the field that

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.786
haven't been innovating the
last 20 years, what we read.

00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:17.460
But can they not make existing
systems so much better

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.742
without the use of blockchain?

00:37:18.742 --> 00:37:20.700
GARY GENSLER: So the
question is, do you really

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.260
need blockchain or
is it just going

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.500
to be a catalyst for sort of
the legacy systems to kind of

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.400
do what they otherwise
technologically could have done

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.680
but it's a kind of sharp kick
in the backside to kind of do

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.147
a little bit better?

00:37:36.147 --> 00:37:37.980
AUDIENCE: That's a
really good point, right?

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.250
That's something that we
debate a lot about them.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.332
And it actually
is as we sit now,

00:37:42.332 --> 00:37:44.790
it's absolutely possible that
this would be the way, right?

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.402
So one example that shows
up frequently is BitTorrent.

00:37:47.402 --> 00:37:49.360
So BitTorrent, for those
of you who don't know,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.575
it's a way in which you share
video online and nobody--

00:37:52.575 --> 00:37:54.520
it has a lot of
problems with it,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.850
but it catalyzed and change the
entire distribution of media,

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.683
right?

00:37:58.683 --> 00:38:00.600
It has a lot of problems
so it didn't work out

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.450
the way folks thought it would,
but it still kind of changed

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.523
the whole industry.

00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:06.440
And it is absolutely
possible that blockchains

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.010
will take that path.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.565
It's unclear now, but
it's absolutely possible.

00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:11.940
GARY GENSLER: So
blockchain could

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.520
be just a catalyst
like BitTorrent was,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.520
and then all of a sudden at the
end of the day we got Apple--

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.740
what do they call it?

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.360
Apple Store, thank you.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.497
But Zan, were you're trying to--

00:38:26.497 --> 00:38:28.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah well, I was
going to build on that.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.560
I think I've already
seen that happening.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.650
Like I was looking
into Swift recently

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.350
and I think after blockchain
in the past few years

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.680
they launched the Global
Payments Innovation Initiative.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.050
Which seems like, all
right, we recognize

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.300
that our infrastructure
is legacy

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.235
and we need to do something
to kind of keep current.

00:38:47.235 --> 00:38:49.110
And they've spent and
invested a ton of money

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.430
in unifying standards across
the messaging platform

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.950
and making it much
easier to use.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.080
So not a blockchain
solution, but has certainly

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.663
been an event.

00:38:57.663 --> 00:38:59.955
GARY GENSLER: Right, so it's
been a catalyst for Swift.

00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:01.520
Ripple has been a
catalyst for Swift

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.750
that we're going to
talk about in a minute,

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.420
but others have been as well.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.430
But I still would
challenge the group--

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.860
and it's sort of what we're
all trying to do here--

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:14.030
are there still opportunities
that an append-only log,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.660
that you're appending,
you're adding information

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:23.660
to the registry or the ledger,
you're not deleting it--

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.040
well, this is going to be good--

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.250
and you need a consensus
of multiple parties writing

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.810
to the ledger.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.328
A special guest.

00:39:31.328 --> 00:39:32.552
AUDIENCE: Hi, it's Sri.

00:39:32.552 --> 00:39:33.650
Many of you know me.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.040
GARY GENSLER: Sri
many people might now

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.985
is Priya's significant
other-- husband, I think.

00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:40.610
AUDIENCE: But that's
not why he's here.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.320
GARY GENSLER: He's not here--
he's here as a payment expert.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.530
AUDIENCE: No, that's
the reason why I'm here.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.800
GARY GENSLER: No, but
you are a payment--

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.420
do you want to introduce--

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.837
AUDIENCE: Well,
I'm not an expert.

00:39:47.837 --> 00:39:50.480
I work for MasterCard,
and I happen

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.890
to be Pria's husband, as well.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.477
I've been in this
industry for a few years.

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:57.310
AUDIENCE: Priceless.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.690
AUDIENCE: Price?

00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.700
AUDIENCE: Priceless.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.533
AUDIENCE: Priceless.

00:40:00.533 --> 00:40:02.052
Exactly, we're
still running that.

00:40:02.052 --> 00:40:04.010
GARY GENSLER: So you're
at MasterCard payments,

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.800
and give us your
thoughts on this.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.020
AUDIENCE: So I'm actually
in the opposite camp

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.050
from this blockchain
and cryptocurrency

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.130
for a few reasons.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.140
GARY GENSLER: So you're
in a minimalist camp?

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.120
AUDIENCE: You can
call it minimalist.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.830
I believe that you
can do everything

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.280
that blockchain promises
it does using the currency

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.520
systems we have.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.420
There are a couple
of reasons for that.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.580
Number one is crypto
is expensive average

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.060
per transaction.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.790
You can always
secure transactions

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:42.090
in systems we have today
using technologies that exist,

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.300
but you don't need to have
a Bitcoin or a blockchain,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.250
as an example.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.070
So interlockability
that you're talking

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.360
about when it comes to
Bitcoin and the other kind

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.610
of advantages about
distributed measures,

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.160
everything can be accomplished
through the systems

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.480
we have today.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.500
They just don't choose to do
it because it's expensive,

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.560
and it will be expensive
when you scale blockchain

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.180
to the millions of people in
other industries you have.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.860
It will become expensive
there, as well.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.960
So the two main things that are
important in payment systems

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.690
are acceptance and scale.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.100
Simple.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.160
If you achieve the acceptance
and scale to blockchain, sure.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.410
That'll work, and everybody
will be using blockchains,

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.410
and Bitcoins, and
it'll all work.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.530
The problem is it's
taken us 40 years

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.550
to achieve acceptance of scale
with Visa and MasterCard,

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.290
and [INAUDIBLE] of
this whole ecosystem.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.090
It's taken a long time.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.650
And it's working.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.710
And if you want to replace
that with this new system

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.050
and achieve the same level
of acceptance and scale,

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.130
think about how big
of an effort that is.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.620
It's almost impossible.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.270
And the amount of dollars you
would have to spend on that,

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.710
why?

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.950
GARY GENSLER: So I see a
few people want to take--

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.460
Hugo are you going to
take the other side?

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.033
AUDIENCE: I can start, sure.

00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:09.950
GARY GENSLER: And then
we're going to move on,

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.320
but I want to hear
the other side.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.960
And I thank you for being
willing to speak up,

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.620
because it's really helpful.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.640
And I don't know your role at
MasterCard, but it's just--

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.140
what's that?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.220
AUDIENCE: Product management.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.600
GARY GENSLER:
Product management.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.068
But you're speaking for yourself
personally or MasterCard?

00:42:27.068 --> 00:42:29.360
AUDIENCE: MasterCard is
dabbling in blockchain as well,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.212
so I'm speaking for personally.

00:42:32.212 --> 00:42:33.920
GARY GENSLER: Because
MasterCard actually

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.010
filed a patent with
the US Patent Office

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.570
for crypto fractional banking.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:45.200
And Bank of America has 43
patents in the crypto space,

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.390
and Visa's filed for
patents in the book.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.200
So you have Visa, Bank
of America MasterCard,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.090
and others filing for patents
on blockchain fractional banking

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.330
payments and so forth.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.650
So it's sort of an
interesting side.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:04.130
We'll get established
Professor Lessig.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.840
AUDIENCE: Just one
qualification on this.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.320
It kind of depends on
who you are right now.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.300
I mean, because this is all
true as a description of banking

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.640
in the developed world,
but to the extent

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.650
you're talking about
these transactions

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.580
outside the developed
world then the coefficients

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.170
on these variables
changes significantly.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.120
So if you have no reliable
legal infrastructure,

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.150
then blockchain technology
becomes a real plus

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.680
relative to a world
where you have

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.240
a very reliable infrastructure,
which is obviously developed.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.280
GARY GENSLER: So
what Larry shared

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.800
with us is, well, there's a
lot of different countries--

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.015
180.

00:43:44.015 --> 00:43:47.190
There's 1.7 billion people
still not banked in the world.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.240
Half of sub-Saharan
Africa, for instance.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.840
So there is still
a challenge there.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.070
I'm sorry, Hugo, we--

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.630
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say something similar.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.727
Like I appreciate
the argument but it

00:43:59.727 --> 00:44:01.810
kind of sounds like, it's
not broke, don't fix it.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:05.000
Like we've spent so much
money building this system.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.160
So you know it
works now, but like,

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.590
let's not look at what
technological innovation can

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.090
add.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.882
AUDIENCE: Well no,
that's not what I meant.

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:16.640
What I meant was it's not if
it's not broken, don't fix it.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.020
We have achieved so much in the
payments world over the past 40

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.340
years.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.430
Improve it while maintaining the
goodness of the infrastructure

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.080
that exists today, instead
of blockchain is just a rip

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.890
and replace the whole thing
which doesn't solve a purpose.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:34.580
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.990
I don't think that blockchain
is the, like, one stop shop

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.280
for everything.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.530
I'm more on the
Bitcoin maximalist side

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:46.850
where I think, sure, if you have
a global currency where you can

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:52.100
go anywhere, and use it,
and it's self-sovereign

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.560
and you can do all that,
that would be great.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:01.490
I know like MasterCard and Visa
have an interest in saying,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.590
well, we've spent
so much money, you

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.120
can use MasterCard and Visa
in most places in the world.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.810
But what happens if you go
into the middle of some village

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.120
in India or sub-Saharan
Africa or wherever,

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.540
and they don't
take a credit card.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.290
But they have a cell phone
with a Bitcoin wallet,

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.670
I can still transact there.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.075
And yeah.

00:45:24.075 --> 00:45:27.045
AUDIENCE: You can transact
with a real currency, also.

00:45:27.045 --> 00:45:29.060
AUDIENCE: Right,
but then they have

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.870
to go through the process of
changing that and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:36.263
GARY GENSLER: So let's take
Brodish and then we'll--

00:45:36.263 --> 00:45:37.680
this is a good
debate, by the way.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.090
AUDIENCE: Since the
discussion came to India, so--

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.184 --> 00:45:43.886
GARY GENSLER: So we
have our expert now.

00:45:43.886 --> 00:45:47.570
AUDIENCE: So there could be
a third solution, as well.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.860
So we have once we're in the
readings of the last class,

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.110
as well, the united
payment interests in India,

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.630
which is not a
blockchain solution.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.270
So the government of
India has actually

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:02.330
promoted a new entity
called a payment bank, which

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.790
is like a no frills,
no service kind of bank

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:08.540
to promote financial inclusion.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.600
And based on that, just using
a unique identification number

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.700
and just a mobile device you
can make any sort of payments

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.340
of any denomination.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.740
It can be very, very
local currency as well,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.480
and you can do all of
that at real time basis

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.320
without any of these
intermediaries.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.410
And those are low
cost transactions

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.452
without leveraging on the
blockchain technology.

00:46:30.452 --> 00:46:32.410
AUDIENCE: So what you
need an [INAUDIBLE] card?

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.990
AUDIENCE: You need a [INAUDIBLE]
card, which is more than--

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.747
it's more than 95%
coverage in the country.

00:46:37.747 --> 00:46:39.330
AUDIENCE: What's the
name of the card?

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.460
Just like, do you need some
form of identification?

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.640
GARY GENSLER: So
India's really been

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.840
at the cutting edge in the
last, say, two to three years

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.020
partly because
they could leapfrog

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.430
some of the card rails.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.270
There was not broad
adoption or access

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.930
Sri has talked about in
India for credit cards.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.850
And so similar to
what we saw in Kenya

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.230
And we talked about
on Tuesday in China

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:11.090
where companies, private
sector, leapfrogged,

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.550
in India it was more if I
believe it was the government

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.350
sector rather than
the private sector

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.400
said we want to bring a
great many of the population

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.020
into a system.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.620
So they created a
unique ID system.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.040
I can't remember the
name of each of these.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.380
That's the card.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.960
They created a payment--

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.205
IMSP, if I got that right?

00:47:35.205 --> 00:47:36.580
AUDIENCE: IMPS
was the older one.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.038
Now it's UPI.

00:47:38.038 --> 00:47:39.080
United payment interface.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.470
GARY GENSLER: A payment system,
which is not 270 basis points

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.890
but probably is measured and
single to low double digit

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:48.560
basis points.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.490
Your actual pay, everybody
in India, your employment

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:56.700
goes into this.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.100
And there's biometrics
as well to the ID system.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.170
Now there, might be
cybersecurity risks

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.070
that this is all then in a
sense somewhat centralized.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:09.610
But India sort of leapfrogged.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.870
It's kind of interesting.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.240
But we've had a lively debate.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.320
Is finality something
we want or not?

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.570
Is charge back something
we want or not?

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.520
Can you do this all
without blockchain,

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.250
or is blockchain
something that's needed?

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.440
And of course, the question
even if blockchain's

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.710
really kind of neat
and good, will it just

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.520
get the incumbents to
move a little bit more

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.470
into innovation and
lowering their costs?

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.950
Do you want to
close this one out?

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.720
AUDIENCE: I think I
may add something else.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.820
It's censorship resistant.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:46.160
So everyone can be
exchanging Bitcoins

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.475
without any government
forbidding it.

00:48:49.475 --> 00:48:51.350
GARY GENSLER: Now, it's
an interesting thing.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:56.150
If it's censorship resistant
to you must extend me credit

00:48:56.150 --> 00:49:00.230
and you can't decide whether
I get credit based on my race,

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.350
or religion, or
ethnicity, and so forth,

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.690
that's probably something
a broad group of people

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.580
would say, that's pretty good.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.340
But if it's censorship
resistant to being like you can

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.810
drug traffic society might say,
well, that's not what we want.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.160
So it's an interesting set of--

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.400
when the technology allows
you to be censorship resistant

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.980
but society says,
well, there's still

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:30.155
some social cohesion about drug
trafficking, or child labor.

00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:33.080
And I'm using the ones
that are easy to hold onto,

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.840
so it's a little
interesting debate.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.300
Yes?

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.690
AUDIENCE: So when we're speaking
about the underdeveloped

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.340
and developing part
of the economy,

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.590
and payments, and blockchain--

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:46.860
GARY GENSLER: Professor
Lessig's comments.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.280
And I think one thing
that we haven't addressed

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.140
is the last mile,
which is liquidity.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.250
And so even if blockchain
addresses, let's say,

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.590
the accountability
of the transfer,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.860
what it doesn't address
is the actual liquidity

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.000
and utilization in the last
mile on the ground, which

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.830
is very essential to
a developing economy.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:08.940
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.350
Sorry, remind me--

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:10.850
Aviva.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:13.940
So Aviva, are you saying last
mile like that somebody could

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.470
actually use this cryptocurrency
in a store to buy their grains,

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.418
or their goods for the week
right to keep their family--

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:23.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so that
doesn't solve the problem

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.120
of adoption and scalability.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.400
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.190
Fiat money-- and before
we had paper money,

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.800
we had coins and everything--
money is a social construct.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.440
We've talked about that.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.160
And beyond its advantages
that it's used for taxes,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.190
and it's good for all debts
public and private in most

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:47.570
countries, it really is
exactly what Aviva's saying.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:51.440
That society at large
says, I will use this

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.010
as a unit of account.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:51:00.760
That whether it's my employment,
or the milled goods I'm buying

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:06.070
to feed my family, it's this
unit of account that over

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.880
hundreds of years people
adopt until they don't.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.500
I don't know how
long in Venezuela,

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.130
though I keep using their
currency as a unit of account.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.540
So sometimes there's
last mile problem

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.040
is even with fiat
currency, but I not only

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.110
hear you, I share your
thoughts that where

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:36.260
is the adoption in the last
mile, if you well said.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.820
So just we talked
about the challenges.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.400
What are some companies?

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.100
Well, there's in crypto--

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.130
and I'm listing two or three.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.140
But if you wanted to
talk about others,

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.870
I just listed in crypto
there's startups.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.280
BitPay is one of the
most popular ones where

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.590
it was basically saying
to merchants, if you

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:02.240
want to take Bitcoin, we'll
convert your Bitcoin for you

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.650
to fiat.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.272
And that's in essence
what they're doing.

00:52:06.272 --> 00:52:08.520
So I'm going to take it back
to the Hillary campaign.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:12.960
We had some donors that
wanted to give us Bitcoin.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.570
We're a merchant in
a sense, but we also

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.430
wanted to elect a president.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:19.840
And those donors might have
wanted to give us Bitcoin.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.490
So one of my colleagues had
to investigate, could we

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:29.700
take Bitcoin, and what did it
mean under federal election

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.230
law, and things like that.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.880
And we looked at whether to hire
BitPay or somebody like that.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.650
We chose not to
because we didn't

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:40.950
think there was enough donors
who really wanted to give us

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:43.290
enough Bitcoin,
and we didn't think

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.470
we would freshen
up Hillary's image

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.850
because we were
going to announce

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:51.210
she's the Bitcoin
candidate or something.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.710
Tom, did we miss it?

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.320
Is this--

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.640
AUDIENCE: Could've won
Wisconsin with that.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.723
GARY GENSLER: We could've
won Wisconsin with that.

00:52:56.723 --> 00:53:00.840
[LAUGHTER] OK.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.660
I'm going to be
apologizing until my grave

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.140
for that election,
but this is it, right?

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.920
But it's a real story.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.770
One of my colleagues
investigated it.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:13.110
I'm not trying to throw him
under the bus or anything,

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.560
but it was just like, oh
my gosh, the amount of time

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.140
we would ad spend with
Perkins Coie, the law firm,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.290
and what we would have to pay
to kind of think this through.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:28.350
And we can only take
$2,700, so every day

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.330
would be a different
number of Bitcoin.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.940
It could not be more
than $2,700 because there

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.990
was no way that we were going
to break the election laws.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.080
So ultimately, the
project went away.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.920
And the reason I share that
story is for a lot of merchants

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.080
right now, maybe as Aviva
said in the last mile,

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.145
the merchants are saying, I'm
not sure I need to do this.

00:53:50.145 --> 00:53:51.270
But there's a way to do it.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.820
If anybody in this room
starts a company and you say,

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.540
I want to take crypto, there
are companies out there

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:03.540
that will provide you that
interface and their fees.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.760
Does anybody know BitPay's fees?

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.460
It wasn't part of the
readings, but other than Alin?

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.400
All right, Alin?

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.230
AUDIENCE: 1%.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.550
GARY GENSLER: 1%.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.530
So if you are a merchant--

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.180
Starbucks, the
Hillary campaign--

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.330
if you're a merchant
and you say,

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:28.430
I want to have less than
2.7%, I can have 1% fees.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.830
I want finality and I
don't want charge backs

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:34.070
depending upon which
side of this you're on.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.950
They're trying to just do
it as a lower cost solution.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.160
1%.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.110
Pria?

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:42.310
AUDIENCE: Similar story, but
maybe with a happy ending.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:42.883
So a lot--

00:54:42.883 --> 00:54:45.050
GARY GENSLER: Happier than
not winning the election?

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:47.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.480
AUDIENCE: So far a lot of
philanthropic organizations,

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.730
this is becoming
a very real issue.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.060
So the Silicon Valley
Community Foundation

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:58.340
recorded a 30% increase
in its endowment

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.460
due to digital assets donations.

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.240
And it's happening in a few
community foundations as well.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.490
It's a growing field
of interest, and there

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.690
even a story--

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:11.270
I mean, not a story,
It really happened--

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.820
of one of the exchanges
doing this service,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.440
converting the digital
donations into fiat currency,

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.760
and it crashed.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.820
Because the volume was just
so much they could not--

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.680
even the trickle they
could not keep up.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.860
But this is becoming
a real thing now.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.380
GARY GENSLER: And whether
it's a large foundation

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.390
or political campaign,
there's also a little bit

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:33.530
of reputational risk.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:38.540
Because you want to make
sure that the funds are not

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.000
illicit funds.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.070
So there's a little bit
of a reputational risk

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:45.847
that maybe a Starbucks
wouldn't have when you're just

00:55:45.847 --> 00:55:46.805
buying a cup of coffee.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:52.550
Never run a Starbucks, but--

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.310
So the crypto
exchanges and BitPay

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.320
sort of provide a
lot of services.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.960
E-wallet companies
provide services.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.560
Sean?

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.590
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious, how
does BitPay manage volatility?

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:05.120
How does it cash out?

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.290
GARY GENSLER: How does
it manage volatility?

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.440
AUDIENCE: So it only takes a 1%
cut of the transaction value,

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.470
but the volatility of
which can go over 1%

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.230
like every couple of seconds.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:17.660
So in that case,
how do they manage?

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.680
GARY GENSLER: So they
are arranged basically

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.040
with a number of
crypto exchanges.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.790
I once knew, but I
don't know whether they

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.370
have arrangements with
three, or five, or whatever.

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:31.460
And they basically are
pricing right at the--

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:35.810
so they have sort of close
to real time pricing.

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:39.140
So I'm going to buy
a cup of coffee.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.290
The way the technology works--

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:42.470
and let's say it's--

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:46.460
what's a Starbucks cup
of coffee, it's $5?

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.160
It's pretty expensive, isn't it?

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.810
AUDIENCE: Depending
on what you buy.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.573
GARY GENSLER: What's
your cup of coffee?

00:56:52.573 --> 00:56:53.240
AUDIENCE: $2.25.

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.070
GARY GENSLER: $2.25, all right.

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:58.580
But in real time, the app--

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.690
the BitPay app-- is
computing what that is.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:07.220
And they feel that within
these seconds for them

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:12.540
to convert at they
take volatility risk.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:17.500
Is it possible that
in some transactions

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.710
the volatility eats
up the whole 1%?

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.620
Yes.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:25.500
But basically they have
that in their pricing model.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:32.430
And then move basically
Pria's Bitcoin to dollars,

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.960
and the dollars
goes to Starbucks.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:45.580
And they guarantee
Starbucks $2.25 minus 1%.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:50.800
Then there's startups
actually getting in.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.240
But most of these--

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.980
at least the second,
third, and fourth--

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.060
are kind of
institutional services.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.730
Now, there might be retail
services that I'm not--

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.160
Qurom was started by JP Morgan.

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.300
I think it might even still
be owned by JP Morgan.

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.730
It was going to be spun out.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.790
But R3, Ripple, these
are really institutions.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:15.010
Almost B2B or financial firm
to financial firm right now.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:22.970
I couldn't find a really good
startup in the retail space,

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.400
but two weeks from
today you're going

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.050
to have Jeff Sprecher and
Kelly here, and you can--

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:32.340
Shrim, are you going to
be back on November 15th?

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:32.840
No?

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.690
But you'll be able to challenge.

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:37.340
They're going to have
a retail payments

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.340
system in their Bitcoin.

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.830
So it'll be interesting.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:46.820
One retail payment solution
is if anybody walks over

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:50.990
to building E14 there's a
vending machine in the media

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:53.920
lab right now that
takes Bitcoin.

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.270
Thank you, MIT.

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.760
Thank you, the digital
currency initiative.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.140
Thank you Alin.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.650
But there is literally--

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:05.320
if you want to describe
it, you put a QR code up?

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
so yes absolutely.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.340
So anyone who wants
to do that, we

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.690
can walk over there
and look at it.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.150
It has cross change
slots so we can

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.220
transact real time between
three different currencies.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:16.720
And--

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.345
GARY GENSLER: So you
can take Bitcoin--

00:59:18.345 --> 00:59:20.140
AUDIENCE: Litecoins,
and you know,

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.690
dummy US dollars we call it.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.067
But it's basically a stable
coin, it's a stable coin.

00:59:24.067 --> 00:59:25.150
GARY GENSLER: Stable coin.

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:28.540
So Bitcoin, Litecoin,
and a stable coin.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.000
And there's a vending machine
sitting in the media lab.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.462
You put a QR code
up, if I remember?

00:59:34.462 --> 00:59:36.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so QR
code on the machine.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:42.430
you scan, we published an
app on Android and iOS.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:46.240
And you basically scan your
home null or you computer,

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.280
you allow your phone to
control your computer,

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.080
and then you can send
money from your phone

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.180
to your vending machine.

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:53.090
Real time.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.215
GARY GENSLER: But in that
case, the vending machine

00:59:55.215 --> 00:59:56.640
receives the Bitcoin.

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.710
AUDIENCE: No, so we
actually added an arduino

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.860
as well that converts
the Bitcoin into impulses

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.650
that trick the machine
to say, these are coins.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.810
So the vending machine
actually gets--

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:08.410
we tell it--

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:09.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.305
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.000
Check it out over
in the media lab.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.840
It was rolled out for media
lab members' week, actually,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.110
two weeks ago.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:24.420
And then there's incumbents--

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.850
ICE's startup Bakkt.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:31.420
I do put MasterCard on
there, Sharim, I do.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.160
But it's remarkable how many
patents are being filed.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.900
Hundreds of patents
are being filed,

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.363
but they're almost
all by the incumbents.

01:00:39.363 --> 01:00:41.280
Now, is that because
they want to block others

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.530
from getting in, or are they
trying to create barriers

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:48.060
to entry, or are they doing it
because they see real prospect

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.550
and opportunity, and
they want to pursue it?

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.990
It's probably a bit of both.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.580
Larry, you're shaking your head.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.350
AUDIENCE: It's all
barriers to entry.

01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:00.333
GARY GENSLER: It's all barriers
to-- you don't think it's any?

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.000
AUDIENCE: No, it's
all barriers to entry

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.460
and then the
argument's like this.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.990
Our system's great,
and guess what?

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.710
The legal cost of
pursuing your system

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.510
is going to be
through the roof, so.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.500
GARY GENSLER: And we'll get
some patents along the way.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.216
AUDIENCE: No, those patterns
are the legal costs.

01:01:12.216 --> 01:01:13.190
That's the point.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.900
The threat of the
patent litigation

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.190
is enough to stop any--

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.620
so if you're a
venture capitalist,

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.240
then they walk in like you
make before your announcement,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.550
you're dead.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.080
GARY GENSLER: Well, Bank
of America has 43, so--

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.555
in the blockchain space, I read.

01:01:27.555 --> 01:01:28.930
AUDIENCE: This is
the strategy in

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:33.580
every major incumbent complex,
so it's nothing new here.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.330
GARY GENSLER: So is
it a sign that there's

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.310
something really real here?

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:42.260
That these startups might have
something to be figured out?

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:45.140
Visa's started a business
to business payment

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.410
connect in 2016.

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:49.490
They've even announced--
Visa's even outside it

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:51.080
hasn't had a lot of adoption.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.820
They're not sure.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.950
I think it's more permission
than permissionless,

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.390
by the way.

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.730
But this is kind of--

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.713
now, is anybody in their
own readings, maybe Alin--

01:02:01.713 --> 01:02:03.380
I mean, I'm not trying
to be exhaustive,

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.210
but there's not a lot of--

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.600
because of some of these
issues back here, these

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.720
are real challenges,
but I would say these

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.550
are real possibilities, too.

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:16.713
Kelly and then Alin?

01:02:16.713 --> 01:02:18.588
AUDIENCE: So what about
some of the companies

01:02:18.588 --> 01:02:19.760
that sort of backed out?

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.440
And I'm reading Stripe ended
their export [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.666
program.

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:30.290
It sounds like a pretty
defeated situation,

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:33.735
but I don't really understand
that much exactly why.

01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:38.140
GARY GENSLER: You want to
answer the Stripe question?

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.510
AUDIENCE: Yes, and
Stripe is not Bitcoin.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:44.405
Stripe wanted to maybe
use Bitcoin as a service.

01:02:44.405 --> 01:02:45.610
I mean, they're clients.

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:47.240
They're not the startup.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.630
So I think backing up is--

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.150
it makes sense because
they're clients.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:56.320
But there's many startups
out there that are still

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.390
here and not [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.500
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, and
just as background, Stripe

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.930
is a payment system provider.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:05.980
So they're not extending credit
like a Visa, or MasterCard,

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.800
or they're not a network
like Visa or MasterCard

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.930
where actually they
don't provide the credit,

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:11.690
the banks do.

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:15.220
But they are a payment
system provider

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.800
that merchants
would hire, Stripe,

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.140
to interface with
MasterCard, Discover,

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.180
American Express, and others.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:27.940
But why did Stripe decide
not to continue on this?

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.330
Partly they didn't see a lot
of adoption is what I took.

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:32.700
But Alin, you were going to--

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
just a couple of--

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:34.810
couple things I wanted to.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:35.810
So this is a great list.

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:37.780
I think it's a great
starting point.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:43.780
And the rule that I think at
some three months ago I had was

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.460
in the cryptocurrency space,
most non-speculation money--

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.650
so no like I'm going
to buy low, sell high--

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.920
is coming from either
exchanges or miners.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.513
So you got--

01:03:54.513 --> 01:03:55.930
GARY GENSLER:
Exchanges or mining.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:56.290
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.550
So that's where
the money's made.

01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.440
If you don't speculate,
you're either a miner

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.447
and you make money or
an exchanger make money.

01:04:01.447 --> 01:04:03.280
The miner down I think
would be interesting.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.933
I think I would put Bitmain over
there because I think it's--

01:04:05.933 --> 01:04:06.850
GARY GENSLER: Bitmain?

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:07.600
AUDIENCE: Bitmain.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.390
So Bitmain, for
those who don't know,

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.790
is going through an
ICO, an initial--

01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:13.810
sorry, IPO.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.470
Initial--

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:16.166
GARY GENSLER: Public offering.

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:19.682
A traditional [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:19.682 --> 01:04:21.140
AUDIENCE: They have
a lot of money,

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.070
there will be [INAUDIBLE]
a very hefty rate.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.830
They want to stop producing AI
chips, artificial intelligence

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.330
chips.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.310
So they're very good
at producing chips,

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:31.162
and they will go--

01:04:31.162 --> 01:04:32.370
they'll go into one of those.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.080
GARY GENSLER: But is Bitmain
in the payment space, using

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:35.950
blockchain for pay?

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.060
AUDIENCE: I mean, they've
invested in Circle,

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.158
which is another exchange,
so they're like--

01:04:40.158 --> 01:04:41.200
they have a lot of money.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.658
They're trying to kind of place
it towards other companies.

01:04:43.658 --> 01:04:46.812
So yeah, so exchanges
of the finance or all

01:04:46.812 --> 01:04:48.520
these other [INAUDIBLE],,
there are a lot

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.728
of exchanges that make money.

01:04:49.728 --> 01:04:50.811
And the other ones aren't.

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:52.645
GARY GENSLER: So I want
to talk a little bit

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:53.980
about cross-border.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.277
On Tuesday we put
up a complex chart.

01:04:56.277 --> 01:04:57.860
I don't need to go
through that again,

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.650
but we all know and there's
a lot of people here

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:00.900
that probably send money back.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.790
When you're moving
something overseas,

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:07.960
you're moving from one fiat
to another fiat currency,

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.730
it takes some time.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:12.370
And the banking
system over centuries

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:16.900
has formed a way to do that to
move from one money to another,

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.650
or as we say, one ledger system
to another ledger system,

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.150
through correspondent banking.

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:27.610
And correspondent banking
is a reasonably concentrated

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:28.960
business.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.110
One student sent
in the group chat

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:35.137
last night that there's only
really 10 banks in this field.

01:05:35.137 --> 01:05:36.970
I don't know if that's
accurate, by the way,

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.970
but it is a very
concentrated business

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.960
because they're large
international banks.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.780
Whether it's 10 or 20, it's--

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.590
you know, and they can charge
a little excess because they

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.060
have to have correspondence.

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.570
They have to have relationships
with all the local banks,

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:55.600
and they're taking some credit
risk-- the correspondent banks

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.020
standing in between-- some
credit risk of the local banks

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.590
on both sides in the
US and so forth and in,

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.900
let's say, Mexico if it's
between the US and Mexico.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.540
So one idea that's
been around, it's

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.150
widely associated with
Ripple but it's not only

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:15.880
associated with Ripple
is this simple chart.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.930
What if I move fiat to
crypto and crypto to fiat?

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:25.020
Just call it a bridge
crypto or bridge currency.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:30.150
I can say I can go from
US dollars to Bitcoin,

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:35.570
or XRP, you fill in
the middle, and then

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.720
move over to the other fiat--

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.200
Mexican peso, in my example.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.200
And might that take some
cost out of the system?

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.190
We have Sean's issue
earlier of volatility.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:55.920
If the crypto is fluctuating a
lot, that causes some issues.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.410
If there's a lot of
cost or friction,

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:03.480
because now you're doing two
currency exchanges not one.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.360
I'm calling crypto a
currency for this purpose.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:11.360
I know that crypto is not
technically a currency,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.220
but for this moment
let me just call it--

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.530
you have two currency
exchanges, and thus you

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:20.580
have two bid ask spreads to pay.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.920
Just the market makers
you need to pay the bid

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.370
ask spreads twice, and
you have some volatility

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.480
if the middle crypto
is moving around.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.050
But this simple
diagram is a big part

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:37.050
of what Ripple is trying
to create with xRapid.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:44.960
xCurrent is a messaging
app of Ripple's and it's

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.970
competing with Swift.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:50.450
And it had some
reasonable adoption.

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:53.110
A lot of banks are
starting to use it.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.140
But don't confuse that
with another product, which

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:59.500
is an interesting product that
kind of does this that goes

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.520
fiat to crypto, crypto to fiat.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.290
So what problem,
what pain points

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:09.840
would this be solving if it
worked in the cross border?

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.720
Anybody want to remind
the class what the--

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.220
Tom?

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.637
AUDIENCE: Well, this reduces
the number of intermediaries.

01:08:14.637 --> 01:08:17.550
You don't have to have your bank
engaged with a correspondence

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:21.330
bank, which engages with
a local bank, which then--

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.090
it sort of--

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.632
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so it might.

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:26.520
I'm going to say it might lower
the intermediation because you

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.580
still have on the two fiat sides
your local bank and a bank,

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.960
and to do the crosses you need
some market making function

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.790
which in Ripple's case they try
to build into the application.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.200
And they have market makers
to provide liquidity.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.300
There was a question
somebody mentioned liquidity.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.790
Some liquidity.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.073
But it might lower the
numbers of intermediaries.

01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:49.990
What else might it do?

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:56.899
AUDIENCE: There's usually
between exchanging currency

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.779
there's a balance between the
settlement time and the fee

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:00.350
that you pay.

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:03.740
So if you want quick settlement
you have to pay a higher fee,

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.950
or you can accept a lower fee
but it takes multiple days

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:08.899
sometimes to catch
over, so potentially it

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:09.812
could solve that.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.479
GARY GENSLER: So this
is basically a way

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.600
that you can shorten
the settlement times.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.784
This can be done
literally in seconds.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:23.189
I'm not saying that you wouldn't
pay a little extra for it,

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:26.729
but this can be
done very quickly.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.460
If you have arrangements.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.000
So some contend-- and I've
spoken to them at conferences

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.870
and so forth--

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:36.750
that big corporate treasuries
are going to try to do this--

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.069
that the treasury function
of Apple and others

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:41.840
might take this up.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.180
The big banks say
that's ridiculous.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.970
The big banks say,
no, we can provide

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:50.840
real-time cross-border cash
movement between dollar

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.840
and euro, and dollar
and yen, and you

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.016
don't need to interpose
something in the middle.

01:09:57.016 --> 01:10:01.370
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that require
huge amounts of cash reserves

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.520
to be able to protect
against volatility, and not

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.860
only volatility of the
crypto, but the volatility

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.930
of the actual fiat for that
particular country [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:13.970
GARY GENSLER: So the
question is, will it need

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:17.877
a lot of liquidity, basically?

01:10:17.877 --> 01:10:19.460
You used a different
word maybe, but--

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.360
AUDIENCE: Reserves.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.620
GARY GENSLER: Reserves.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:25.100
But somebody who can
make markets in size

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.980
in crypto versus fiat,
in crypto versus fiat,

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.560
I think the answer
is yes in terms of--

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.740
the only probably
token right now

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.130
that has enough liquidity
in it to do this in size

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.780
is probably Bitcoin.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.420
Even though Ripple
is promoting this

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.540
and it's sort of an
interesting technology,

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:49.140
they have a software, xRapid,
that you can do this right now.

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.360
They're promoting on XRP, but
is there enough liquidity?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.910
Could you move more
than a million dollars?

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.350
Probably not.

01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:59.840
You probably couldn't
move $100 million payment

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.606
without moving the market a lot.

01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:04.040
Shimon.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.775
AUDIENCE: So back to
finance, the only way--

01:11:06.775 --> 01:11:08.150
GARY GENSLER: So
back to finance,

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:09.800
that's good from a
finance professor.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.550
AUDIENCE: The only way
that this will work

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:14.810
is sort of subject to the cost
of arbitraging this, right?

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:18.770
You don't care about the value
of XRP provided that you're not

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:21.700
validating arbitrage
relationship between the two

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.020
fiats, right?

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.320
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.325
AUDIENCE: So whatever
those frictions are,

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:29.270
you won't be able to
go underneath them.

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.290
And if you're Apple, I
don't see the treasury

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.260
in a business case.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:39.500
If you're Apple and you're
banking with JP Morgan Chase,

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:45.710
I mean, they're probably
quoting you, you know, bips.

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.650
I mean, the two major
currencies, the spread

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:50.720
is like in bips.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.740
GARY GENSLER: A bip is
1/100 of a cent, basically.

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.710
I mean, it's very tiny.

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.250
We'll get there, just a second.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.260
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure that isn't the--

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.000
GARY GENSLER: So
the proponents--

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.660
and then we'll come back--
proponents of this say, yeah,

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.740
JP Morgan might solve Apple's
needs between dollar euro,

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:16.220
but are they really doing it
between dollar peso, or dollar

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.063
Kenyan currency?

01:12:19.063 --> 01:12:21.230
AUDIENCE: Let's say they're
not and the spread there

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:24.410
is 10 basis points,
50 basis points.

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:30.170
Well, that's going to be by
construction, the spread,

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:32.930
that's going to be [INAUDIBLE]
arbitrage that will be allowed

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:34.080
if you go that way to--

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.580
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so Shimon's

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.520
saying there's maybe
a cost in friction.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.650
I think the proponents
of this would also

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:46.910
say there's a friction in time
moving from dollars to peso.

01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:48.260
Remind me your first name?

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.360
AUDIENCE: My name's [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.947
Well, it's certainly true
even in pesos or any currency,

01:12:52.947 --> 01:12:54.780
like, all these points
that anyone's getting

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.940
are extremely tight.

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.190
But there's still probably
like weekends, for example.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:12:59.923
Weekends they're just
not quoted at all.

01:12:59.923 --> 01:13:01.340
So if there's a
major event that's

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.882
happening over a
weekend that's going

01:13:02.882 --> 01:13:05.600
to change the value of your
asset or your currency,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.730
then you can't trade
until Sunday night

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:10.080
when Hong Kong opens.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.150
And so there's still like
a 36-hour time period

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:16.880
that is completely [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.040
GARY GENSLER: So the
worldwide currency markets

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.780
are depending upon banks,
and banks do actually

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.395
have holidays.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.940
I know it's sometimes
hard to believe, but.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.210
And so there's a question of--

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.775
so there's a
question of friction

01:13:33.775 --> 01:13:35.900
which Shimon would say if
it's even if it costs you

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.660
half a percent it better
get inside of that.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.290
There's a question of settlement
delay, this could be faster.

01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.040
But you're saying they
could change that--

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.450
JP Morgan can change that.

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.740
And then there's weekends.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.080
Do you have 160 some hour week?

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.630
I'm going to go to
Alexis and back here.

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:59.310
AUDIENCE: I was just thinking
like-- because this system like

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.770
India at the end of
the day, it depends

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:05.040
on the a fixed rate
on the two fiat rate

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.260
on the normal markets, right?

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.410
So even if we can't
trade on a Sunday,

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:14.640
the rate is going to change
on the tax form based on,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.400
I don't know, the assumption
of what the rate is going to be

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.337
tomorrow.

01:14:18.337 --> 01:14:20.670
It's going to adjust, normally
you should adjust, right?

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:24.010
Because as has
been raised before,

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:27.130
adjust for new
arbitrage take place.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:31.830
So even if it's possible,
doesn't this system

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.790
add more risk in terms
of two different risk--

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.780
fiat-crypto, crypto-fiat?

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:40.965
And just there will always be
the underlying risk of fiat

01:14:40.965 --> 01:14:43.260
to fiat because
it's always based

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.050
on a price on the private--

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:46.800
GARY GENSLER: Hold
your question because I

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.630
want to see if the other--

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:49.530
yours comes in.

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:50.707
I got it, it's the risk.

01:14:50.707 --> 01:14:52.290
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to bring up

01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:56.910
the accessibility for
non-first world countries

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:58.550
or unbanked countries.

01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:03.180
And I would be less concerned
about moving like a yard

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.470
and more concerned about, OK,
well maybe I could transact

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.780
like sub-$100--

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.363
GARY GENSLER: Do you
want to translate

01:15:10.363 --> 01:15:11.760
for the room what a yard is?

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.890
My Goldman Sachs days
I knew what a yard is,

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:16.440
but some of the non-bankers.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.810
AUDIENCE: It's $1 billion.

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:19.170
GARY GENSLER: $1 billion.

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.787
Now you can work on--

01:15:20.787 --> 01:15:22.370
what trading floor
to did you work on?

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.960
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.460
Citi.

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.350
Now you can work on Citi.

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:26.490
A yard is $1 billion.

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:28.754
At Goldman Sachs it's floor 2.

01:15:28.754 --> 01:15:29.712
AUDIENCE: Yeah, oh boy.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.970
GARY GENSLER: We measured
it differently, yeah.

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:39.420
AUDIENCE: But I
think if you wanted

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:48.020
to transact maybe like under
$100 from dollars to whatever,

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.395
no large bank is going to open
an account and do that for you.

01:15:51.395 --> 01:15:52.770
You're going to
have to do that--

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.210
like a commercial bank,
if you have access to it,

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.940
there's a really
wide spread there.

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.380
So you can do this through
an app through a Stablecoin,

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.920
or Ripple, or
whatever, you're going

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.030
to be able to do it
for cheaper if you're

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:04.720
making like micro transactions.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.725
GARY GENSLER: So
I'm going to react

01:16:06.725 --> 01:16:08.850
and then trust bring it
all together and summarize.

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.610
It's the last slide, so.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.690
Alexis' point about
risk, I agree.

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:16.260
I think that all of these
points are valid that there

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.210
is additional cost.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:21.240
There's two hops
in this example,

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.010
and there's additional risks.

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:25.080
So the real business
case question

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.660
is, is there enough value
added on the other side?

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.340
Are you shortening
settlement cycles?

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.440
Can you do it on the
weekends when you otherwise

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.140
couldn't do it?

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:36.060
Could you move small dollar
amounts, maybe retail?

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.150
Because Western Union
still charges something

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:44.350
like 8% to 10% to do
cross-border remittances.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.970
So send some money
to the Philippines,

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.400
and do it only for a
couple of hundred dollars,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.350
and you're probably
spending 10%.

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:58.400
Could somebody build
inside of those types of--

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.000
now, $200 movement 10%'s $20.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.190
You still have to bring
transaction costs down--

01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:06.500
fixed transaction costs down.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.060
But if you can bring the fixed
transaction cost down and have

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.985
enough liquidity, it's kind of--

01:17:14.985 --> 01:17:17.630
I wouldn't count this out.

01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.490
I'm one who sort
of doubts it will

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.620
be in the heart of
treasury function

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:25.070
that Apple will be using
it between dollar and euro,

01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:28.940
but I want to say just
the wide spectrum and just

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:33.440
an interesting-- can crypto
be a bridge currency,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.770
and might it be in the
world of stable value?

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.840
I hope-- I mean, this
was a good discussion

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.160
because this is what the rest
of the semester is about.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.690
We're going to take use case
by use case and really debate,

01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:48.420
and through it the learning
objective is for all of us

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.580
to leave with a little
critical reasoning skills

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.730
about when does an
append-only log with consensus

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:57.360
amongst multiple parties and
maybe a native token make

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:57.990
sense?

01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:59.370
That's usually
called blockchain,

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:03.450
but Aline doesn't let me call it
blockchain technology anymore.

01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:09.030
Next Tuesday is election day,
so I'm going to make my pitch.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:10.842
If you're a US
citizen, please vote.

01:18:10.842 --> 01:18:12.300
If you're not, I'm
not going to ask

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.340
you to vote but please vote.

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:18.240
Participate in our incredible
thing called democracy,

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.010
but we're going to
talk about central bank

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:21.240
digital currencies.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.430
And so I think we're doing this
over two sessions, as well.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:26.910
So next Tuesday is going to
be a lot about central banking

01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:28.060
and so forth.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.220
So thank you.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.830
Happy anniversary, Bitcoin.

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:34.880

YEN-JIE LEE: So
during the class,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.660
I usually do a little vote
on the physical situation

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.450
we are interested in
to predict what will be

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.780
the outcome of the calculation.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.920
I think that is actually a very,
very interesting thing to do.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.490
First of all, that will attract
the attention of the students

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.650
that we are going
to do a prediction

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.740
of a physical situation.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.350
OK?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.080
So that's actually
the first purpose,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.420
to encourage participation
of the students into class.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.130
And then secondly, I can know
if the majority of the students

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.020
already know the outcome or not
by looking at the vote result.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.680
So if I have--

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.750
if I have my polarizer
orienting in this direction,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.170
can you predict what will happen
to the readout on the scope?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.220
Will I see signal or not?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.930
How many of you actually
think we will see signal

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.060
if I arrange that?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.560
The electromagnetic
wave is actually

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.730
pointing-- polarized in
the up and down direction.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.460
OK, one, two--

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.430
OK, only four people think so.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.390
How many of you think
nothing will change?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.090
I'm sorry, nothing will
be observed by the scope.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.600
OK, most of you
actually think so.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.660
So let's actually really
do the experiment.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.300
I choose to use an analog method
instead of clicker or support

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.470
with other technical tools.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.170
And that is because I
would like this process

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.600
to be as smooth as
I could achieve.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.630
So doing it by raising
your hand, first of all,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.980
they have to do a lot
more by raising your hand

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.550
instead of clicking a button.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.940
So that actually makes
a difference for them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.300
to focus on my question.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.910
OK.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.310
So secondly, I don't want
to do a automatic counting

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.740
because usually,
they provide a graph,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.880
and I have to switch back
and forth between graph

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.490
and my lectures or my
other lecture slides.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.640
And that usually
takes some time.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.780
And also, that
introduces interruptions

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780
during my lecture.

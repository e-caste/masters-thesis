CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
Last lecture, we

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.500 align:middle line:84%
introduced the notion of
the limit of a function

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c, which
we write limit x arrow

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
c, f of x equals L.
What does this mean?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
This means for all
epsilon positive,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
there exists a delta positive
such that for all x in S

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
satisfying 0 is less than x
minus c is less than delta,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.505 align:middle line:84%
we have that f of x minus
L is less than epsilon.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And we proved the following
theorem last time,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that if we have a set,
a cluster point of S--

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
so this is where we
look at limits and f

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
as a function from S to
R-- then the limit as x

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
goes to c of f of x equals L if
and only if for every sequence

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
x sub n converging to c, we
have f of x n, the new sequence,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:84%
converges to L. So this
theorem here connects limits

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of functions to what
we did previously,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
limits of sequences.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, using this
theorem, we'll get

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
analogs of theorems we
proved for sequences, but now

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.255 align:middle line:90%
for limits.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.475 align:middle line:84%
First, let me show a few simple
applications of this theorem.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we could
prove the following--

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that for all c in R, the limit
as x goes to c of x squared

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
equals c squared.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.505 align:middle line:84%
So we could have done this
using just the definition,

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
but now with this
theorem, we can

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
prove it a little bit
quicker and easier,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
because we essentially
did all the hard work when

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
we proved that the product
of two convergent sequences

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
is convergent, which
is what we'll use here.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove
this theorem using

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
the previous theorem.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:90%
So let x n--

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
so for this theorem,
since it's not stated,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
you should take the function
to be f of x equals x squared.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the set that is
defined on S is equal to R

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So let x n be a sequence such
that x n converges to c as n

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:90%
goes to infinity.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We now want to
show that f of x n

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
converges to f of c, where
f of x equals x squared.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But this follows from
what we proved for limits.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So we proved the product
of two convergent sequences

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
is convergent.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
By earlier theorem
about the product

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of convergent sequences, we
get that x n squared converges

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:90%
to c squared, which implies--

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
so we've now verified for
every sequence converging

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to c, f of x n,
meaning x n squared,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:90%
converges to c squared.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore by the
previous theorem,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:90%
we've proven the claim.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.415 align:middle line:84%
So now let's use this term to
study a couple of more limits.

00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And we use this
theorem, in fact,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to show that a certain
limit does not exist.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So the limit as x goes
to 0 of sine 1 over x--

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:90%
this limit does not exist.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So remember for a limit,
I look at all those points

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
x that are close to
c, but not equal to c.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So this function, which
I'm taking the limit

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to 0 of,
doesn't need to be

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
defined at x equals 0 in
order to consider the limit.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you like,
the function sine

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
of 1 over x is defined on
S equals R take away 0.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So this limit does not
exist, but the limit

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to 0 of x times
sine of 1 over x does

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:90%
exist and equals 0.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to
note something--

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
you can't just stick in x equals
0 here to evaluate the limit.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Because then you'll be taking
sine of 1 over 0 times 0.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't divide by 0, so
can't just say this limit

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 because I
stick in x equals 0.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we saw in
the previous lecture

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that the limit need not
equal the function evaluated

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So just to recall the
example from last time,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
when I had f of x equals 1 if
x equals 0 and 2 if x does not

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
equal to 0, then we
showed that limit

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to 0 of f of
x equals 2, which note,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%
does not equal f of 0.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:84%
When we discuss
continuity, that's

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
what connects the limit
to the function evaluated

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.553 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:06:33.553 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make
that little comment.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.135 align:middle line:84%
To prove this theorem,
we're going to use, again,

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%
the previous theorem.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should-- no, I'm
not going to label it.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You'll know when
I point up to it

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that I'm referring to that
theorem that I stated up there.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, let's
prove the second limit

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:90%
exists and equals 0 first.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So suppose x n is a
sequence converging to 0.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:24.087 align:middle line:84%
We now want to show that
x sub n times sine of 1

00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
over x sub n converges to 0.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the previous
theorem up there

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
will imply that
the limit as x goes

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to 0 of x times sine
of 1 over x equals 0.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I look at the absolute
value of x sub n times

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:84%
sine of 1 over x sub n, this
is equal to the absolute value

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n times the
absolute value of sine of 1

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:90%
over x sub n.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
you stick into sine,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
sine is always bounded
between 1 and minus 1.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So the absolute value
is always bounded by 1.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So just to summarize,
we've shown that--

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and now we apply
the squeeze theorem.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So that goes to 0.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just the constant
sequence equal to 0.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Since x sub n is
converging to 0--

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:90%
remember we're assuming that--

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
this converges to 0.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.699 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what gets
trapped in between goes to 0.

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.707 align:middle line:84%
So by squeeze theorem,
x sub n times sine of 1

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
over x sub n converges to 0.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And that proves the second claim

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:90%
So now we'll prove 1.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the previous lecture,
I did negate this definition.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's actually
negate this theorem,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
if you like, or use the
negation of each side of this if

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and only if to state
an equivalent theorem.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So two statements
are equivalent,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
which is in that theorem, if
and only if their negations

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%
are also equivalent.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So by the theorem, we also
have the following fact--

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
limit x goes to c of f
of x is not equal L if

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.307 align:middle line:90%
and only if there exist--

00:10:03.307 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
so negating the right-hand side
of that if and only if-- there

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.045 align:middle line:84%
exists a sequence x
n converging to c--

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
so this sequence will--

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
consisting of elements
of S take away

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
c, such that x n
converges to c, but we

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
don't have f of x n converging
to L. And when I write this,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
you should read this as either
this limit exists and does not

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.875 align:middle line:84%
equal L or this
limit does not exist.

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'll even write that out--

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and either limit does
not exist or does not

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
equal L. So again,
that's an equivalent

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
way of stating the
theorem up there

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:90%
is in terms of the negation.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Two statements are equivalent,
which is right there, if

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and only if their
negations are equivalent.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going to prove
that the limit as x goes

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to 0 of sine of
1 over x does not

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
exist by showing that there
exists a sequence converging

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
to 0 such that when I
plug that in to sine,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.015 align:middle line:84%
the limit of that
sequence does not exist.

00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So to show there exists
a sequence converging

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to 0 such that limit as n
goes to infinity of sine of 1

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%
over x sub n does not exist.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, sine oscillates
between 1 and minus 1

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
depending on a certain
multiple of pi over 2.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
intuition behind it,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
behind the sequence
I'm about to give you--

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
note that sine of x equals
1 if x equals pi over 2,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
5 pi over 2, 9 pi over 2,
and so on, minus 1 if x

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:84%
equals 3 pi over 2, 7 pi over
2, 11 pi over 2, and so on.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So I can stick in things
that are getting bigger

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to sine and get 1 or minus 1.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, let me
change this to y,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
since we're using x to
be essentially 1 over y.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So if I stick in pi over 2, 5 pi
over 2, 9 pi over 2, and so on,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I get sine equals 1.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
If it's 3 pi over 2, 7
pi over 2, 11 pi over 2,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and I stick that into
sine, I get minus 1.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But that means if I stick
1 over these numbers

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:84%
into sine of 1 over
x, I get 1 or minus 1.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then that
sequence that I get

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
will be 1 or minus
1 alternating.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know that sequence
does not converge.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:90%
So let me write that down.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Let x sub n be 1 over
these numbers, essentially,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
so 2n minus 1, pi
over 2, minus 1,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.557 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
stick this into sine of 1

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
over x, which is 2 over
2n minus 1 over pi.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, note for all n, x sub
n is less than or equal to--

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I can write this as 2
over n plus n minus 1 pi.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And since n is bigger
than or equal to 1,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
this is always bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or
equal to 2 over n pi.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And this goes to 0.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So that shows by
the squeeze theorem

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
that this sequence I've
defined here converges to 0.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
I plug this sequence

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:90%
into sine of 1 over x?

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:18.595 align:middle line:84%
This is now equal to sine
of 2n minus 1 pi over 2.

00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is therefore
equal to 1 minus 1,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:90%
1, minus 1, 1, minus 1.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And this sequence, which
is just equal to minus 1

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.545 align:middle line:90%
to the n plus 1--

00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I capitalized
that-- does not converge.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So we found a sequence
converging to 0 such

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that when I stick it
into the function,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
that new sequence
does not converge.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven that this
limit does not exist.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:41.506 align:middle line:84%
So I alluded to this fact
that this theorem will give us

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
theorems that are
similar to what

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we proved for sequences, except
now for limits of functions.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just state the
simplest theorem you can get.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So let S be a subset of
R, c a cluster point of S,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and suppose I have two
functions f going from S to R

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and g going from S to R.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
If these two limits
exist, and one function

00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is smaller than
the other, then--

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
so we had an analogous
statement for sequences,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
which was if I have two
sequences converging

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and one is less than
or equal to the other,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
then one limit is less
than or equal to the other.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's an analogous conclusion
for limits of functions.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, the analogous
statement for sequences

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
was we have two
sequences, one less than

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the other, which
then the limit of the smaller

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
sequence is less than or equal
to the limit of the bigger

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:90%
sequence.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's give the proof.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use this theorem
connecting limits of functions

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:90%
to limits of sequences.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll use the
corresponding statement

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
which we do have for
sequences, which I just

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:90%
stated a couple of times.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So let L1 be the
limit as x goes to c

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
of f of x, and L2 the limit
as x goes to c of g of x.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.025 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to show is that
L1 is less than or equal to L2.

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Let x n be the sequence,
and S takeaway c such

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:90%
that x n converges to c.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Such a sequence exists because
c is a cluster point of s.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And you proved in the assignment
that if I have a cluster

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
point of S, then there exists
a sequence in S takeaway c

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
that converges to c.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, since-- say it this
way-- by the previous theorem,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
this limit equals L1, this
limit equals L2 if and only

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
if for every sequence converging
to c, f of x n converges to L1,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.955 align:middle line:90%
g of x n converges to L2.

00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
By the previous theorem,
we then conclude

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that L1 is equal to the
limit as n goes to infinity--

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
actually getting ahead
of myself a little bit.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's pause right
there and reset.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
sequence converging to c.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Then by the assumption
here for all n, f of x n

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to g of x n.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And since f of x
n converges to L1,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and g of x n converges
to L2, we get by, again,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:84%
this theorem about sequences,
which says if I have two

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
sequences, f of x sub n-- this
is one sequence is less than

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
or equal to another
sequence, g of x n--

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and they both converge,
then the limits

00:22:46.320 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
satisfy the same
inequality, which

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:90%
is what we wanted to prove.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So like I said,
this theorem here

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:90%
follows from the analogous--

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I should have
written this out or in fact,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
I will write it out now.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:51.035 align:middle line:84%
So the analogous statement for
sequences was if for all n,

00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
a n is less than or
equal to b n, then limit

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity, assuming
both limits exist, satisfy

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the same inequality.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is an analogous
theorem to this theorem,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
which we had for sequences.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And we used this theorem
from sequences to prove it.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, following that
same philosophy,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
you can prove
analogous statements

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
for functions,
limits of functions,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:90%
as you did from sequences.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You get these for free.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And instead of stating
all of the theorems we

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:84%
did for sequences except
now for limits of functions,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to quickly
say you get the same thing.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So by using the
previous theorem, which

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
connects convergence
of functions

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to convergence of sequences, we
have analogous theorems for--

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.485 align:middle line:90%
and let me state it this way--

00:25:23.485 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
for limits of functions now.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And for example, you
have the squeeze theorem,

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:90%
namely if I have--

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:84%
so just talking this out--
if I have three functions,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:84%
say f is less than or
equal to g is less than

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
or equal to h, and f of x
and this converges to L,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
h of x converges to L,
then g of x converges to L.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what I mean by
analogous statement.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
You also have theorems
about algebraic operations

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and limits, meaning that if
I have two functions that

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:84%
have limits as x goes
to c, then f plus g will

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:90%
have a limit as x goes to c.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And the limit of the sum
is the sum of the limits.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:46.587 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the product, and
same thing with the quotient,

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
assuming the limit on
the bottom is nonzero.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And then similarly,
we also have a theorem

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
about the absolute value
and limits, namely if f of x

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
converges to L as x goes to c,
then the absolute value of f

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
of x converges to the absolute
value of L as x goes to c.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So you have all of these
analogous statements,

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
or theorems that are analogous
to the statements from what

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
we did for sequences, but
now for limits of functions

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:90%
as x goes to c.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to state them all.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see this
in the textbook.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the proof of some of
them I'll give as exercises.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Now let's separate
the notion of a limit

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of a function from that of a
sequence just a little bit.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So unlike when we talk
about limits of sequences,

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
here we're letting a point
x converge or get close

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
to a point c, but
there's two ways

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
it can get close to c
on the real number line.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It can converge
to c from the left

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or it can converge
to c from the right.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.302 align:middle line:84%
And this leads to the notion
of left and right limits

00:28:16.302 --> 00:28:16.885 align:middle line:90%
of a function.

00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So start the definition here
and we'll go to the next board--

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
so let S be a subset
of R, and suppose c

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is a cluster point
of minus infinity,

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:90%
0 intersect of c intersect S.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm defining
now is the notion

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
of a function
converging to something

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:90%
as x goes to c from the left.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm looking at only
S intersect minus infinity to c.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm only looking
to the left of c.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
We say f of x converges to L as
x converges to c from the left

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:84%
by putting a minus sign up here
if a similar definition as that

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of the limit, but
now we only look

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
at x getting close
to c from the left.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
If for all epsilon
positive there

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
exists a delta positive
such that for all

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
x in S satisfying c minus delta
is less than x is less than c--

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's close to c
but to the left of c--

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
we have that f of x minus
L is less than epsilon.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
we write the limit

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c with the minus
sign up top, f of x equals L.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we have an
analogous definition

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
for converging to or taking
a limit of a function

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:90%
as x goes to c from the right.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
If c is a cluster
point of c infinity,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.037 align:middle line:90%
c comma infinity intersect S--

00:31:24.037 --> 00:31:24.995 align:middle line:90%
so I shouldn't say if--

00:31:24.995 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.285 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] is a cluster
point of, now just taking S

00:31:32.285 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that's to the right of c, then
we say that f of x converges

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to L as x converges to c plus,
meaning as x converges to c

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
from the right, if for all
epsilon positive there exists

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
a delta positive such that for
all x in S satisfying c is less

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:84%
than x is less
than c plus delta--

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
so now it's close to c
but to the right of c--

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
we have that f of x minus
L is less than epsilon.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And similarly to the
notation up there,

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we write limit as x goes to
c plus of f of x equals L.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, just like we proved
this theorem for limits,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:84%
you can state and prove
an analogous statement

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:90%
for one-sided limits.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So such a statement
would be, for example,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
limit as x goes to c
minus of f of x equals L

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
if and only if
for every sequence

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:84%
x sub n satisfying x sub n is
less than c converging to c,

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:84%
we have f of x n converges to L.
So these two just kind of limit

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
how f behaves near a
point c if we're just

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
looking to the left of c or to
the right of c, but not at c.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:90%
So let's, for example, look at--

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.975 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.975 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I think this is usually referred
to as the heavy side function.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So f of x equals 0 for x
less than or equal to 0,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and 1 if x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:90%
So the graph is like that.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And why do people care
about this function?

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a certain sense,
if you take the derivative

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
of this function, you get
what's called the Dirac delta

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
function, although
that's not a function.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a distribution.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But that's why this
function has a name attached

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:84%
to it because if you
take its derivative,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
you get something
somewhat special.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we're not
even at derivatives.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
We're not even going to
talk about distributions

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:90%
in this class.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back
to one-sided limits.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at this function
for x close to 0 from the left,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.140 align:middle line:90%
f is just 0.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, since I'm only
looking at x to the left of 0

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
in this limit, this is just
plugging in x less than 0,

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:90%
so I get 0.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's just 0.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And if I look at this
function from the right,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to the right of 0,
then f of x is just 1.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just 1 identically.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I get--

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's, again,
although I haven't

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:84%
shown that one-sided limits of
constants equal to constant,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that should be
something you can easily

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:90%
believe or write out yourself.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So for this function,
we see that it

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.910 align:middle line:84%
does have two-sided limits,
except those limits don't

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:90%
equal each other.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly don't equal--
so this one does equal f of 0,

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.697 align:middle line:84%
but I could have made
f of 0 to be a 1/2,

00:35:52.697 --> 00:35:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and then this still
would have been 0,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and not equal to the function
evaluated at the point.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm making this point
that for limits, just limits,

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
it does not matter what the
function is doing at the point.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Limit only cares
about how a function

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.705 align:middle line:90%
behaves near a a point.

00:36:12.705 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:84%
One-sided limits
augment that by saying

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
we're only going to care about
the function near the point

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and to the left
for the left limit,

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and to the right
for the right limit.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't say that, but
this we call the left limit,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.330 align:middle line:84%
this we call the
right limit, simply

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:84%
because we're getting
close to c from the right

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and from the left.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But what is the connection
between left and right limits?

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:90%
We have the following--

00:36:55.030 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.720 align:middle line:84%
let S be a subset of R, f
be a function from S to R,

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and suppose that c
is a cluster point

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of both sets minus
infinity to c intersect S.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And c infinity
intersect S. That way

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about the left and
right limits of c or at c.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Then-- so first off,
if c is a cluster

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:84%
point of any one
of these sets, it's

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be a cluster
point of the set S.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
look at the limit.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So then the limit
as x goes to c of f

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of x exists and
equals L if and only

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
if the limit as x goes to
c from the left of f of x

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:10.110 align:middle line:84%
equals the limit as x goes to c
from the right of f of x equals

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:18.250 align:middle line:90%
L.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of looks
like the theorem

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
we proved about lim
sup and lim inf,

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
any connection.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make some
connection between the way

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:84%
this theorem looks and the
statement of the theorem

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
for lim inf and lim sup, so this
is kind of saying that limit

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.240 align:middle line:84%
of a function equals L if
we approach from the left

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or right the function
f approaches L.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And for the lim sup lim inf
guy that we did for sequences,

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:84%
you could take that as saying
that the limit of a sequence

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.630 align:middle line:84%
equals L if and
only if following

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the sequence from below,
that approaches L,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and following the sequence from
above, that also approaches L.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.448 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind
of two directions

00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
there, just as there's
two directions here,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:90%
but not really.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's give a quick
proof of this theorem.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult. It
follows almost immediately

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:90%
from the definitions.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going to
do only one direction.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So this direction should,
assuming this, and proving

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.810 align:middle line:90%
this should be pretty clear.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:13.385 align:middle line:84%
If I have this, this means that
if I want to be close to L,

00:40:13.385 --> 00:40:15.435 align:middle line:90%
I just need to be close to c.

00:40:15.435 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
doesn't matter if I'm

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:84%
close to c from
the left or right.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll be close to L.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And going this
direction, this says

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I just need to be close
to c from the left,

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.520 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently close,
and I need to be

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:84%
close to c from the
right, sufficiently close,

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.510 align:middle line:84%
to be close to L.
So really, there's

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:42.170 align:middle line:84%
not a lot of trickiness
in the proof.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just writing
these things out.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just going to
write out one direction

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and leave the other
direction to you.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that
the left limit equals

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the right limit
equals L. And now we

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
want to show that
the limit as x goes

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:84%
to c of f of x equals L.
Now we want to show limit

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.890 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c of
f of x equals L.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
to the definition.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:32.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to
find delta so that f of x

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:37.085 align:middle line:84%
is within epsilon to L if
x is within delta to c.

00:41:37.085 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And what's the point?

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's c and here's L.
So this is the picture

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.370 align:middle line:90%
that goes along with this.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Assuming these two
limits equal L,

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
exists a delta 1 so

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:06.732 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm in this
interval, then here's

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:90%
L plus epsilon, L minus epsilon.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Then if I'm within delta
1 to c and to the left,

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:84%
then f will be close
to L in that interval.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And then since the limit as x
goes to c from the right equals

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
L, there exists some delta 2
so that if I'm in this interval

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be, again, close to L.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:52.115 align:middle line:84%
But this means that if I choose
the smaller of these two,

00:42:52.115 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and I look at the
whole interval,

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:84%
then f will be close to
L on the whole interval.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Then limit as x goes to
c minus f of x equals

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:14.420 align:middle line:84%
L, this implies there
exists delta 1 positive such

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that if x minus c is
less than delta 1, then

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I get that f of x c minus delta
1 is less than x is less delta

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:90%
is less than c.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:84%
This implies that f of x
minus L is less than epsilon.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And similarly for
the right limit,

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:84%
since limit as x goes to
c plus of f of x equals L,

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:84%
this implies, by the definition,
there exists a delta 2 positive

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:08.270 align:middle line:84%
such that if c is less than x
is less than c plus delta 2,

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:84%
then I get f of x minus
L is less than epsilon.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Now choose delta to be the
minimum of delta 1 and delta 2.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.295 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll now show
that this delta works.

00:44:31.295 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.655 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
show this delta works.

00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.820 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So if less than delta, then
this implies that either x

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.745 align:middle line:90%
is in c minus delta--

00:45:07.745 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.640 align:middle line:84%
so if we take something
close within delta

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to c, and delta is the minimum
of these two distances, then--

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.780 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of this
picture, let's say

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.110 align:middle line:84%
delta 1 equals delta 2, so now
I'm looking at this interval--

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:90%
then two cases.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Either x is in c
minus delta c, which

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.360 align:middle line:84%
is a subset of c minus
delta 1 c since delta

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is the minimum of those
two deltas, which implies

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:84%
by the first inequality here
for delta 1 or x is in c, c

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
plus delta, which
is a subset of c, c

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:09.340 align:middle line:84%
plus delta 2, which by
our choice of delta 2

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.090 align:middle line:90%
gives us that.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Thus we've shown that if x
minus c is less than delta,

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.880 align:middle line:84%
then f of x minus L
is less than epsilon.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of the proof.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've said this
over and over again--

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.290 align:middle line:84%
limits of functions don't care
about what the function is

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:37.235 align:middle line:90%
doing at the point.

00:46:37.235 --> 00:46:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It cares about what the function
is doing near the point.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to discuss
the notion of continuity,

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:58.360 align:middle line:84%
which connects the limit
of a function at a point

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:90%
to the function.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So it connects how
a function behaves

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.480 align:middle line:84%
near a point to the function
evaluated at the point.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you can even
write this down.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:33.670 align:middle line:84%
How a function behaves
near a point compared to--

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.285 align:middle line:90%
so near, at.

00:47:43.285 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see when I write
down the definition, basically,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.390 align:middle line:84%
what's staring
you in the face is

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that the definition
of continuity

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is that the limit as x goes
to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.495 align:middle line:84%
So we had these examples
where the limit--

00:48:07.495 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I think already erased it,
but where the limit exists

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.090 align:middle line:90%
but does not equal f of c.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And here for continuity,
the notion of continuity

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.560 align:middle line:84%
is that the limit as x goes
to c of f of x actually

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.210 align:middle line:84%
equals the function
evaluated at that point.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
following definition.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Let S be a subset of R
and c an element of S.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:84%
We say f is continuous at c
if for all epsilon positive,

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.840 align:middle line:84%
there exists a
delta positive such

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that for all x and S satisfying
x minus c is less than delta--

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.740 align:middle line:84%
so in particular, I
can now, for example,

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.230 align:middle line:84%
x equals c will satisfy
this inequality.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the 0
is less than that.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So for all x and S which
are close to c within delta,

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.435 align:middle line:90%
I have that f of x will be--

00:49:27.435 --> 00:49:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.070 align:middle line:90%
with an epsilon of f of c.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
just a little f is

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:54.240 align:middle line:84%
continuous at every point on its
domain that we're considering.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.860 align:middle line:90%
We just say f is continuous.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So for a function to be
continuous at a point nearby

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:33.190 align:middle line:84%
x, x being near c,
should mean that f of x

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.900 align:middle line:90%
should be near f of c.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.863 align:middle line:84%
And let's go through
some examples.

00:50:44.863 --> 00:50:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, whenever
you get a definition,

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you should look for examples
and then potentially negate it.

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll negate this
definition in just a second

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to show that a function
I wrote down a minute ago

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.000 align:middle line:90%
is not continuous.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So the affine function f of
x equals a times x plus b--

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:84%
so S is R, so x
is a real number--

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is a continuous
function, meaning

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.260 align:middle line:84%
it's continuous at
every real number c.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.265 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove this.

00:51:34.265 --> 00:51:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Let c be an element of R.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We want to show f
is continuous at c.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.874 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
through the definition.

00:51:46.874 --> 00:51:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Choose delta to be epsilon over
1 plus the absolute value of a.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And last time, in
the previous lecture,

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I gave the intuition on why you
would choose this delta based

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:90%
on the function and epsilon.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.113 align:middle line:90%
I did a computation here.

00:52:13.113 --> 00:52:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
choose delta this way,

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see that it works.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
show this delta works.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
If x minus c is
less than delta, we

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:27.590 align:middle line:84%
should be able to now show
that f of x minus f of c

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.465 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:52:28.465 --> 00:52:32.410 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:35.850 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to a x
plus b minus a c plus b.

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:39.692 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to
a times x minus c,

00:52:39.692 --> 00:52:42.680 align:middle line:84%
which equals absolute value
of a times absolute value

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of x minus c.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:49.240 align:middle line:90%
This is less than delta.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Absolute value of x minus c
is less than delta times a,

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.990 align:middle line:84%
which equals the absolute
value of a over 1

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.110 align:middle line:84%
plus the absolute value
of a times epsilon,

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.350 align:middle line:90%
which is less than epsilon.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because a number over
1 plus that number

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is always less than 1.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:11.457 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.457 --> 00:53:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were
wondering, why didn't I

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.381 align:middle line:84%
just choose delta to be epsilon
over the absolute value of a?

00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:20.300 align:middle line:84%
This is just a smidgen
of sophistication,

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that what happens if
the absolute value of a

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 0?

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Then we would have divided by 0.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So adding a 1 there
takes care of that.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So this guy is
continuous at every c.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:90%
So this function is continuous.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:58.105 align:middle line:84%
How about a function that's
not continuous at a point?

00:53:58.105 --> 00:54:04.080 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Make sure this is
the next topic.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.615 align:middle line:90%
Here is a non-example.

00:54:21.615 --> 00:54:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The function f of x, which
equals 1 if x equals 0,

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:90%
2 if x is not equal to 0.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:43.462 align:middle line:90%


00:54:43.462 --> 00:54:44.295 align:middle line:90%
That's the function.

00:54:44.295 --> 00:54:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:55.585 align:middle line:90%
f is not continuous at 0.

00:54:55.585 --> 00:54:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So to prove this, let's negate
the definition of continuity.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So the negation
of continuity is--

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:90%
so f is not continuous at c if--

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:25.960 align:middle line:84%
so the "for alls" become "there
exists," and "there exists"

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.830 align:middle line:90%
become "for all."

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So if there exists
some bad epsilon

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:43.440 align:middle line:84%
so that for all delta
positive, there exist an x such

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that x minus c is
less than delta,

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:59.757 align:middle line:84%
and we do not have the second
inequality, f of x minus f of c

00:55:59.757 --> 00:56:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to this bad epsilon.

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Now for this guy, it's pretty
clear which x to choose.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's think this
out for a minute.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.060 align:middle line:84%
There should be some
bad epsilon 0 so

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that if I take any
small interval around 0,

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I can find a point
in this interval

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:31.220 align:middle line:84%
so that f of x minus
f of c is going

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:84%
to be bigger than or
equal to epsilon 0.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Now here, f of c is
f of 0, which is 1.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Now what would be the bad
epsilon so that f of 1

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.260 align:middle line:84%
is greater than distance 1 or
greater than distance epsilon 0

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to f of x for some
x in this interval?

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I take any x in
this interval other than 0,

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and stick it into f,
I'm going to get 2.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's greater than or
equal to distance 1 to f of 0.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So epsilon 0 I will
choose to be 1.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we want to prove that
f, this function here, is not

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:23.220 align:middle line:90%
continuous at 0.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you what
the bad epsilon is.

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Choose epsilon 0 equals 1.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to show this
bad epsilon 0 is indeed bad.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Let delta be positive.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to now find a
number in this interval

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:46.230 align:middle line:84%
so that f of x minus f of 0
is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And like I said a minute ago, if
you take any x in this interval

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.810 align:middle line:84%
other than 0 and
stick it into f,

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:55.725 align:middle line:84%
I get 2, which is
distance 1 to f of 0.

00:57:55.725 --> 00:58:00.660 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Let x to be delta over 2, say.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Then x minus 0 is
less than delta.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:16.050 align:middle line:84%
It's actually equal
to delta over 2.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And f of x minus f of 0--

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:27.440 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to 2 minus 1,
which is bigger than or equal

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.960 align:middle line:90%
to epsilon 0.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So this function
is not continuous.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so next time-- and I'll
just leave this question here,

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.980 align:middle line:84%
which we'll address
in the next lecture.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's a kind of
simple question.

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So first off, if you
look at this function,

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.070 align:middle line:84%
it shouldn't be too hard
to convince yourself,

00:58:53.070 --> 00:59:00.240 align:middle line:84%
so you're also told when you
were a child that a function is

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.920 align:middle line:84%
continuous If you
can draw the graph

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and not lift up the pencil,
which I better not see

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.500 align:middle line:84%
on the exam if I ask
you about continuity.

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, for the sake
of this conversation,

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:15.750 align:middle line:84%
let's take that
as the intuition.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can convince yourself
that this function is

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.970 align:middle line:90%
continuous over here, though.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:24.170 align:middle line:84%
If I'm getting close to--
let's say this is minus 1,

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.790 align:middle line:84%
then the function is
getting close to 2.

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.638 align:middle line:84%
And the value of the
function at minus 1 is 2.

00:59:32.638 --> 00:59:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So the function is getting close
to the value of the function

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.290 align:middle line:90%
at minus 1.

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:39.575 align:middle line:84%
And the same for if I'm
looking at c equals 1.

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So you should be able
to convince yourself

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that this function is
continuous at every point

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.810 align:middle line:90%
other than at the origin 0.

00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So a natural question to ask is,
let f be a function, let's say,

00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.135 align:middle line:84%
defined on the whole
real number line.

01:00:00.135 --> 01:00:03.980 align:middle line:90%


01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Does there exist
a point in R such

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that f is continuous
at this point c?

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
For this example over
here, we were able to--

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.490 align:middle line:84%
any point other than 0, the
function's continuous there.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So natural question
is, let's say

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I take an arbitrary function.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to have a
point where it's continuous?

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And next time, we'll
see that answer is no.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll give an example
that's I think

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
due to Dirichlet because
it's named after him,

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
but naming doesn't necessarily
mean anything in math.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Green's theorem is named after
Green but he didn't prove it,

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
so maybe it was due
to somebody else.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use a similar
characterization of continuity

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of analogous
to this first statement we

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
had for limits.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And we'll do that next time.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:09.790
PROFESSOR: Square well.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.260
So what is this problem?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.110
This is the problem of having a
particle that can actually just

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.590
move on a segment, like it
can move on this eraser,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.180
just from the left to the right.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.110
It cannot escape here.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.860
So the way we represent
it is the interval 0

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.790
to a on the x-axis.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.164
And there's going to be two
walls, one wall to the left

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:49.510
and one wall to the right,
and no potential in between.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:00.837
That is, I write the potential
V of x as 0, for x in between a

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:09.190
and 0, and infinity for x
less than or equal to 0,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.330
and x greater than
or equal to a.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.120
So basically the particle
can move from 0 to a,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.260
and nowhere else.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.270
The potential is infinity.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.680
Now, this problem, meaning
that the wave function--

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.470
the particle cannot be
outside the interval,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.560
means that the wave
function must vanish outside

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.400
the interval.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.530
And you could say,
how do you know?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.800
Well, if the potential is close
to infinite amount of energy

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.150
to be there, so the particle
cannot really be there

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.585
if it's really infinite
energy that you need.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:02.530
You will see in the finite
square well that the particle

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.870
has probability to be in regions
where it classically cannot be.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.970
But that probability will go to
0 if the potential is infinite.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.370
So we can think of it as a limit
and we will reconfirm that.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.710
But in fact, if the
potential is infinity,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:29.020
we will take it to mean that
psi of x is equal to 0 for x

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.715
less than 0 and for
x greater than a.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
I am putting this equals or--

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.560
there are many
ways of doing this.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.250
If this function,
as this continues,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.550
you have a wall at a,
is the potential 0 at a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.820
or is it infinity?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.860
Well it doesn't quite matter.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.560
The issue is that the
wave function is 0 here,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.620
is 0 there, and we've
said that the wave

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.720
function must be continuous.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.650
So it should be 0 by that
time you're at 0 or at a.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.645
So therefore we will
take psi of 0 to be 0,

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:22.600
and psi of a to be
0 by continuity.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.570
So we discuss why the wave
function has to be continuous.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.140
If the wave function
is not continuous,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.480
the second derivative
of the wave function

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.510
is terribly singular.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.490
It's like a derivative of
a delta function, which

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.910
is an impossible situation.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.070
So the wave function,
we will take

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.860
it to vanish at
these two places,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.260
and this is what is
called a hard wall.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.960
So what is the
Schrodinger equation?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.745
The Schrodinger equation is,
again, a free Schrodinger

00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:15.460
equation.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.300
Nothing, no potential here,
so it's the same Schrodinger

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:29.790
equation we had there, psi
double prime equals minus 2mE

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.180
over h squared, psi of x.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.870
Or, again, minus k
squared psi of x.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.890
Let's solve this.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.070
So how do we do it?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.130
Well it's, again, a
very simple equation,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.900
but this time it's
conveniences--

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.150
we don't have a
circle or periodicity

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.890
to use sines and cosines.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:08.050
So I'll take psi of x
to be c1 cosine of kx

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.420
plus c2 sine of kx.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.310
But the wave function
must vanish at 0.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.640
And at 0, the cosine
is 1, so you get c1.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.830
And the sine is 0, so this
must be 0, so c1 is gone.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.250
There's no c1 contribution
to the solution.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:48.420
So psi of x is c2 sine of kx.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.730
But we're not done.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.130
We need this function to
vanish at the other side.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:08.380
So psi of x equals a must
be 0, and that c2 sine of ka

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.366
must be 0.

00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:16.980
And therefore we realize
that ka must be equal

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:27.970
to a multiple of pi because sine
vanishes for 0, pi, 2 pi, 3 pi,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.445
minus pi, minus 2 pi, minus 3
pi, all the multiples of pi.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:44.820
And therefore we will
write kn equals 2 pi n--

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.120
not 2 pi n.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.750
Pi n over a.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:04.550
OK, well, let me ask you,
what should we take for n?

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.900
All integers?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.140
Should we skip some?

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.980
We took all integers
for the circle,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.970
but should we take
all integers here?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.400
So what happens
here, n equals 0.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.980
What's the problem
with n equals 0?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.640
n equals 0, k equals 0,
the wave function vanishes.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.260
Well, wave function
vanishing is really bad

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.960
because there is
no particle then.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.890
There is nowhere
in the probability

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.150
to find the particle.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.302
So n equals 0 is not
allowed, for sure.

00:07:39.302 --> 00:07:44.290
n equals 0, no.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.185
So why did we allow it, n
equals 0, in the circle?

00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:53.590
In the circle for n equals 0,
exponential doesn't vanish.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.605
It's a constant
and that constant

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:58.240
is a fine wave function.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.360
0 is not fine, but
the constant is good.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.150
But n equals 0 is not.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:09.310
So how about positive
ends or negative ends.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.690
And here comes the problem,
see we're getting to it.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:21.820
For n equals minus
2 or for n equals 2.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.050
So in one case, k is a number.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.430
And in the other case, k is
the opposite sign number.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:37.350
And sine of a number, or minus
a number, that number goes out.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:47.350
So if you have a sine of minus
kx, that's minus sine of kx.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.560
And two wave functions
that differ by a sign

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.040
are the same wave
function, physically.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.240
There's nothing different.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.030
They could differ by
an i and other things.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.740
So when you pick
negative n minus 1,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.090
or pick n equals plus 1, you
get the same wave function,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.790
but just different by a sign.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.360
So it's not new.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.620
So in this case,
it's very interesting

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.060
that we must restrict ourselves.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.930
We can correct all this
and just say n equals 1, 2,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.238
3, all the way to infinity.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.880
The wave function,
then, is psi n

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:44.140
of x, is proportional to
sine of n pi x over a.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.250
And you look at it and you
say, yes, that looks nice.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.170
For x equals 0, it vanishes.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.800
For x equals a, it vanishes.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.380
n and minus n would
give me the same wave

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.120
function up to a sine.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.240
So this is good.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.740
I just have to normalize it.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.268
And normalizing it would be
done by putting an n here.

00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:15.500
And then the integral psi n
squared dx from 0 to a only

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:24.130
would be n squared integral
from 0 to a dx of sine squared n

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.590
pi x over a.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:38.160
Now, you can do this
integral by calculation.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.950
And our sine squared
is written in terms

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:47.730
of a double angle cosine
of double angle plus a 1/2.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.790
The intuition with
these things are

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:55.710
that if you're integrating
over the right interval that

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:04.710
contains an integer number of
cycles of the sine squared,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.120
then the sine squared
has average 1/2.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.240
Because sine squared plus
cosine squared is equal to 1.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.040
So you don't have to do
the interval in general.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.920
This is n squared times
1/2 times the length

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.790
of the interval, which is a.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.885
And therefore n squared,
this is equal to 1,

00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:32.820
and therefore n is equal
to square root of 2/a

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.320
and we can write
now our solutions.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:48.770
Our solutions are m psi n
of x equals the square root

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:57.617
of 2/a sine n pi x over a.

00:11:57.617 --> 00:12:03.030
And n equals 1,
2, up to infinity.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:15.770
And En is equal to h
bar squared, k squared,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:22.238
so pi squared, n
squared, a squared, to m.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:34.080
That's it for the solutions of--

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.520
are there degeneracies?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.140
No.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.630
Every energy state is
different because there's

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.630
any single 1, 2, 3,
infinity, each one

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.930
has more energy than the next.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.240
No, I'm sorry, the energy
increases as you increase n.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.880
The energy levels actually
become more and more

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.780
spaced out.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.230
And the last thing I
want to do with this box

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.420
is to look at the states and
see how they look and gather

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.540
some important
properties that are

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.130
going to be very relevant soon.

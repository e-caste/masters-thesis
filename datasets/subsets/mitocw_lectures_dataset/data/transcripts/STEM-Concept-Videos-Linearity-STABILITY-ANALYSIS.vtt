00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.990
When you put a cold drink on the kitchen counter
the counter surface temperature will decrease.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.990
But, if the cold drink is removed, the counter
will eventually return to room temperature.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.039
If instead we place a cup of tea on the counter,
the counter temperature rises; but if we remove

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.039
the cup of tea, the counter top eventually
returns to room temperature. We say that the

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.019
counter at room temperature is a stable equilibrium.
In this video, we discuss the world from the

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.440
perspective of equilibrium and stability,
and in particular linear stability.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.030
This video is part of the Linearity video
series. Many complex systems are modeled or

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.540
approximated as linear because of the mathematical
advantages.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.570
All the world is an initial value problem,
and the matter merely state variables. However,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.260
and less poetically, there are alternative
interpretations of physical, and indeed social,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.049
systems that can prove very enlightening.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.260
The purpose of this video is to introduce
you to the framework of equilibrium and stability

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.360
analysis. We hope this motivates you to study
the topic in greater depth.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.310
To appreciate the material you should be familiar
with elementary mechanics, ordinary differential

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.310
equations, and eigenproblems.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.800
Let's look at the iced drink and hot teacup
example from the perspective of equilibrium

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.509
and stability.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.789
In this example, the governing partial differential
equation is the heat equation shown here.

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.320
At equilibrium, the solution of the governing
equations is time-independent, that is, the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070
partial time derivative is zero.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.310
This tells us that the del square temperature
term must also be zero, which is only possible,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.690
given the boundary conditions, if the entire
counter is at room temperature.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.149
Stability refers to the behavior of the system
when perturbed from a particular equilibrium

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.900
near the uniform counter temperature; a stable
system returns to the equilibrium state; an

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.390
unstable system departs from the equilibrium
state.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.340
We say that this equilibrium is stable because
if we perturb the temperature by increasing

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.430
or decreasing the temperature slightly, it
will return to room temperature, the equilibrium

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.980
state, after enough time.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.440
Here we intuitively understand that the equilibrium
is stable from our own experiences. But for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.480
other situations, we need mathematical methods
for determining whether or not equilibria

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.950
are stable.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.380
One way to determine if the equilibrium of
this partial differential equation is stable

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.020
is to apply an energy argument.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.240
Manipulation of this heat equation permits
us to derive a relationship that describes

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.810
how the "mean square departure" of the counter
temperature from room temperature evolves

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.290
over time, as shown here.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.599
Note u(x) is the deviation of the temperature
in the counter from room temperature, Ω is

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.599
the counter region, and Γ is the counter
surface; d1 and d2 are positive constants—determined

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.690
by the thermal properties of the counter.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.760
Because the right--hand side of this equation
is negative, it drives the temperature fluctuations—the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.180
integral of u(x) squared over the counter
region—to zero.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.180
This energy argument is the mathematical prediction
of the behavior we observe physically.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.739
Linear stability theory refers to the case
in which we limit our attention to initially

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.410
small perturbations. This allows us to model
the evolution with linear equation! Linearizing

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.819
the governing equations has many mathematical
advantages.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.700
Let's consider the following framework for
linear stability analysis.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.870
choose a physical system of interest;
develop a (typically nonlinear) mathematical

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.819
model;
identify equilibria;

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.540
linearize the governing equations about these
equilibria;

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.540
convert the initial value problem to an eigenproblem;
inspect the eigenvalues and associated eigenmodes

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.860
(or eigenvectors)

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.080
Let's see how to use this framework as we
proceed through the example of the real, physical

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.479
pendulum seen here.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.558
You see a large bob, the rod, and a flexural
hinge, which is designed to reduce friction

00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:37.939
losses.

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.990
Let's develop the mathematical model.
We show here the simple pendulum consisting

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.990
of a bob connected to a massless rod; we denote
the (angular) position of the bob by theta(t),

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.259
and the angular velocity of the bob by ω(t);
g is the acceleration due to gravity; and

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.180
L is the effective rod length for our simple
pendulum.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.900
The effective length L is chosen such that
the simple pendulum replicates the dynamics

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.279
of the real, physical pendulum; L is calculated
from the center of mass, the moment of inertia,

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.789
and the mass of the compound pendulum.

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.240
The dynamics may be expressed as a coupled
system of ordinary differential equations

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.219
that describe how the angular displacement
and angular velocity evolve over time.

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.080
These equations are nonlinear due to the presence
of sin(θ) and the drag function fdrag(ω).

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.409
The drag function is quite complicated.

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.330
For large ω—it is equal to c|omega|omega,
where c is a negative constant.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.270
But for very small angular velocities, near
points on the trajectory where the pendulum

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.669
isn't moving, or at least not moving fast,
drag is given by to b omega, where b is a

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.779
negative constant.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:57.150
Next, let's explore the validity of this model.
Here you see a comparison between a numerical

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.779
simulation, and an experiment, courtesy of
Drs. Yano and Penn, respectively.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:08.550
The numerical simulation is created by calibrating
the drag function to the experimental data.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.899
The agreement is quite good for both small
and large initial displacement angles.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:19.689
However, because we are fitting the dissipation
to the data, this comparison does not truly

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.689
validate the mathematical model.

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.419
To validate the mathematical model, we must
focus on a system property that is largely

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.499
independent of the here, small, dissipation,
such as the natural frequency, or period,

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.110
of the pendulum motion.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.020
And a comparison of the natural frequency
of the physical pendulum to that predicted

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.129
by the numerical model shows that the natural
frequencies agree quite well, for any initial

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:49.050
displacement angle, even large.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.058
We now look for equilibrium states, solutions
that are independent of time. To find these

00:06:55.058 --> 00:07:00.779
equilibria we set the left--hand side of the
equations to zero and solve for θ and ω.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.689
We can readily conclude that there are two
equilibria:

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.830
(θ, ω) = (0, 0), which we denote the "bottom"equilibrium;
and

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.110
(θ, ω) = (π, 0), which we denote the "top"equilibrium.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.960
The mathematical model actually has infinitely
many equilibria corresponding to theta values

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.099
that are integral multiples of pi.

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:24.119
But for our stability analysis, two will suffice.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:29.469
Are these equilibrium solutions stable or
unstable for the physical pendulum? Pause

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:35.439
the video here and discuss.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:40.679
They are stable if a small nudge will result
in commensurately small bob motion; They are

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:46.580
unstable, if a small nudge will result in
incommensurately large bob motion. So we can

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.619
predict that the bottom equilibrium is stable;
the top equilibrium, unstable. If our mathematical

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:57.159
model is good, it should predict the same
behavior as the physical system.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:08:01.869
But how do we mathematically analyze stability
of our model? Let's work through the linear

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:08.869
stability analysis framework for the bottom
equilibrium, θ = 0 and ω = 0. First, we

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.449
linearize the equations about the equilibrium.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:18.899
The linearized equations are only valid near
the equilibrium, theta = 0 and omega =0, i.e.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:25.020
for small displacements, theta prime, with
small angular velocities, omega prime.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.529
The first equation of our system is already
linear.

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:34.750
So we only need to worry about linearizing
the sin(0+θ') term and the dissipation term

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.549
of the second equation for small theta prime
and omega prime.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:46.550
What is the linear approximation of sin(theta')
about theta=0. Hint: use a Taylor series.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.080
Pause the video and write down your answer.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.060
If we assume that theta prime is small, we
can approximate sin(θ') by theta' — the

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:05.630
deviation of θ from 0— by ignoring the
higher order terms in the Taylor series expansion

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.020
of sin theta' about 0.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.450
Because we are linearizing near omega prime
sufficiently close to zero, the dissipation

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:20.330
term is asymptotic to b omega prime, as mentioned
previously. We then substitute these expressions

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.490
into our dynamical equations to obtain the,
linear equations indicated.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.930
We must supply initial conditions, and the
initial angle and angular velocity must be

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.840
small in order for this linearized system
of equations to be applicable. We now write

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.080
the linear equations in matrix form, in order
to prepare for the next step — formulation

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.270
as an eigenproblem.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:49.520
To do this, we assume temporal behavior of
the form eλt. This yields an eigenvalue problem

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.840
for λ.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.630
Note that our matrix is 2×2 and hence there
will be two eigenvalues and two associated

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.690
eigenvectors, or eigenmodes.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.900
Once we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
we may reconstruct the solution to the linearized

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:10.690
equations, as shown here; the constants c1
and c2 are determined by the initial conditions.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:17.050
However, to determine stability, a simple
inspection of the eigenvalues suffices:

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.280
What happens to e to the lambda t when each
of the eigenvalues has negative real part?

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.430
Pause the video.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:36.430
We observe that eλt decays in this case,
and the system is stable.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:43.250
What happens if any of the eigenvalues has
positive real part? Pause the video.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:50.250
If an eigenvalue has positive real part — in
which case eλt corresponds to exponential

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.200
growth away from the equilibrium

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.510
— the system is unstable; note that even
one eigenvalue with a positive real part is

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:05.840
sufficient to deem the system unstable, since
sooner or later, no matter how small initially,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.140
the growing exponential term will dominate.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.630
Lastly, if the real part of the eigenvalue
with largest real part is zero — in which

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:19.900
case eλt is of constant magnitude — the
system is marginally stable and requires further

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.180
analysis. We now proceed for our particular
system.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.240
For this problem it is easy to find the eigenvalues
analytically.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.810
We observe that both λ1 and λ2 have a small
negative real part - due to our negative damping

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.840
coefficient, b.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.490
Thus, the system is stable as we predicted
based on the physical pendulum.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:46.800
For our experimental system, b L over g is
much less than 1.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.720
And thus the damping does indeed have little
effect on the period of motion. If we recall

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.280
the connection between the complex exponential
and sine and cosine, we may conclude that

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.150
the linearized system response is a very slowly
decaying oscillation. This linear approximation

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.790
to our governing equations can predict not
just the stability of the system, but also

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:15.500
because the system is stable, the evolution
of the system—assuming of course small initial

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:15.950
conditions

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:22.040
Indeed, comparing our original non-linear
numerical solution to the numerical solution

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.600
obtained from the linear model, we find that
the agreement between the two is very good

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.470
for the low-amplitude case.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.860
As advertised, we obtain a solution to the
linear model with which we can predict the

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:39.680
motion resulting from small perturbations
away from equilibrium. But as you see here,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.550
the accuracy of the linear theory is indeed
limited to small perturbations

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.380
— for even moderately larger angles, the
linear model no longer adequately represents

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.870
the behavior of the pendulum.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.820
But this is to be expected since the linear
approximation of these governing equations

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:01.750
is only valid when theta prime and omega prime
are very close to zero.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:07.310
To Review
We have thus linearized the governing equations

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:12.370
for the pendulum near the equilibrium theta
= 0, omega = 0.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.600
By solving an eigenvalue problem, we showed
that the equilibrium was stable at this point.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.090
The linear equations even predict the behavior
of the pendulum near this stable equilibrium.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.560
This video has focused primarily on the modal
approach to stability analysis, which is the

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.940
simplest and arguably the most relevant approach
in many applications. However, there are other

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:40.940
important approaches too, such as the "energy"approach,
briefly mentioned at the outset of the video.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:48.290
We shall leave to you to analyze the case
of the "top"equilibrium, which we predicted

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.480
to be unstable.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.840
You'll find that there's an unstable mode
AND a stable mode. The unstable mode will

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.070
ultimately dominate, but the stable mode is
still surprising. Our intuition suggests than

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:07.800
any perturbation should grow. The stable mode
requires a precise specification of both initial

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:14.320
angular displacement AND initial angular velocity.
This explains the apparent contradiction between

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.070
the mathematics and our expectations.

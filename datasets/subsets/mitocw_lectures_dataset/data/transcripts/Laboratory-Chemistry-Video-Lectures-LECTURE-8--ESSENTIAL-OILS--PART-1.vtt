00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.970
SARAH HEWETT: All right.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.050
Good afternoon.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.660
Today, we are going
to start talking

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.360
about a new lab, the
Essential Oil lab.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.620
And if we look ahead a
little bit in the semester,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.250
so we're still working on
finishing up the Charles River

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.380
lab.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.840
We have today, then we have day
four on Wednesday and Thursday.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.460
And then next Monday
and Tuesday will

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.740
be day five of the
Charles River lab,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.302
and that'll be your quiz day.

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:40.010
And then after that,
we're going to start

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.010
a whole new set of labs.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.840
And the last three
labs of the semester--

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.152
so there are five total labs--

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:46.610
we're going to rotate so not
everybody is going to be doing

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.910
the same lab at the same time.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.030
So each bay in each
group with your TA,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.530
you'll be doing a different lab.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.000
So everybody will get a
chance to do all three,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.930
but you'll just do them
in a different order.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.520
So after the Charles River
lab, the A prime 2 group,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.660
the closest to the
middle of the lab,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510
you'll be doing the
essential oil lab.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.970
The center group will be
doing the catalase lab,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.250
and then the group closest
to the doors, A prime 4,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.818
will be doing the ester lab.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.610
And your TAs will help
make sure that which

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.277
lab you're supposed to do so you
know which pre-lab to write up.

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:16.112
And if you any questions,
it corresponds to groups

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:18.320
A, B, and C in the printed
version of the lab manual,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.850
and I think the
version on Steller

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.800
has been corrected with
the A prime notation

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.410
for telling you which lab you're
going to be doing when so you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.900
can keep track of
what you need to write

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.540
and what pre-labs
you need to do.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.290
And then if we take a
moment and look back

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.373
a little bit at what we
did for the Charles River,

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:34.980
I went on to the EPA
website, and they

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.193
have a buoy outside the
Museum of Science just down

00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:38.610
the river a little
ways where they

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.310
keep track of a whole bunch of
different metrics in the water.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.407
And you can go check out
what the buoy has recorded.

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:46.740
And so if you're interested,
you can go to this website.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.920
And they have, also, the
Massachusetts standards

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.170
that you can compare these
numbers to for some of them

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.650
anyway.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.710
And so the most recent
reading that they had

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.120
was from Monday, September
23, which was last week.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.412
And you can see that the pH
was around eight and a half

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.305
which is similar to
what you guys measured.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:04.680
The dissolved oxygen that they
had was around 10 and 1/2,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.700
which is a little bit higher
than what you guys had,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.220
but again, it
changes we know based

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.050
on the temperature and the day.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.290
And then this pink line that I
added down here at the bottom

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.590
is the phycocyanin which is
indicative of the cyanobacteria

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.223
that you heard about
in lecture before.

00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:22.890
And so you can see
it was it peaked here

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.348
in July and the
beginning of August

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:26.880
when we had the
cyanobacteria bloom.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.503
So something that
you can check out

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:30.420
if you want to when
you're writing up your lab

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.878
report if you want some more
information about what metrics

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:36.120
they look at and keep track
of in the Charles River.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.250
And now, talking about our
next lab, essential oils.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.970
So the word essential has
a few different definitions

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.015
depending on how
you're using it.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:46.140
And some people will say
it's essential, like, it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.610
the most important thing.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.260
The definition of
essential that we

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.450
mean when we are talking
about an essential oil

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.340
is that it is a
fundamental or central

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.990
to the nature of
something or someone,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.860
like the essence of a thing.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.000
And so the essential oils
come from plants, typically.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.950
And so we are talking
about the essence

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.770
of the plant or something
that comes from that plant

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.480
specifically.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.210
A little bit of history
of essential oils.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.980
Their recorded use is far back
in history as ancient Egypt.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.020
The Egyptians were big into
perfumes and cosmetics and all

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.520
of that.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.510
And they have records
of pressing plants

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.760
to get the oils out to
use in different perfumes

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.590
for the different scents.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.630
And also, in the days of the
plague in the medieval era,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.035
the doctors would wear these
masks full of different plants.

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.660
And they thought that breathing
through the plants and the oils

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.910
would help protect
them from disease.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.580
And if you look around
now at essential oils,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.325
you can find them
almost anywhere.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.700
But you may come
across something

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.240
called thieves' oil, which
is a blend of the oils

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.620
from those different plants.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.260
And the story behind that, which
may or may not be a legend,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.838
is that there during
the plague, everybody

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:56.880
would throw all their
corpses out into the street

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.070
and then there
would be people who

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.800
would go and loot the corpses
to steal what they could.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.300
And there was a
group of thieves who

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.500
was running around
stealing stuff off

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.780
of all these dead bodies
but they never got sick.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.380
And rumor has it that
they concocted this oil,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.260
and they would wear that
and put that on themselves

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.470
and it prevented the plague.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.959
And so that's what the
story of the thieves' oil

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.490
may or may not be true.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.992
So today, if you
look online and you

00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:23.450
do a search for
essential oils, you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.300
can find a million different
places to buy them.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.070
You can find all
sorts of information,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.440
some true some not, about
what essential oils do.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.180
So you may see
something like this

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.982
that has different
types of essential oils,

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.440
different plants that they come
from, and all of the things

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.470
that they are rumored to treat.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.400
You can buy the essential oil of
almost any plant that you like,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.680
depending on where you look.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.123
And not all of this
is just hearsay.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.540
There are people
that are actually

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.998
doing different
studies, especially

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:55.350
in the veterinary
medicine world, of using

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.840
different essential
oils to treat

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.480
different fungal infections
or bacterial infections.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.000
A lot of these have
antibiotic properties,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and they can disrupt
some biofilms

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.280
depending on the
different properties which

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.080
isn't super surprising
since a lot of these

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.570
are just hydrocarbons that
you could also synthesize

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.070
and are similar in
structure to some

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.900
of the drugs and
synthetic products

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.442
that we make to do
these same things.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.258
So essential oils,
where do they come from?

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.550
So you ... how do you go from
something that looks like

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.970
a plant from the garden
to a little vial of oil?

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.450
And the ratio of
how much plant you

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.190
need to get a few milliliters
of oil is very, very large.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.010
So it's not the most
efficient process.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.670
But the way that it is most
commonly done commercially now

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.540
is through steam distillation.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.390
So you can grind up
your plant material,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.110
chop it up a little bit to
increase the surface area.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.820
You heat up water, put
steam through the material.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.070
It helps volatilize the oils.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.050
And then the steam and
the oils co-distill.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.910
You can condense it back down.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.800
And then you'll get a
mixture of this water

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.020
with all of the water
soluble parts of the plant

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.775
and then your essential oils,
and you can separate them out.

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:08.650
And the reason that you
can separate them out

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.610
is due to their structure.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.998
So most essential oils are
made up of isoprene units.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.790
And so that's the
structure of an isoprene.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.490
It has five carbons
and eight hydrogens.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.360
And then when you
stick them together,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.110
you get a class of
molecules called terpenes.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.610
And so a terpene is more
than one isoprene unit.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.350
So the way that you
name these things

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.542
is that if you have
two isoprene units,

00:06:31.542 --> 00:06:33.250
that's the smallest
terpene you can have,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.930
so it's called the monoterpene.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.270
Then sesquiterpene,
diterpene is four

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.490
because it has two
of the monoterpenes.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.370
Triterpene and tetraterpene
is when you have eight.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.460
So if we look at
some of the molecules

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.320
that you may know
from everyday life,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.570
does anyone know what this is?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.330
So that's vitamin A. If you
look at the structure of it,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.140
we can try and find all
of the isoprene units, so

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.360
these five carbon units.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.860
So if you start at the
top there is one there.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.110
And we have another one,
two, three, four, five there.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.960
And then you can keep
going down the chain.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.690
So how many isoprene
units do we have here?

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.460
We have one, two, three, four.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.850
So this would be a diterpene.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.850
And then does anyone know
what this molecule is?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.310
So that's menthol use
in minty flavorings.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:53.270
And this has two isoprene units
and then this hydroxy group.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.940
So you can have these
terpene structures that

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.770
have the isoprene units
and then they also

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.423
can have different
functional groups attached.

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:02.090
A lot of times it'll
be a hydroxyl group

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.500
or a carbonyl group.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.310
And then this molecule, which
you also may have heard of,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.400
is camphor.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.170
So that's used in lotions a lot
of times to treat irritation.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.100
And this one's a
little bit tricky,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.930
but you can find
the isoprene unit.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.380
So there's one there
and then one there.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.390
Oh, other way.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:34.450
So those are some
common terpenes

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.179
that are found in essential
oils that you may or may not

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.219
have seen in other contexts.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.330
The structure that
we care about,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.742
in this particular
lab-- yes, Jesse.

00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:47.200
STUDENT: I'm a
little bit confused.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.960
So on the slide said five
carbon and eight hydrogens?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.710
SARAH HEWETT: Yes.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.040
STUDENT: So for menthol, for
instance, there's five carbons

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.665
and more than eight hydrogens.

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:57.970
Right?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.980
SARAH HEWETT: Yes, in
this case they would.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.400
STUDENT: So does it require
a double bond in order for it

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.770
to be called-- classified
as an isoprene?

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.097
SARAH HEWETT: No.

00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:11.680
I was also kind of
curious about that,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.800
and I personally didn't find
a good answer on the internet.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.200
But when I was looking through
the literature and stuff,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.810
menthol was referred
to as a terpene.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.160
So I don't know,
if maybe once they

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.650
get combined together
with the double bonds

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.788
that it's not as strict, or once
you start adding extra groups.

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:30.330
I'm not sure.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.432
That's a good question, and
I can get back to you on that

00:09:33.432 --> 00:09:35.640
and how they actually name
and classify these things.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.860
Because, yeah, in
some of the cases,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.600
the double bonds go
away, and it doesn't

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.800
have quite the right ratio.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.430
So in our lab, the
essential oil component

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.640
that we are going to be
looking at is carvone.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.300
And there are two
types of carvone.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.890
So carvone is a major
component of spearmint oil

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.293
and is also a major
component of carraway oil.

00:10:02.293 --> 00:10:03.960
And those are two
very different things,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.380
and if you've smelled
either of them, then

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.380
that they smell different,
they taste different.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.770
And the reason for that is
because we have a chiral center

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.590
down at the bottom.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.550
So there are two
different possible isomers

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.590
of this molecule and they
have different properties,

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.130
some properties are different.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.670
So we'll need to take a moment
and look at chiral centers.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.910
So a chiral center occurs when
four different substituents are

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.645
attached to one carbon center.

00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:32.270
And you have probably
talked about this

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.730
in your organic chemistry class
or in your other chemistry

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.570
courses.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.670
So as a quick
refresher to determine,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.340
they are labeled the R
versus S. And to determine

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.125
whether it's an R or an S
stereocenter, you go through

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.500
and you look at each group
that's attached to the carbon,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.292
and then you assign
priority to each group.

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:52.400
And this is typically
done most straightforward

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.995
is through atomic mass.

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:55.370
So you look at
the atoms that are

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.613
attached to the carbon center.

00:10:57.613 --> 00:11:00.030
And then the highest atomic
mass has the highest priority.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.680
The lowest has the
lowest priority.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.055
And if you have
a double bond, it

00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:06.000
counts as two bonds
the atom counts twice.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.050
So if you have longer
chains and they look similar

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.882
at the first point, then you
keep going down the chain

00:11:11.882 --> 00:11:13.340
until the first
point of difference

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.060
and then you can
help assign priority.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.035
So if we look at our
carvone molecule,

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:21.910
usually, if your
stereocenter has a hydrogen,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.470
that's pretty much always going
to be your lowest priority

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.970
group.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.960
So I've drawn this
particular isomer

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.930
with the hydrogen
pointing away from us

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.010
so that we can more easily
determine R versus S. So

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.400
can anyone help assign the
priority of these three groups?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.360
Does anyone know what the
highest priority would be?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.860
Alec.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860
STUDENT: It would be the
substituent towards the end.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.660
SARAH HEWETT: Yep.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.730
Why?

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.935
STUDENT: Because it's attached
to a carbon that is secondary.

00:11:52.935 --> 00:11:55.040
It's attached to
two more carbons.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.790
SARAH HEWETT: Yes.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.030
STUDENT: And a double bond.

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.310
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, no,
you're saying it right.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.200
So this one's attached
to two carbons and one

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.200
of them being a double bonds
so that counts kind of twice.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.810
And these carbons are just
attached to two hydrogens each,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.120
so this has an overall
higher atomic mass,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.530
so this is going to be
our highest priority.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.030
Then what?

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.042
Pointing out this way.

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:24.500
So then you go to this carbon,
and this one's double bonded

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.010
to a carbon.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.920
But this one's double
bonded to an oxygen

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.720
so that has higher
priority and that

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.850
just leaves our final group.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.650
So does this go
counterclockwise or clockwise?

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.370
Counterclockwise?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.330
So R or S?

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.190
S.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.750
So the way that
chiral molecules work

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.090
is if you take the
mirror image, then you

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.520
get the opposite configuration.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.770
So if this is our S, if we
flip these two substituents

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.470
on our chiral center,
then we get the R.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.890
Or if you prefer to look at
it as the actual mirror image,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.692
if you kind of ignore this, then
this molecule and this molecule

00:12:58.692 --> 00:13:00.150
are the mirror
image of each other.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.330
So even though this group
is pointing forward in both,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.730
the oxygen and the double
bond have flip sides,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.900
so these two are mirror images.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.560
So this is also R.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.150
And a big part of
organic chemistry

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.230
and figuring these
things out is being

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.900
able to manipulate the molecules
spatially in your head.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.320
A lot of times it's
easier with models.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.310
But does that makes
sense how we get those?

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.800
Excellent.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.050
So we can talk about
different cultural centers,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.940
and we can also talk
about chiral molecules

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.120
as a quick review.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.010
So if you have chiral
centers in your molecule,

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.872
then you'll have, potentially,
a chiral molecule.

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:41.330
So a molecule's
chiral if it is not

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.840
superimposable on
its mirror image.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.510
And then within that,
we have two other ways

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.850
to name these stereoisomers.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.082
One is in enantiomer which
is a pair of molecules

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:52.540
that are mirror
images that are not

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.050
superimposable on each other.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:14:00.150
So that would be like
this pair of molecules.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.400
So these are enantiomers.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.480
They are mirror images.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.160
And if you try to flip
this around and stick it

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.380
on this one, you'll see
that if you flip this over

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.880
so that the chlorine
and the hydroxyl group

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.800
are on the same side,
they'll be pointing back

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.080
and these are not
superimposable.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.920
Same thing with these two.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.900
These are enantiomers.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.760
They are mirror images,
and they are not

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.200
superimposable on each other.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.980
But you can see that all four
of these molecules are related

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.605
and that they are
isomers and that they

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:29.127
have the same atoms in a
very similar configuration.

00:14:29.127 --> 00:14:31.210
The only thing that differs
is the stereochemistry

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.260
at each of these chiral centers.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.910
And so these molecules, say,
are related to each other

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.830
and that they are
not mirror images,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.390
but they are also not
superimposable on each other.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:46.930
And so these are called
diastole diastereomers.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.400
These two have the
same relationship.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.300
These are diastereomers.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.940
So are these two and these two.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.450
So that's the
terminology that we

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.867
are going to be
using when we talk

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.580
about different
molecules that have

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.080
different numbers
of chiral centers.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.300
So if you have more
than one chiral center,

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.658
you can get all of these
different relationships.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.440
This becomes important
in biological systems.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.440
So if you have a protein, your
amino acids in your protein

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.490
are chiral.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.950
So you end up with
protein the protein

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.215
structure is determined by the
chirality of these amino acids.

00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:29.840
So you can end up
with a chiral surface

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.290
that has a bunch of chiral and
individual molecules in it.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.368
And then if you have a
substrate for your enzyme

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:38.660
that is also chiral and you
have different enantiomers,

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.147
one will fit and one will not.

00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:43.730
And you can also look at it if
you have a cultural center that

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.897
has three different things
to it and a receptor that

00:15:45.897 --> 00:15:47.600
has three different
locations, then

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:53.140
there is only one orientation
that will match up properly.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.212
So if you start rearranging
those substituents

00:15:55.212 --> 00:15:56.670
around that carbon
center, then you

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.940
won't be able to line up
with your target properly.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.680
And this comes into play in
your eyes and in your smell

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.630
and in your taste.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.975
So these carvone isomers,
these enantiomers,

00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:15.350
one of them taste like mint
and the other one tastes like

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.850
carraway .

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.400
And most people can
tell the difference.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.680
There is about 10% of the
population that cannot tell

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.388
the difference between
these two isomers.

00:16:22.388 --> 00:16:24.963
So when you get your oil
in lab, if you smell yours

00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:27.130
and then if you smell your
neighbor's, hopefully you

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.000
should be able to
smell a difference.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.730
But it'll be interesting to see
if anybody can or cannot tell

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.440
the difference between
these two chemicals.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.700
One of the ways that this chiral
recognition and this chirality

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.338
in biology has played out is in
the case of thalidomide, which

00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:44.880
again, is something
that you may have

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.588
heard of in your other
chemistry courses.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.630
So this is the structure
of thalidomide.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.450
And there is a chiral center.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.540
Where's the chiral
center in thalidomide?

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.080
Right there.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.960
You be a little more specific.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.194
To the right of the N, yes.

00:17:03.194 --> 00:17:04.569
So here's a chiral
center, so you

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.390
can have an R and S
versions of thalidomide.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:14.480
And as it turns out, let's see,
I don't want to say this wrong.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.897
The r version is used to
treat nausea and is used

00:17:18.897 --> 00:17:19.730
uses a sleeping aid.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.780
And the S version
causes birth defects.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.359
And so this drug was
given in the '70s

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.512
and the '80s to a lot of women
who had morning sickness.

00:17:29.512 --> 00:17:31.220
And they took it while
they were pregnant

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.420
and their children ended up
with a lot of birth defects

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.060
because they were given both
enantiomers of this drug.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.630
And even if they had been
given enantiomerically pure

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.355
thalidomide, your
body has enzymes

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.230
and you can do reactions
that will convert in

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.313
between the stereoisomers.

00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:48.890
So there is no safe
way to give thalidomide

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.790
to a pregnant woman.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.350
In a less traumatic
case, ibuprofen,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.907
this is the structure
of ibuprofen.

00:17:59.907 --> 00:18:00.990
Where's our chiral center?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:10.870
STUDENT: That one.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.070
SARAH HEWETT: That one?

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.120
Excellent.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.230
So you can have R and S
versions of ibuprofen as well,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.840
and only the S version of
this drug works in your body

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.950
as a pain reliever.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.980
And it inhibits certain
chemical reactions

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.045
in that pathway in your body.

00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:28.420
And biology majors, I'm sure
you know way more about this

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.735
than I do.

00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:31.360
So the S version
works in the R version

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.790
has no biological
activity, at least in terms

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.290
of the target of
this drug, which is

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.680
to treat pain and inflammation.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.390
But it's given as
a racemic mixture

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.835
because the second
enantiomer does not

00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:44.710
have any negative effects
that we know about.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.835
And your body can actually
convert between the two.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.760
So if you're given
all of the S form,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.385
which they have done
to people and that

00:18:50.385 --> 00:18:53.195
actually has more of
a benefit to them,

00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:54.820
but it'll convert
some of it into the R

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.028
form which is useless anyway.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.780
So if we go back to
our molecule carvone,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.910
we can look at the
two types of carvone.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.550
And these are the
two isomers, so they

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.860
have the same molecular
weight, same boiling point

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.550
but different physical
property in how they smell

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.265
and how they taste.

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.640
So carvone is what
we care about,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.270
but essential oils are
not pure substances.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.728
So if we give you
the spearmint oil

00:19:19.728 --> 00:19:21.740
and we give you
the carraway oil,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.148
then they'll have more in
it than just the carvone

00:19:26.148 --> 00:19:26.940
that we care about.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.560
So the major impurity
that you guys

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.560
are going to see in both
of these essential oils

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.370
is called limonene.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.953
And that is the
structure of limonene.

00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:35.180
It is also chiral.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.720
So it has a chiral center
down here at the bottom.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.540
And-- oh, my notes
didn't show up.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.840
Bummer.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.050
And so one of the
isomers of this,

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.910
I believe it's the R
smells like oranges

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.030
and the S smells like lemons.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.178
So it's found in high
quantities in citrus plants.

00:19:52.178 --> 00:19:52.970
It's a monoterpene.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.140
It has two of these
isoprene units.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.130
And in our case, it's
going to be an impurity.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.500
So we are going to
try and separate

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.583
the carvone in our essential
oil from the limonene

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.477
in our essential oil.

00:20:01.477 --> 00:20:03.560
So if we look at these two
compounds side by side,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.230
how are we going
to separate them?

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.326
Alec.

00:20:11.326 --> 00:20:13.320
STUDENT: Carvone has
an oxygen so we're

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.798
going to pull it in limonene?

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:17.590
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.260
So one way you could
think about separating

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.180
these is by they are very
similar in structure,

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.597
but the only major
difference here

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:25.303
is this oxygen, which makes the
carvone slightly more polar.

00:20:25.303 --> 00:20:26.970
So you could think
about using some sort

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.100
of chromatographic
technique, maybe,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.110
like we did before to separate
them based on polarity.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.520
So that's one way
we could do it.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.060
What else is
different about them?

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.860
STUDENT: Boiling point.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.193
SARAH HEWETT: The boiling point.

00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:43.280
And so using the polarity is
a little bit more complicated.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.748
But if we want to use
straightforward basic gen chem

00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:47.290
principles, then we
can separate them

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.780
by our boiling point
using distillation

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.180
which is a technique that
you all probably heard of.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.410
And I have the distillation
apparatus set up here.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.850
So this distillation
apparatus is a short path

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.575
simple distillation.

00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:05.700
So the way distillation
works is if you have either

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.158
a mixture of two liquids that
have different boiling points

00:21:08.158 --> 00:21:11.040
or if you have a liquid that
has some nonvolatile impurities

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.620
in it, you can put
your mixture in here,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.440
heat it up, and then
re condense the vapor

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.960
and then you can
collect, hopefully,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.110
your purified substance
at the end of it.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.590
So if we have this
mixture of two liquids,

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.780
then we need to talk
about different laws that

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.540
govern how two liquids
and how to vapors interact

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.540
with each other.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.610
So the first thing that we want
to talk about is Raoult's law.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.280
And what Raoult's law says
is that the partial pressure

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.010
of a substance is equal
to the mole fraction

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.380
of that substance, which
is the x, times the vapor

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.870
pressure of the pure substance.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.990
So if we have a
mixture of two things,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.323
and we want to figure out
what the vapor pressure of one

00:21:49.323 --> 00:21:53.035
of them is above
the mixture, and we

00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:54.910
look at the mole fraction
within the mixture.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.370
And the mole fraction is just
the moles of the component

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.760
that we care about over the
total moles in your mixture.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.340
So if you have two
things, you add

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.670
to the total number
of moles, divide that

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.308
by the number of moles of the
thing that you care about.

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:11.100
And then you can look
up the vapor pressure

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.715
of what the pure
substance would be,

00:22:12.715 --> 00:22:15.090
and then you can get the vapor
pressure of that substance

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.682
above a mixture.

00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:19.390
And then Dalton's law
of partial pressure

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.980
says that the total
pressure of a gas

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.410
is going to be equal to the
sum of the partial pressures.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.368
So if you can figure out
your partial pressures

00:22:27.368 --> 00:22:30.060
using Raoult's law, then if
you have a mixture of pentane

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.250
and hexane-- and this was
taken from your textbook

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.417
if you want to look this up.

00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:36.060
If you read this,
it's in figure 12.3.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.620
Chapter 12 is all
about distillation.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.310
So that's a good resource
for this lab in particular.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.060
But if you have pure pentane,
then your total pressure

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.900
is going to be just the
pressure of pentane.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.020
And this is your
pressure of pentane.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.990
And then you can see that if
you add up these two lines, then

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.630
you'll get the total equaling
your blue line, which

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.450
is your total pressure
at various different mole

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.030
fractions of each
of these substances.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.640
So the way that it
plays out for us,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.030
if we're going to be heating
up a mixture and at--

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.130
hello-- and a different
mole fractions, then we'll

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:18.770
have different amounts of
each vapor in our total vapor

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.290
pressure, then we need
to think about that when

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.630
we are doing our distillation.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.190
And so you can make a
temperature composition

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.220
diagram.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.797
And this is a little bit
confusing to look at it first,

00:23:29.797 --> 00:23:30.880
or at least it was for me.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.370
So we can go through how
this plays out in real life.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.460
So if you have a mixture
of hexane and pentane--

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.970
this is just a
theoretical situation.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.700
And the boiling points of hexane
are 68 degrees and pentane

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.170
boils at 36 degrees.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.020
And we wanted to get pure
pentane which is our lower

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.820
boiling point thing.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:55.950
So if we start out with a
mixture that's about 75% hexane

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.190
and we vaporize it, then the
boiling point of that liquid

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.070
will be closer to the
boiling point of hexane

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.820
because there's
more hexane in it.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.340
If we cool that vapor down so
it's at the same temperature,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.880
so heat it up to 65,
cool it to a vapor at 65,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.510
and then re-condense
it to a liquid phase,

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:18.060
now our mole fraction
of hexane is about half.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.000
So we've purified our vapor.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.120
If we take a starting
mixture that has about half

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.810
and half hexane and
pentane and we heat that up

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.318
to its boiling
point, which is now

00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:33.860
going to be lower because it
has a higher fraction of pentane

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.527
in it, if we cool it down
at the same temperature

00:24:36.527 --> 00:24:38.360
and then re-condense
it to the liquid phase,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:45.980
now our mixture has about
a little less than 0.4

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.840
of our more fraction of hexane.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.600
And then if we heat that
back up and vaporize it,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.220
cool it back down, now
we have even less hexane.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.110
Heat it up, cool
it down, now we are

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:03.280
getting very close to pure
pentane with no hexane in it.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.580
So we get very close to a mole
fraction of zero for a hexane,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.960
and we get closer to the actual
boiling point of pure pentane.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.660
So if you look at
this diagram, then how

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.370
many of those
heating and cooling

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.810
and re-vaporization
cycles did we

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.810
have to go through to
get down to a vapor that

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.070
is pure in pentane?

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.150
So in this case, it's
about five cycles of that.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.055
And depending on the difference
in boiling point of your two

00:25:32.055 --> 00:25:33.680
liquids that you're
trying to separate,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.567
it may take even more cycles
to get to your pure compound

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:38.400
that you care about.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.090
And if the boiling points
are greater in difference,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:47.640
then it'll take fewer cycles to
get to your pure liquid phase.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.300
So if we have these two liquids
that we were trying to separate

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.510
and we want to get down to
a pure fractions of limonene

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.510
in carvone and we want
to separate them and make

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.840
them pure, how are
we going to do that?

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.340
A lot of distillations.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:08.227
Or we can do what's called
a fractional distillation.

00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:09.310
So I told you this before.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.510
This one is a
simple distillation,

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.820
and you can see that there
is not a lot of room in here

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.090
for the vapor to vaporize
and then re-condense

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:22.300
before you collect it in your
collection vessels over here.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.310
If you provide
more surface area,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.103
then the vapor has more
chances to come into contact

00:26:28.103 --> 00:26:29.020
with the cooler glass.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.240
It'll re-condense
into the liquid phase.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.730
And then if you're heating
this, it'll drip down,

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.637
it'll be reheated by
the hot vapor coming up,

00:26:35.637 --> 00:26:37.720
and so then you can have
multiple of these heating

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.970
and cooling cycles
before you start

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.280
collecting your final product.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.400
And so this is a fractionating
column or a Vigreux column.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.680
And you can see,
hopefully maybe,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.870
that it is not just
straight glass, that it

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.760
has all of these
little divots in it

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.010
and it has a lot
of kind of spikes

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.560
going into the middle that
provide a lot of surface area

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.978
for this vapor to hit
to cool and to reheat.

00:27:02.978 --> 00:27:05.020
So this provides a much
more efficient separation

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.730
than just the simple
distillation when you can only

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.772
go through a couple of
heating and cooling cycles

00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:09.980
before you collect it.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.540
So this will help us to
get a more pure product.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:19.313
And it is very helpful for
when the two things that you're

00:27:19.313 --> 00:27:21.730
trying to separate have boiling
points that are relatively

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.860
close to each other,
being like less than 50

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.660
or 60 degrees apart.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.650
So there are some
things to consider

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.733
if you're going to use
distillation as a technique

00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:34.380
anyway.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.968
And so one of them is the
boiling point of liquids

00:27:36.968 --> 00:27:38.260
that you're trying to separate.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.110
So how hot does this
thing need to get?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.327
Is it a feasible temperature
for you to reach in the lab?

00:27:44.327 --> 00:27:46.410
One of them is how pure
your fractions need to be.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.645
So if you don't really
care about the purity

00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:52.270
of your fractions, then you can
do a quick simple distillation,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.430
collect your product,
call it a day.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.470
And then do your
compounds decompose

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.720
if you heat them too high?

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.780
And in our case, yes, they do.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.650
So if we heat our
compounds too high,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.307
so they have a pretty
high boiling point

00:28:09.307 --> 00:28:11.640
if you remember back or if
you look back in your slides.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.993
So we try to hit
them aggressively

00:28:13.993 --> 00:28:15.660
to that boiling point,
then our products

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.738
may decompose before
we can collect them.

00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:20.280
So we have to figure out a way
to make things boil at a lower

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.840
temperature.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.890
So if we think about our
definition of boiling,

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.470
it is the temperature at which
the vapor pressure of a liquid

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.758
equals the pressure
above the liquid.

00:28:30.758 --> 00:28:32.300
So there are two
ways that if we need

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.800
to lower our boiling points
that we don't have to heat it up

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.340
to over 200 degrees, then how
do we lower the boiling point?

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.627
We can either increase the
vapor pressure of the liquid.

00:28:40.627 --> 00:28:42.710
So usually, we increase
the pressure of the liquid

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.610
by just heating it.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.180
You heat the molecules up,
they become into the gas phase,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.850
and you increase the pressure
within the liquid itself.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.310
Or you can reduce the
pressure above the solution.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.310
So if we reduce the
pressure above the solution,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.852
then we don't have
to heat it as much

00:28:56.852 --> 00:28:59.578
in order for those
pressures to be equal.

00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:01.370
So that is what we're
going to do in class.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.080
We're going to
use both of these.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.220
We're going to have
to heat it, and we're

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.012
going to reduce the
vapor pressure in order

00:29:05.012 --> 00:29:08.590
to make the vapor pressure a
reasonable temperature for us

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.915
to get to in the lab.

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:11.790
And the way that we're
going to be doing this

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.360
is with a vacuum distillation.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.790
So this distillation setup
is identical to the one

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.100
that you will be
setting up in the lab.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.440
And this is kind of nice
because the glassware is all

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440
sealed together.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.180
So your column, your condenser,
and your distilling head

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.260
over here have all
been made as one piece

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.823
you have fewer joints where
you could lose your vacuum.

00:29:37.823 --> 00:29:39.240
So when you get
this, you're going

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.100
to get it as a kit
from the stockroom,

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.450
and it will have this one
big piece of glassware in it,

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.170
so be very careful when
you are opening and taking

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.137
things out of this
kit because this

00:29:49.137 --> 00:29:51.720
is a large piece of glass where
it should be wrapped in bubble

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.820
wrap in most cases, but
we don't want to break it

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:59.350
because it is expensive and a
specialty piece of equipment.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.800
So if we go through this and
talk about different pieces,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.925
they're all very important.

00:30:02.925 --> 00:30:05.230
So this is where
your mixture will go.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.830
And if you look at the picture
of an actual set up in lab,

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.810
you'll have your stirring plate.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.227
So whenever you
heat something you

00:30:10.227 --> 00:30:14.280
want to stir it so that it helps
the bubbles to form because you

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.580
don't want your solution
to get superheated

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.330
and then all start
boiling all at one time

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.997
because it'll shoot
up into your column.

00:30:20.997 --> 00:30:25.230
And then if you flood your
column with your mixture,

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.740
then there aren't any surfaces
for the vaporization cycles

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.120
to happen, and so you will get
very inefficient separation

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.610
of your two liquids.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.645
So you want to make sure
that you have stirring

00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:40.020
and you don't heat it too
quickly so that you don't flood

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.008
your column with the
bubbles and that you give it

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.550
a chance to just
have the vapor go up

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.587
your fractionating column.

00:30:47.587 --> 00:30:49.920
So you'll have your heating
mantle, your stirring plate,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.530
and then you'll have
your mixture in here.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.970
This is your
fractionating column.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.553
And then you'll have
your thermometer.

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.140
And our thermometers
are all set up

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.560
to have a ground glass
joint, so they'll just

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.850
sit right in the top here.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.100
And you want to make sure
that the thermometer bulb is

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.933
right in the path of where your
vapor is traveling so that you

00:31:04.933 --> 00:31:06.600
can monitor the
temperature of the vapor

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.120
that you're collecting so you
know what the temperature is.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.800
And you can use it
to help identify

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.740
which fraction is which.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.580
So if you know the
temperature of the vapor

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.080
that you're collecting,
then you can

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.455
compare that to
the boiling point

00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:19.420
you know what you're collecting.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.540
Then you'll have your
condenser, and this is going

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.965
to be filled with cold water.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.840
So we have cold water
supplies from the hood.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.675
You will attach the water in at
the bottom and out at the top.

00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:31.133
Your TAs will go over this,
too, but this is very important

00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:34.042
because you want this whole
thing to be full of water.

00:31:34.042 --> 00:31:35.500
So if you put the
water in the top,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.790
then gravity will
kind of do this thing,

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.060
you can see it's on an angle.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.060
So the gravity will come,
it'll just go straight

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.500
out the bottom, and
then this whole top part

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.550
will be full of air.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.460
That's not helpful.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.890
So we can use gravity
to help us here.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.150
If you put the
water in the bottom,

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.525
it'll fill up the
whole condenser

00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:48.592
and then go out the top.

00:31:48.592 --> 00:31:50.800
And this could be, possibly,
the most important thing

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.490
I will tell you today.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.710
This little metal piece is
very important to the success

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:58.687
of your lab.

00:31:58.687 --> 00:32:00.020
Does anyone know what this does?

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.650
So this piece goes when
you attach your tubing

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.870
from your waterlines,
you want to have

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.310
one of these little metal guys.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.920
And it'll wrap around your
tubing and your glassware,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.780
and then it'll clip
together to secure

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.835
your glassware to your tubing.

00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:23.210
And this is important because
once you turn the water on,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.520
the water is at a pretty
decently high pressure.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.670
And if you are not
paying attention,

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:32.210
the tubing does not stay
on these little adapters

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.080
very well.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.030
Your tubing will pop
off, and then you

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:39.800
have a faucet of water
coming through a rubber hose.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.330
I don't know if you've ever seen
those like wild inflatable tube

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.830
bend, yeah, like that's what's
going to happen in your hood.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.467
And so your lab partner
will be upset with you.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:52.050
You'll be upset put yourself and
everything will get very wet.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.990
And there are no
drains in the hoods,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.730
so it's a big mess to clean up.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.550
So before you turn
your water on,

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.950
make sure that all of
your tubing is clamped.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.367
It's my public service
announcement for the lab.

00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:05.450
And your TAs, I'm sure,
will also be checking this

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.400
very carefully.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.660
They know what happens.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.087
So then, we have our
condenser, and then we

00:33:14.087 --> 00:33:15.170
will have this piece here.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.640
And you can see that there's
another spout out here.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.950
And this connects
to your vacuum line.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.408
So you know those manifolds
that you used with the nitrogen

00:33:20.408 --> 00:33:21.550
lines in the ferrozine lab?

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.410
Yeah, so one end is connected
to the nitrogen lines

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.410
and the other end is
connected to a vacuum pump.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.430
So you're going to use the
vacuum side of those this time.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.672
And so there's a
pressure gauge on there

00:33:33.672 --> 00:33:35.880
that will tell you what the
pressure is once you turn

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.047
the vacuum on in the system.

00:33:37.047 --> 00:33:38.880
It's a digital one, so
you can just read it.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.710
It gives you the
output value in torr.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.780
And we're going to get this
down to close to one torr

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.887
or below for this
particular experiment.

00:33:48.887 --> 00:33:51.470
So you will make sure that your
vacuum line is connected here.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.610
You'll turn your vacuum on.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.110
And then if we're
going to make sure

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.160
this whole system
is under vacuum

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.410
and you want to be able to
collect different fractions

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.630
so your things will boil
at different temperatures,

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.700
so you can't be
swapping your collection

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.510
vessel in and out if your
whole system is under vacuum.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.990
So we use what's
called a cow adapter.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.560
So this is a cow thing because
it looks like some cow udders.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.080
And you can attach
four different flasks

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.130
to the bottom of it.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.820
And the ones that
you'll see in lab

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.070
will have a little spout here.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.120
And so you can see which
flask your spout is pointing

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.451
towards when you are using it.

00:34:21.451 --> 00:34:22.909
So if you want,
you can rotate this

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.219
so that you collect
your different fractions

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.370
in different files or
in different flasks.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.620
And you want to make sure
that when you do all of this

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.170
that all of your joints are
nice and tightly clamped.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.690
So you want to put Keck clips,
these little yellow guys,

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.038
on all of the joints that
you attach to each other.

00:34:38.038 --> 00:34:39.830
And then you're going
to use vacuum grease,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.639
and your TAs will show
you how to do that.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.679
You just need a
little bit of grease,

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.221
but you want to make sure that
the grease is there to provide

00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:46.730
a good seal and so
that you can undo

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.590
your glassware after
you've put it under vacuum.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.750
So that is the case.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.489
And then the last thing that you
need to know is the ice bath.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:01.350
So once you have
heated up your mixture,

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.350
you've re-condensed your vapor,
and you're collecting hopefully

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.180
another liquid
over here, we have

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.680
this under a reduced
pressure, which

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.763
means that the boiling
point has now been lowered.

00:35:09.763 --> 00:35:11.910
So you don't want
what you've already

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.970
collected as pure
product to re-vaporize

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.800
and go back into your system.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.720
And you don't want these
to kind of evaporate

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.220
and then re-condense
into each other

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.928
and contaminate the
fractions that you've

00:35:21.928 --> 00:35:23.160
worked so hard to collect.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.590
So you're going to have to
kind of engineer your ice bath

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.040
to only cool one flask
at a time, especially

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.090
the limonene fraction.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.865
That one tends to
be very volatile.

00:35:31.865 --> 00:35:33.240
So your TAs, again,
will tell you

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.530
about this when you
get to lab, but you

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.780
want to make sure that you
are cooling your fractions

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.570
but not cooling too many of them
so that you don't get spillage

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.140
into different vessels.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.630
And so that will
be how you collect

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.795
your limonene and your carvone.

00:35:47.795 --> 00:35:49.670
And hopefully, you should
be able to separate

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.350
both of those components from
your essential oil mixture

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.100
that you're given.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.870
So some of you guys will
start with the carraway oil,

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.787
some of you will start
with the spearmint oil,

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:59.827
and then you will both end
up with limonene and carvone.

00:35:59.827 --> 00:36:01.910
It will just depend on
which isomer of the carvone

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:02.630
that you have.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.470
So when we were doing this,
if we know the boiling point

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.178
of the limonene and the
carvone at room temperature,

00:36:12.178 --> 00:36:13.720
then we need to be
able to figure out

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.720
what the boiling point is
going to be under a vacuum.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.430
So you can use what's
called a nomograph.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.263
And there's one of these
in your lab manual,

00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:23.350
and I've reprinted it here
just to give an example of how

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.240
you use one of these.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.320
And so the way that you
can use this to calculate

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.900
your corrected boiling
point at lower pressure

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.560
is to figure out what
the pressure is that you

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.810
are doing your experiment at.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.740
So you can read, like I
said, the pressure off

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.970
of the pressure gauges
in your vacuum lines.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.210
And let's say, for example, that
you have gotten your experiment

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.820
down to about one torr.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.290
So you put it out there.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.320
And then that this is your
boiling point at 760 torr,

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.222
which is atmospheric pressure.

00:36:58.222 --> 00:37:00.680
You know that the boiling point
of whatever you're starting

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.350
with is a little bit over 300.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.950
Then you put a point there.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:06.620
And then you draw
a straight line

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.320
through those points that
intersects the observed

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.578
boiling point line.

00:37:11.578 --> 00:37:12.950
Ta-da!

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.710
And then you can find out
that your boiling point

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:20.840
at reduced pressure would be
somewhere around 120 degrees.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.050
So you can see that by
reducing the pressure down

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.050
by significantly, that we
can also significantly reduce

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.760
the boiling point so we don't
have to heat it up as much.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.040
And we can reasonably get to
these temperatures in the lab.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.900
Any questions about
how to use that?

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.810
It's pretty straightforward.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.215
So you can use that to predict
the temperatures that you will

00:37:42.215 --> 00:37:44.215
collect your limonene and
your carvone fractions

00:37:44.215 --> 00:37:46.840
so you know when to be
looking on your thermometer

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.038
to switch your fractions
and when you should

00:37:49.038 --> 00:37:50.080
be collecting which ones.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.980
And it'll help you identify
what you've collected.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.777
So that is all of
day one of the lab.

00:37:57.777 --> 00:37:59.860
If we made it through day
one of the four day lab.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.080
And so then how will
we know if it worked?

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.970
Smell it.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.820
So yeah, so part of the way
that you can tell is you

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.140
can smell it.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.247
Waft it gently, don't
ever stick your nose-- so

00:38:15.247 --> 00:38:16.830
whenever you're
trying to smell these,

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.280
even though that these are
chemicals that people eat,

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.205
be gentle.

00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:22.830
You guys know and
your TAs can show you

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.205
if you're unsure, but don't
ever stick your nose straight

00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:28.230
into a vial of any chemical.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.640
So yeah, we can check by smell.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.670
And there are a whole
host of other ways

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.520
that we are going to tell
whether you successfully

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.657
separated your two
components of your mixture.

00:38:37.657 --> 00:38:39.240
And I will leave you
with that, and we

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.540
will talk about it on Thursday
all of the different ways

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.816
you can determine your success.

00:38:45.816 --> 00:38:48.990
Are there any questions about
anything from essential oils

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.530
today?

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.490
Anything else?

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.990
Yeah.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.270
STUDENT: Do we make the
essential oil in the labs?

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.202
No.

00:38:55.202 --> 00:38:56.910
We have already gotten
it from the plant,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.130
so you don't have to do the
steam distillation part.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.630
We will hand you the oil, and
then you will just separate it

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.150
into its components.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.080
All right.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.140
See you on Thursday.

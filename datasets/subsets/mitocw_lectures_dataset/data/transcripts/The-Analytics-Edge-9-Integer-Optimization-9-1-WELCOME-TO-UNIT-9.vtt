00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.750
This week, we'll
see how optimization

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.340
can be used to find
a sports schedule

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.500
and to find a perfect
match in online dating.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.640
In the first lecture,
we'll discuss

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.860
how almost every single sports
league uses optimization

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.270
to design their
season schedules.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.560
We'll extend the idea
of linear optimization

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.700
to integer optimization,
a powerful way

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.600
to model decisions.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.290
In the second
lecture, we'll talk

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.060
about how eHarmony,
the online dating site,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.370
combines predictive models
with optimization models

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.330
to suggest matches.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.350
Let's get started.

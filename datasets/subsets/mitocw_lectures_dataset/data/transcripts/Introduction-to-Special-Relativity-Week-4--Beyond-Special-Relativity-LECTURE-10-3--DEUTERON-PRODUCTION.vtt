MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to A20 special relativity.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.150
In this section, I am going to
talk about the deuteron, which

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.450
is one of the two stable
isotopes of hydrogen.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.110
The atom is called deuterium.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.905
The nucleus actually contains
one proton and one neutron.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.310
So it's quite simple.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.090
And so we can use this as
an example to understand

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.280
the concept of
binding energy and how

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.530
we can create objects of heavier
mass or nuclei of heavier mass.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.480
We can do this by bringing
protons and neutrons together.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.340
And when we do that, they
have a likelihood of binding

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.920
together to deuterium.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.090
And they release an energy in
form of a photon of 2.3 mev

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.420
So the way to understand
is that the combination,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.210
the bound combination of
the protons and neutrons

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.270
have more favorable
energy state, which

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.070
is visible in this
nuclear potential here.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.300
So the deuteron lives as a
combination of the proton

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.040
and the neutron here.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
In order to now split up the
deuteron, which is stable,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.110
we have to add energy.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.380
We have to add at
least 2.3 mev of energy

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.920
in order to release the
proton and the neutron

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.650
and make them free.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.460
The natural abundance of
deuterium in the Earth

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.190
is rather limited with
0.0115% in the Earth.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.700
But, nevertheless, deuterium is
extremely useful and extremely

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.940
important in the
evolution of the universe,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.250
in the synthesis of
more heavier elements,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.830
as it's kind of a part
of the chain, which

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.600
allows the creation of helium.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.220
And then helium can
be used in order

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.850
to create even heavier nuclei.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.390
To give you a sense
in the numbers,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:06.290
the mass of the neutron is
2.01355 in atomic units.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.360
The mass of the
proton is about one.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.060
The mass of the neutron is a
little bit bigger, but also

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.990
about one.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.270
So in order to now get
the binding energy--

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.300
so the energy, which is kind
of stored in the deuteron, when

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.750
it's binding together,
the proton and the neutron

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.260
can be accessed by adding the
proton, and the neutron mass,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.290
and subtracting the
mass of a deuteron.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.530
Again, that's a minimal energy
needed in order to free up

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.800
the proton and the neutron.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.480
If you add more energy,
then you actually

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.810
also give kinetic energy to
the proton and the neutron

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.620
in this reaction.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.030
The deuteron was
discovered in 1934.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.850
And it's fundamental
also in production

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.270
of hydrogen bonds, which were
produced about 20 years later.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.830
So the deuteron itself is
a rather important nuclei.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.920
Again, as I said before,
it's fundamental.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.370
It's stability is fundamentally
important in nuclear synthesis

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.820
after the Big Bang.

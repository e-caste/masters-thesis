WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I'm just going

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.700
to do Venter very quickly
since we went through this so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.680
thoroughly previously.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.580
But just a few wonderful
snapshots, these are The Nature

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.440
and the Science covers.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
So Venter did Science and
Collins and the NIH Genome

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.350
Project did Nature.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830
Both published on the same day.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.470
It's kind of the truce that got
arranged between the two sides.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950
And there they are
competing with each other.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.810
And then there's
Collins on his Harley

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.390
and Venter on one of
his wild racing yachts.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.610
And Venter is only
interested in sailing if it's

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.440
dangerous is best I can figure.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.180
So and then there's this classic
picture Venter in the business

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.605
suit and wearing the lab coat.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.480
You know this is all
about the contradictions

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.190
in the model he's
trying to pursue,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.100
that fundamental
Solara contradiction.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.698
So these are just a few.

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:20.490
AUDIENCE: Who's the
dude on the motorcycle?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.240
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's Francis Collins

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.470
who's currently head of NIH,
who's also a blues singer too,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.870
by the way.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.930
So both these folks
are a little out there.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.180
They're both terrific talents.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.350
They're remarkable talents.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.940
We've talked at
length about Venter.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.140
I think that for the purposes
here, what I want to say

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.440
is that, I put Venter in here
as an example of someone who

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.670
ran into all the contradictions
in the life science innovation

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.130
model, right?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.120
The fact that it was
very hard for NIH

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.280
to look outside of biology.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.050
It was all biologists
all the time.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.530
Venter of course, was
trained as a biologist

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.740
but began moving into
this computer territory,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.039
based upon some advances that
Leroy Hood made before him

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.670
and building on Hood's work
and doing a lot of innovations

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.310
like the genome shotgun
approach that we

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.720
talked about two weeks ago.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.270
He ran into all of
the other series

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.030
of these institutional
problems at NIH

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.310
as an innovation organization.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.460
That it became very
hard for him to stand up

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.520
a completely different
pathway to technology advance

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.740
and science advance.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.530
That the system was locked
into a different route,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.450
and they were very unaccepting.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.780
In fact, ostracized him as
he moved in a different kind

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.470
of direction.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.990
So he ultimately leaves.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.620
And then we run into this
change agent kind of idea.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.440
He becomes a competitor
and forces change

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.870
in the institution
which he left as it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.070
tries to keep pace with him
so as not to be embarrassed.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.710
Hence the NIH Genome Initiative.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.740
And you know it's
just an illustration

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.920
and a very personal kind of way,
which is why I put it in here,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.560
of some of the larger
institutional challenges

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.730
that we've been
talking about before.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.360
So let me leave the
Venter model here

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.330
and go into the chapter,
chapter seven in our textbook.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.570
So it's not simply NIH, but
it's the health care delivery

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.030
system itself that has these
legacy sector features.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.100
And as we talked about
earlier on in class,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.810
the US is pretty good at
standing up new technologies

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.650
in open fields.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.527
It runs into real trouble
trying to stand up

00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:54.610
technologies in these kind
of established sectors.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.980
So in the life
science territory,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.070
we did pretty well by
creating this completely new

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.670
biotech model which was
a we were able to get

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.140
a lot of advance out of.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.020
But when it comes back to fixing
the whole health care delivery

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.260
system, that's proven
far more problematic.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.100
And you know that's been a
major thorny political issue

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.660
for three administrations
in a row now.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.270
And they've each
had rocky results

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.000
trying to pursue that question
of how we're going to organize

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.980
health care delivery systems.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.790
So there's lots of legacy sector
characteristics in health care

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.240
delivery, perverse prices
and price structures,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.640
established infrastructure
and institutional structures

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.530
like NIH, very powerful
vested interests.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.470
We can see some of those in NIH.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.410
But we can certainly see them in
other parts of the health care

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.300
delivery system.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.710
They're sustained
by public habits.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.210
Right?

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.990
So it's very hard to
tell Medicare patients

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.980
that their full cost repayment
system with no patient stake

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.260
doesn't make a lot
of economic sense.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.760
They're not going
to be enthusiastic

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.870
about the alternatives.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.780
So these are structured and
sustained by public habits.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.280
Steph?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.763
AUDIENCE: Can you
define no patient stake?

00:05:18.763 --> 00:05:20.930
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You
know Medicare is a full cost

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.640
reimbursement system.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.890
And it was organized
for medicine

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.150
as we knew it 30 or
40 years ago, right?

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.730
It was a professional
delivery system.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.690
And you would pay for the
cost of the service, whatever

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.280
that was.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.470
You would not pay for
results, because the results

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.565
in the medical system
are too uncertain.

00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:45.790
It was very hard
to figure out how

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.450
to estimate a pay for results
kind of outcomes oriented

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.460
repayment system for
these medical systems.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.130
So as a result, it became a
fee for service, full payment

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.710
system for the
medical profession.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.080
And that created
a huge incentive

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.440
to run up costs for which
the federal government would

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.810
provide you full
reimbursement, regardless

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.940
of what the outcomes were.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.030
So trying to shift
those economic signals

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.660
has proven very problematic.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.910
You know, Obamacare attempted
to change some of those,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.990
not without controversy within
the medical professions.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.760
It's averse to change
and innovation.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.680
The established
knowledge base tends

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.780
to get locked in for
the professions that

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.670
are participants here.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.290
There's a real problem
with collective action.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.800
In other words, it's
scattered amongst thousands

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.530
of institutions and getting
them to act collectively

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.810
in a different kind of
organizational model

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.460
is not simple.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.750
And there are serious
governmental and institutional

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.650
problems here.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.360
So I won't go through
the whole litany.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.070
But you begin to get a sense
of how you can take the legacy

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.280
sector analytical
framework and apply it

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.480
to a big economic sector that
service based like health care.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.570
It's not just technology
based like say energy,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.730
it's service based.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.350
But that analytical
framework will

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.770
work to a surprising extent
for both kinds of sectors.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.343
And let me go into--

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:24.510
let me go out and get this
one on the table as well,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.780
the PCAST, propelling
innovation and drug discovery.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.290
It's a very important
critique of the system

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.330
that came out in 2012.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.450
PCAST is the President's
Council of Advisors

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.800
on Science and Technology.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.050
They advise the president
on science and tech policy.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.488
We had a very strong
PCAST under Eric Lander

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:50.030
during the Obama
administration a lot

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.447
did a lot of
breakthrough reports.

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:54.830
I think frankly, this is
one of the most significant.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.560
They really took a hard look
at the health care innovation

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.658
system and identified a lot of
trouble, a lot of which we've

00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:01.700
been talking about today.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.310
But this really spelled
a fair amount of it out.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.600
So the NIH budget doubled
between '98 and 2003.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.030
It hasn't kept up with the
inflation costs since then.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.533
But in parallel,
we've had rising costs

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:16.700
of clinical trials, which
have now actually reached,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.870
according this report
$1.8 billion per drug.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.420
There's a new
patent cliff that's

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.680
looming for
pharmaceutical companies.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.290
So you may have
noticed that farmers

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.260
are busy merging and
divesting themselves

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.380
of their R&D operations.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.780
It looks like a
problematic trend.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.539
So why is this?

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.549
It's largely because of
this upcoming patent cliff.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.550
Drugs with annual sales
of $200 billion dollars

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:51.060
will go off patent between 2010
and I think it's 2015 actually.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.160
So this has already
been happening.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.730
And this has forced
a restructuring

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.720
and amongst the historic
pharmaceuticals.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.580
Replacement revenues are
not readily available.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.200
So hence this whole set
of merger activities.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.540
And they've been,
the pharmaceuticals

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.990
have been curtailing their R&D
as a result. Venture capital

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.350
at the time this was written
was in general decline

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.960
for all sectors,
including biopharma.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.950
Now frankly that's in
significant part recovered now.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.390
That's now better than it was.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.470
This tends to be a cyclical
kind of pattern for biotechs

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:31.090
in the health care area.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.560
But at this particularly
time, first time these C

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.220
deals for biotechs were down
really quite significantly.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.180
And so that's always
an issue that we're

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.473
going to have to confront.

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:44.890
In other words,
biotechs only work

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.950
if the venture capital system is
willing to be quite supportive.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.110
So ups and downs in the
venture capital sector

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.330
can have a pretty strong
effect as to whether we

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.990
get drugs emerging into the
marketplace that we need.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.910
Despite R&D growth in past
decades, drug output was flat

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.710
and productivity was declining.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.380
And this report
invented a concept

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.010
called Eroom's law, which is
the opposite of Moore's law.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.500
The cost of drug development
doubles every nine years.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.130
And the results decline.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.740
So it's the opposite
of Moore's law Martin?

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.450
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask,
so VCs function on a seven year

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.500
time cycle for an exit?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.202
So are biotech VCs
on a 20 year cycle?

00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:28.160
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.780
No.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.870
But what they will
do is they will

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.750
go with different
levels of funding,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.420
you know, A round, B round,
C round, which they'll tie--

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.260
they'll benchmark often to
the clinical trial process.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.470
So they'll be able to
manage their risk in moving

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.810
from one stage to another.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.110
And again, no other sector
has thought of this.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.690
They haven't figured out
an alternative model.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.120
The failure rate for new
drugs in clinical trials

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.780
is increasing.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.630
So as of 2003,
that was 91% fail.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.090
Imagine trying to
construct a profit model

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.680
around a 91% failure rate.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.210
It's not simple.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.000
Can still be done,
because the rewards can

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.840
be so big through the
blockbuster model.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.030
And the guarantee of
monopoly rents to the patents

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.863
that you get for it.

00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:20.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Are things
getting more stringent or are

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.333
the diseases getting harder?

00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:23.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I think it's--

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.600
you know, what am I to say?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.270
And I don't think there are
easy answers here on this, Max.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.020
I think that we've done
the low hanging fruit.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.447
And the problem is getting
much more complicated.

00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:36.780
Chris, you're nodding your head.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.520
Does that seem like
a good answer to you?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think definitely.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.490
Because like the
next frontier seems

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.420
to be like
personalized medicine,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.740
which is a huge kind
of new moving problem.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.290
Because a lot of
the difficulties

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.370
of kind of commercializing that
and kind of making that viable.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:58.010
Although there's a lot of hype
around it, which is great.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.980
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.440
AUDIENCE: Don't
get too much data.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.115
It could be that maybe
they're not doing as many?

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:06.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well maybe
now we're doing like way more.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.780
Or like, it's very easy.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.898
You know they say the
worst lies are statistics.

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yes, that's true.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.680
And all of these could be lies.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.930
AUDIENCE: Well,
it's just one way

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.430
of looking at the
problem, right?

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.730
It's a way of showcasing it.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.820
But I would want to see
the whole data to see why,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.930
the context behind it.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.290
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.630
I mean generally speaking,
this report was well received.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.463
In other words, the
experts in the community

00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:32.660
thought that this PCAST
report was on to something,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.560
that they had identified some
pretty critical problems.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.040
So time to market for drugs
has also been growing.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.130
So eight years to
market was 50 years ago

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.430
is 14 years to market now.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.080
And the longer it
takes, the more

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.192
you eat up your
monopoly rent period,

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.400
which means you've got to
make higher profits sooner,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.410
which means the short
term charges for the drugs

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.450
get higher.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.230
And you're driven
and more and more

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.090
towards a blockbuster
recovery model.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.740
So this is problematic.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.220
And you know it particularly
affects small companies

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.030
and biotechs that can't really
manage that long term risk

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.050
period.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.050
And there's a gap between
research and product

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.900
development as well.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.577
And the whole
advances in science

00:13:19.577 --> 00:13:21.410
are requiring different
kind of models here.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.175
So now there's much
more focus on-- we'll

00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:24.800
talk about convergence
in a little bit.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.890
But much more focus on
multidisciplinary teams

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.960
rather than solo individual
investigator ROI type results.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.530
You tend to have to cross
over a series of fields now

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.990
to get your medical advance out
and that's more problematic.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.810
So ideas they
propose, NCATS they

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.300
cited, the
translational medicine

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.750
entity at NIH, that
frankly has had trouble

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.030
getting enough funding
to really scale up

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:58.190
to do what it needs to do, a
DARPA type model, FDA exploring

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.700
something called
predictive toxicology,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.753
and predictive toxicity with a
lab on a chip kind of approach.

00:14:06.753 --> 00:14:08.420
In other words, there's
new technologies

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.250
that could be breakthroughs
here in trying

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.720
to solve concept problems.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.410
So let me-- let's
get through these

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.470
I think we can just
touch very briefly

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.420
on Craig Venter and
then kind of dig

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.260
into the legacy sector
reading, into the PCAST report.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.770
Just a quick question on Venter.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.200
Yeah, you got him, Good.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.360
AUDIENCE: I think
Venter's discovery

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.260
is one of the closest to
[INAUDIBLE] ethical problems.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.480
And just now we had a
discussion about how

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.980
we want to speed up of all
the research on antibiotics.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:58.290
So I want to ask, how do we
balance this raising concern,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.040
by raising concerns
of the public

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.400
all this about related
research and the need.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:12.600
There's a need for better
drugs and better discoveries,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.255
in the sense that
there is, like there

00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:22.320
is no mention the role of
media in his discovery.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.820
Is that without the media
pushing his results,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:35.910
pushing his discoveries,
his team and his work

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.440
wouldn't be approved by
this parent organization.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.960
And the kind of discussion
raised in public kind of

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.678
gave him enough
support to continue

00:15:48.678 --> 00:15:49.720
this [INAUDIBLE] process.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.280
So I would say what are
the other ways to kind

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.395
of balance this raising concerns
and this need for better drugs?

00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:04.270
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's a
very interesting point, Luyao.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.780
The fact that Venter was able
to mobilize media support, get

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.560
them to understand the potential
importance of these projects,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.660
and what the possibilities
were, in effect help drive

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.910
support for this whole
genome initiative,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.030
whether it was Venter's
or whether it was NIH's,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.890
it was a very powerful input.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.910
And we saw him and Collins on
the cover of Time Magazine.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.730
That was just one example of
the kind of media attention

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.170
on this great scientific race.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
everyone was saying,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.620
everyone has their
genetic information,

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.390
everyone was concerned.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.600
And how can this--

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.040
I mean, the future will
probably be more concerns.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.905
Is there any possible way
to address this balance?

00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:02.710
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
like change the structure so

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.089
that somebody who
has a good idea

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.730
doesn't have to like
completely go and fight

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.135
the current structure for it?

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.410
AUDIENCE: I want to
say like how do we

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.180
inform the public of this,
the potential benefits that it

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.430
brings, but also ensures
that things are under--

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.750
AUDIENCE: Are actually worth--

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.280
yes I mean, I think a lot about
like the cold fusion scandal.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.510
Where like they said
they had it to the public

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.280
so that they would
get attention for it.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.552
But like the science
wasn't super like sure.

00:17:35.552 --> 00:17:37.010
And so like there
is a huge danger,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.350
especially in the
scientific community, where

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.017
you need to make sure
something actually

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.920
works and it's been
tested by your peers

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.750
before you go public,
especially if it's

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.670
a dramatic discovery, which I
think the genomics project was.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.015
And so that is a very
hard position to be in.

00:17:51.015 --> 00:17:52.390
At the same time,
though, I think

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.713
he leveraged a good
amount of that.

00:17:55.713 --> 00:17:57.880
I think it's more about
being a little more slightly

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.250
or Machiavellian in
understanding the structure

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.080
and like who can
kill you in terms

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.505
of like credibility
or other stuff.

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:06.130
So he did a good job
of actually making

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.588
sure the science was good, kind
of having some stakeholders

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:09.970
just approve his stuff.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.530
But going to the
media and saying,

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.270
yo, this is why they're
going to mess up

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.340
and is why we're
doing pretty well.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.258
And we're kind of a
David versus Goliath.

00:18:17.258 --> 00:18:17.800
Check it out.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.510
It's pretty interesting.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.010
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
We don't usually

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:26.990
talk about the role of media in
innovation and science policy.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.570
But you are right to point
us in this direction.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:35.000
Because this was a highly
public competition.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.920
I mean as I say
here, it creates--

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.780
that competition could be viewed
as just duplicative, right?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.600
Why are private and
public resources

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.030
in effect duplicating
each other in this race?

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.670
But on the other hand, it
was incredibly creative

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.910
and it spurred both sides to
greatly accelerate and focus

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.620
on the problems.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.820
So I think the duplicative
research thesis really

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.930
doesn't work here.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.640
But the other
dimension you add here

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:12.680
is, you know, how can innovators
use public attention in helping

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.120
to drive towards their goal.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.960
And we watched in
the Boyer and Swanson

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:24.830
case, how Swanson was able
to mobilize media coverage

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.250
and hold major press conferences
when he had major announcements

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.260
to make, he and Boyer
had major announcements

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.870
to make on their team.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.300
So it's a dimension that I
don't think anybody's really

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.758
spent a lot of time looking at
in an organized kind of way.

00:19:37.758 --> 00:19:39.710
But it's a very interesting one.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.190
How does public support
affect your ability

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.795
to drive an innovation project?

00:19:48.517 --> 00:19:51.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it seems to me

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.680
that oftentimes, the
general American public only

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.900
gets really interested
in the scientific topic

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.970
when something's going really,
really badly, like epidemic, is

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.387
where people are like
hm, biology and medicine

00:20:04.387 --> 00:20:04.970
are important.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.410
Or like you know, my favorite
example of the Apollo 13

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.892
disaster was when suddenly
everyone cared about space,

00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:13.600
but only because people
were about to die

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.660
and it was exciting.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.740
So maybe some sort of response
to the science communication

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.920
problem would be getting
information out there

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.960
about the value of preventing
the ratings grabbing disasters,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.870
I guess.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.130
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
look as cool, though.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of science fiction.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.990
That's kind of the role
of science fiction.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:41.200
There's like a utility
principle that I--

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.810
her name is-- can't
remember her last name

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.810
I took a course on
bioethics last semester.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.310
It was a part of
something called

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.150
the [INAUDIBLE] seminars for
public writing at Wellesley.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.730
And this woman who was,
I guess, was coming in

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.500
to speak with us about
the role of media

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.140
in establishing bioethics,
and specifically

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.610
about genetic engineering.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.630
And one of the points that
she made to a question

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.060
that I had asked was
precisely that science fiction

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.580
plays an enormous role in
helping the public become

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.430
comfortable with scientific
advances far before the time

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.240
that those scientific advances
are even technically feasible.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.710
And so, maybe as the
scientific community, or rather

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.732
the scientific community
should do a better job

00:21:26.732 --> 00:21:28.940
of involving themselves in
the narrative storytelling

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.340
process about what science
is and has the potential

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.270
to be in order to
sort of set the stage

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.730
for those scientific
advancements when time comes.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.050
And there is I think a
huge market, thinking

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.850
about Martin's sort of business
proclivity in children's books

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.590
about science fiction,
and the ways in which we,

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.370
as maybe someday parents,
right, could be right in reading

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.070
these stories to our children
at night, having them think

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.207
about the future and
that aspect of science

00:21:58.207 --> 00:22:00.290
communication and especially
science communication

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.300
to the younger generations
which will inherit

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.030
the kinds of innovations
that we create today,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.280
are immensely important.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.080
But there's not a
lot of storytellers

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.150
who are equipped with
the technical knowledge

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.880
in order to communicate
that adequately in a way

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.710
that's palatable to
children and it's also

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.682
palatable to their parents and
to the broader American market.

00:22:18.682 --> 00:22:20.390
So I think it's really
important to think

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.000
about this sort of storytelling
dimensions of science

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.660
communication, not just in the
sense of, what's in the news,

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.300
or what's going to
be in the newspapers,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.210
but how we are
orienting ourselves

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.585
to make this an issue
we care about socially.

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:41.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I like the
idea of preparing the stage so

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.270
that people are receptive to
advancements when they happen,

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.130
and not just the scientist
makes a discovery

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.950
and then suddenly is trying to
drum up support for something

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.930
that they have to explain,
A, why it's important first

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.930
of all, and then, B, why
what they've discovered

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.675
is the relevant.

00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:55.550
You make good points.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.092
AUDIENCE: Do you
remember who came up

00:22:57.092 --> 00:22:59.060
with the rockets, the
original rocket that

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.507
came from like Germany?

00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:01.340
AUDIENCE: Von Braun.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:01.890
AUDIENCE: Von Brian.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.200
Yeah, so that's a
pretty good example.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.617
Because von Braun
was having a lot

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:07.220
of difficulty getting funding
for the rockets originally.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.950
So what he did is he
wrote a letter to Disney,

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.230
because he was a foreigner.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.173
He was German, so like no one
wanted him to actually do it.

00:23:14.173 --> 00:23:15.590
And they were kind
of stifling him

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.360
and they put him in
a research facility

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.740
where he wasn't
really doing anything.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.532
So he wrote Disney.

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:22.790
Disney does a whole thing
on space [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.290
But I think it's
an important aspect

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.170
in terms of really, who are you
stakeholders as a scientist.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.270
You don't have-- unless
you're like a billionaire,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.230
and even if you
are a billionaire,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.980
you don't have the
power to manipulate--

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.300
you're not like the president.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.800
So you have to be
able to figure out

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.387
how you're going
to persuade people

00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:38.720
and how you're going to use
those different stakeholders

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.950
in a very interesting-- well,
in a very sort of pseudo

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.210
Machiavellian but
smart way, right?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.290
And how do you play
the politics well?

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.790
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So maybe there's

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.490
an amendment to the
legacy sector book

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.740
that we've been using
as our textbook, which

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.260
is part of the role of change
agents is to use the media

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.340
and to do storytelling.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.260
Because this was a great story.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.140
This was an amazing story,
which people in the United

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.570
States and the world followed
for a significant period

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.170
of time, this great rivalry.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.810
And you know, Venter is
almost made for media

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:18.710
as a wonderful maverick, you
know, fascinating character.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.980
And Collins is as well.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.940
So there was a powerful
story to be told here

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.880
and a great competition
and a great race that

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.340
made it a very powerful
kind of media story

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.390
for an extended period of time.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.460
So Louis, I had not anticipated
this tangent of the course.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.882
But thanks for
pulling us into it.

00:24:36.882 --> 00:24:38.840
So let me go on to the
next couple of readings.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.210
So our textbook, who's got that?

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.330
Chloe, all yours.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.080
AUDIENCE: So to set the stage
for maybe the first question

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.580
here.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.410
I went to a talk recently
by a robotics entrepreneur,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.810
which seems unrelated.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.390
But I think he gave
an interesting lesson

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.652
as it relates, could
relate to health care.

00:25:01.652 --> 00:25:03.860
He was talking about the
problem he was dealing with,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.280
which was using robotics
as an organizational tool

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.870
in warehouses.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.850
And it wasn't interesting
to me at first.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.225
But he made the problem pretty
interesting after a while.

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:15.980
But the way that he framed
dealing with his problems

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.660
was that he practice having
the mindset of evaluating

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.240
the problem at zero and
infinity, as he said.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.245
Which basically translated to
removing all constraints that

00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:30.370
were pre-existing on the
system and then seeing you

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.500
know if he had infinite space
or infinite money or infinite

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.010
labor, what he could accomplish
or what his engineering

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.090
solutions would be.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.540
And it was a really good
way to sort of brainstorm

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.110
an optimal solution
to his problem.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.860
So I think it would
be interesting to take

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.300
the same approach to the
inherent problems in health

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.050
care delivery as
a legacy sector.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.770
If we could-- like,
you made the point

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.780
that when you are recapping
this chapter that our system is

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.690
currently designed
to suit medicine

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.970
as it existed I guess
30 or 40 years ago,

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.120
but not as it is moving into
this exciting brave new world

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.780
today.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.400
So if we could wipe
the slate clean

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.570
and not have any of
the residual costs,

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.760
like everyone started
out healthily today.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.610
No one had any illness and we
didn't have any residual costs

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.470
or anything, like
perfect ideal world,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.480
and we had to redesign
our health care

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.110
system from the ground
up, and --I know

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.360
this is a massive question.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.910
But I'm just interested
in what you guys think

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:28.950
that might look like.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.460
Like what would our
innovation in that area

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.830
look like we had no constraints.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.523
AUDIENCE: I mean
obviously, you'd

00:26:35.523 --> 00:26:37.190
have a bunch of
pharmaceutical companies

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.310
would be producing
infinite drugs,

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.760
because they have tons of money.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.240
But from there, I think you'd
have a significant bottleneck

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.230
in terms of the FDA.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.620
So you'd have to expand
that significantly.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.533
AUDIENCE: I don't
necessarily mean like they

00:26:50.533 --> 00:26:51.700
have the infinite resources.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.660
It's just like if we were
starting to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.493
AUDIENCE: Create a
completely perfect system

00:26:55.493 --> 00:26:57.843
for this time and the next
50 years, how would we do it?

00:26:57.843 --> 00:26:58.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.360
AUDIENCE: I mean, you
want me to give you

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.700
an answer of how to structure
or how to figure out

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.890
what the process is?

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.432
AUDIENCE: Just I guess, elements
of what it might look like.

00:27:07.432 --> 00:27:08.890
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think a lot of it

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.010
falls in what Chris
was talking about

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.590
and what Bill was talking
about, the personalized medicine

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.347
component.

00:27:13.347 --> 00:27:14.930
That's kind of how
they're touting it.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.060
It's the fundamental
reorganization

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.630
of health care delivery.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.397
And one of the ways
in which they're--

00:27:22.397 --> 00:27:24.230
I guess, my understanding
is that the sector

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.270
is purporting to
make that happen is

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.768
through additive manufacturing.

00:27:27.768 --> 00:27:29.060
So the 3D printing [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.148
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to say that.

00:27:32.148 --> 00:27:33.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, 3D printing

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.450
is going to be useful in
a lot of health areas.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.760
So there's a new
manufacturing institute

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.080
that's organized around
regenerative medicine

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.930
and tissue engineering,
for example,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.590
using 3D printing as one of the
technologies they're looking at

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.660
and combining that
with synthetic biology.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.050
That's a very interesting and
potentially very promising

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.490
territory.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.430
As we'll get into in the next
reading, that's not biology,

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.130
right?

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.130
That's a whole series of new
engineering strands that are

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.840
starting to enter
, and IT strands,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.880
that are starting to
enter this territory.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.650
And how does a system that's
not organized around that,

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.617
change to accommodate
those strands?

00:28:13.617 --> 00:28:15.450
AUDIENCE: Well I think
the container section

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.780
of sort of the
pharmaceutical industry

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.295
and engineering, one of the
most interesting articles

00:28:21.295 --> 00:28:23.670
that I read recently, was
about the ways in which they're

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.310
printing the pills in
order to be better adapted

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:35.160
to the person's absorption
of the medicine.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.260
So they sort of--

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.720
they're starting to
develop ways to gauge

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.710
what a pill needs to look like
for an individual to ingest it

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.250
and also for the medicine to
be delivered into their body.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.913
And They can't do that
in mass manufacturing.

00:28:49.913 --> 00:28:51.830
They can only do that
in personalized medicine

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.250
through additives.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.965
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:28:54.965 --> 00:28:57.090
So that would be an answer
to your question, right?

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.550
That exists and does not
require an idealized world.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.120
It would just require the sort
of commercialization process

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.690
and then the scaling up of
what exists potentially,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.367
if it's not to be thwarted
by the legacy sector.

00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:11.700
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So the
traditional production system

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:17.700
for you know medicines is
a batch processing system.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.910
You build a huge batch
and you refine it

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.980
so it has the perfect
composition spread

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.480
evenly throughout.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.620
And then you produce that.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.420
But that's frankly, not a
modern manufacturing technology.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.540
So a continuous
manufacturing process

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.050
is much more flexible,
potentially much more modular

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:43.170
and adaptive to different
components in that system, i.e.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.250
Different elements and a
different molecular structures

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.520
and different components within
a particular drug or a pill.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.540
And 3D printing is a very
interesting adaptive approach.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.070
So DARPA has been funding
desktop pharmaceutical

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.443
manufacturing with
exactly that in mind.

00:30:05.443 --> 00:30:07.860
That we're going to have to
move to personalized medicine.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.670
The military is going to have to
have it for its own huge health

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.210
care system, which is funded to
the tune of about $50 billion

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.820
a year, a major medical system.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.155
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
That's 10 arc reactors.

00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:25.470
I'll take it.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.050
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well it's
a very large medical system.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.870
And they're having to deal
with changes and reforms

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.880
in their own system,
so they're moving

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.748
on developing a whole new set
of production technologies.

00:30:35.748 --> 00:30:37.290
And on that one,
they've been working

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.770
within an MIT team that's
really quite interesting.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.100
But that again, NIH
doesn't do this.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.260
That's not in NIH's territory.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.080
It happened that the military
was interested in this.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.200
This new DARPA biological
technologies office

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.080
happens to be intrigued with
those set of possibilities.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.850
But that's kind of outside the
box of the existing system.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.750
AUDIENCE: So, plug and
play manufacturing,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.352
plug and play
personalized medicine?

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:07.060
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Good phrasing, Chloe.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.893
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:12.562 --> 00:31:13.520
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.020
I think we're going
to have to focus

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.647
on the new sexy technologies,
focus more on the structure.

00:31:18.647 --> 00:31:21.230
Because I think like, say I have
to use the technology that we

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.772
have now, I would
think about how I'd

00:31:22.772 --> 00:31:24.990
restructure the organization.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.310
What are the problems and are
they caused by incentives?

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.750
So I think this
health care crisis

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.030
isn't a problem of technology
or even people or even doctors.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.270
I think it's an
issue of incentives.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.460
So when I say I'm going
to pay whatever you do,

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.850
I'm like, oh well, let's stack
it on, add more toppings.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.060
And like, I end up
having a huge bill.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.520
And then also, as a
generation, where now we

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.060
have a huge kind of--

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.125
I don't-- we have a lot more
elders than young people.

00:31:51.125 --> 00:31:53.000
And so we have to pay
for these baby boomers.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.830
So it ignores that context.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.200
So we also might want
to focus on probably

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.850
like most of our
costs are going to go

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.582
to elders, not young people,
because young people are fine.

00:32:01.582 --> 00:32:03.290
We have a huge portion
of elders, so what

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.600
are their diseases?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.660
How do they work?

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.550
What are the main causes
of those diseases?

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.633
And how do I create my
organization around that?

00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:12.050
Or maybe I just want to create
a whole new medical system,

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.550
focus on this segment
because I know

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.340
that they're going to be
huge, you know, costs.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.920
And I can get you
know, laws of economics

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.800
by having such a
large segment that's,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.815
like that whole system
is personalized for them.

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:25.190
And they have different needs
than somebody who is young.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.600
Who can just take an
Uber or something.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.270
Yeah.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.603
For them, you probably have
to have somebody go directly

00:32:31.603 --> 00:32:34.220
to them, check how they're
doing, check constant levels.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.200
So it's very different.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.090
And I think that
could cut costs down.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.320
Or you could send
somebody out to them.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.962
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Or use
an IT system or use robotics.

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.670
Those are all part of
the menu that we're

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.730
starting to think
about Chloe, a closing

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.535
thought about this
reading on legacy sectors?

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.180
I think for me,
it was really eye

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.880
opening to see the
part of the reading

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.600
where you just listed
the five or six specific

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.090
characteristics of how health
care delivery draws parallels

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.020
to legacy sectors.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.930
And I think those are
probably the areas where

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.900
any sort of reformers
or innovators

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.670
would really hone
in on and focus

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:26.600
on lifting those restrictions
to limber up the system a lot.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.150
Let's go to the PCAST report.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:39.870
AUDIENCE: Regarding this
research, the drug development.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.120
We were just
talking about how do

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.190
we incentivize firms
to take on more

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:54.350
responsibility in developing
some drugs that target minority

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.470
groups or that don't
have such a big market.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:02.980
And I want to introduce this
model that Singapore has in

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.159
incentivizing their small and
medium sized firms to invest

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.460
in R&D and trainings.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:16.580
What they do is, you
can get a tax return

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:22.120
or you can get a
set amount of funds

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:28.580
as long as you are
investing in your employees

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:35.480
or in any forms of training that
can improve your productivity

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.889
and improves your
research in any form.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.130
And I think Singapore was
able to do that because they

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:48.020
are really small scale.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.010
And they also count on
their small and medium sized

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.889
businesses to thrive
as the economy.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.640
But I want to know
if this kind of model

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.950
can be a good reference
to develop the health care

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.720
research sector in the US.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.067
If you have any--

00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:13.400
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So the
model Singapore is using then

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.030
is to give an
incentive to companies

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.240
that are making significant
investments in the training

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.410
of their employees and
their research teams

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.440
to kind of significantly
upgrade their skill sets.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.960
AUDIENCE: And they have
give a lot of flexibility.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.140
As long as you can justify
this amount of spending,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.960
or able to improve
your productivity,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.548
they get this funding.

00:35:41.548 --> 00:35:43.590
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's
what you have to show.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.970
You have to show some kind of
increased performance coming

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.820
out of that.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.090
AUDIENCE: So what
are your thoughts

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:58.500
about this kind of approach that
could kind of encourage a drug

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.466
developments?

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So that's interesting.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.790
So that's like a roamer
technology talent approach

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.490
into a discussion we've
been having on institutional

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.200
innovation organization.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.350
So it's again, you bring
us an interesting piece

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.880
of the puzzle.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.380
I like it.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.920
So let's go back to basics.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.690
Is there a talent
need in this sector?

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.010
Is there a talent shortage?

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.880
Is there a talent
enthusiasm issue

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.970
here that we ought to
be addressing as well?

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.120
AUDIENCE: From what I've
seen in my very limited

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.580
biotech experience, it
seems like there isn't

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.870
really much of a shortage.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.890
It seems like there's a lot of
enthusiasm around the field.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.890
And like, as has
been a continuing

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.070
theme this class, our
good old American spirit

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.520
and our entrepreneurial drive
toward packing up and moving

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.680
out West or in this case west
is genetic engineering and all

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.010
that good stuff.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.150
So I don't know if the
drive is really the problem.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.890
AUDIENCE: I just think about--

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:24.390
I like to think about analogies.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.550
And often in urban
planning, you know,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.398
people compare
Scandinavian countries

00:37:29.398 --> 00:37:30.440
to the rest of the world.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.730
And say, well, why
can't we be like them?

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.260
And there's various
factors that we

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.177
don't take into
consideration, the homogeneity

00:37:36.177 --> 00:37:38.168
of the population, their
productive capacity,

00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:39.960
the resources they have
accessible to them,

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.210
the scale at which
they're operating,

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.545
maybe their colonial history
and the ways in which they

00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:46.920
were able to sort of take
advantage of some opportunities

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.295
that we might not be able
to as a country, et cetera.

00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:50.670
And so in this
instance, I'd like

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.960
to sort of invoke that and cross
apply that argument to sort

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.640
of Luyao's point
about Singapore,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.440
and then to really utilize
that to challenge what Max just

00:37:59.440 --> 00:37:59.940
said.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.510
Because I feel like
we are situated

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.200
in a very unique and
incredible location

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.240
for this kind of conversation.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.540
But where I'm from in Texas,
the kinds of university systems

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.238
and research system
that exist there,

00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:15.780
these kinds of
conversations probably

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.370
don't happen to that extent.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.410
And the enthusiasm
for commercialization

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.130
is probably not
to the same level.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.340
And so I think I would
come back to what

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.830
Max is saying specifically,
by saying that perhaps we

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:34.590
need to then bring something,
in a way, usual socialist ways,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:39.510
to say that perhaps it is the
kinds of talent that is missing

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.880
or rather, people from
marginalized groups

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:48.250
may have a decidedly public
good approach to research.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.848
And so they might not want to
commercialize in the same ways

00:38:50.848 --> 00:38:52.890
that people who are being
trained in institutions

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.570
like MIT and Stanford are.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.017
And it is perhaps
that it is precisely

00:38:57.017 --> 00:38:59.100
those people who the
government should be funding,

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.470
not major research
universities that

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.890
exist within a
commercialization framework.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.590
Because those
individuals are less

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.350
likely to want to take the
bigger piece of the pie

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.660
and may potentially want
to benefit and serve

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.820
their communities
much more, which

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.840
could prove to be much
more disruptive ultimately.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Who wants to
take on Steph's economic model?

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.820
[LAUGHING]

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.485
Plenty of volunteers.

00:39:23.485 --> 00:39:25.610
AUDIENCE: One, you directly
challenged me and you--

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.020
AUDIENCE: Please,
please, please, please.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.650
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean,
it's nice and idealistic.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.400
I love thinking that,
OK, everyone is just

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.710
going to work for free.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.127
AUDIENCE: Oh I
don't think they're

00:39:35.127 --> 00:39:36.315
going to work for free, Max.

00:39:36.315 --> 00:39:37.440
That's not the insinuation.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.150
The insinuation is that the
profit sharing is going to--

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.650
the.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:46.830
Profit sharing model is going
to be much different I mean,

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.300
I'm not going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.040
AUDIENCE: OK, so I
understood it as they

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.370
don't care about making
big fish blockbuster drugs

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.300
or we'll make like the drugs
that are like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.730
AUDIENCE: They can make the
big fish blockbuster drugs.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.340
They just don't want to profit
to that extent, which ends up

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.540
being good for everyone.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.620
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.200
So them not profiting
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.400
AUDIENCE: But the thing is,
you could take the other side.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.910
The company's
profiting means they

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.270
can put that research-- put
that money toward new drugs,

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.190
as opposed to just
develop one drug

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.600
and then you
basically break even.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.510
Then you're just like,
what do I do now?

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.010
AUDIENCE: I think
the focus on drugs

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.135
maybe also kind of limited.

00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:23.790
Like I guess we still want
more drugs, that's fine.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.250
But I think they have
drugs that are targeted

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.830
towards like, maybe if--

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.830
I guess we talked about
like a disease portfolio

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.060
that they look at
and it's very narrow.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.730
And so there's two things here.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:41.160
So I wonder if such proposals
might help expand that disease

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.730
portfolio.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.070
So you have people who
care about more diseases

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.610
and are able to do more research
in sort of different areas.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.320
And then two, I wonder if
those who actually subscribe

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.330
to this sort of, let's say big
pharma look kind of like we're

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.990
in this age, FDA, drug an
incremental advance type

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:05.947
system, do they actually
care to the extent

00:41:05.947 --> 00:41:07.280
that someone's trying to get at.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.920
Like are they
actually interested

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.550
in kind of solving this
incremental advance problem

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.490
or do they have a vested
interest in what they're

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.260
doing because they care about
these sort of bigger fish,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.860
like kind of cure all drugs?

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.110
But they don't have the
funding opportunities and kind

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.250
of the means to kind
of get [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.460
AUDIENCE: The way
institutions are specifically

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.080
cited by the
conversions reading,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.360
I think kind of really proved
sort of where I'm coming from.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.030
They cited a Harvard,
University of Texas

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.370
at Austin, Carnegie Mellon,
George Tech, U Chicago,

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.450
and Tufts, obviously
you know without saying,

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.750
MIT, because most of the
people on that commission

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.600
had some relationship time or
were researchers that graduated

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.840
from MIT, were
professors that MIT,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.640
were prominent political
stakeholders at MIT.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.460
So you know it occurs
to me that there if, it

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.830
is that we you know really
revere people like Craig

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.980
Venter, and, if it is that
the convergence reading, which

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.820
we will be talking
about soon enough,

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.250
is putting a lot of weight
on the potential of community

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.470
colleges and of
local institutions

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.390
to train the workforce
in the life sciences,

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.890
why is it that we don't give
them the same access to funding

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.050
opportunities that
we're giving you know,

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.637
the sort of blockbuster
research universities?

00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:35.750
AUDIENCE: I think the
big thing is like,

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.840
so it seems like a lot-- this
is like a easy mental model

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.642
for most people.

00:42:39.642 --> 00:42:41.850
What they do is they think
about everything linearly.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.358
So the thing is
like MIT, Harvard,

00:42:43.358 --> 00:42:45.650
and luxury institutions just
have a huge conglomeration

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.250
of people.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.750
So they're exponentially
much better

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.070
at solving certain problems.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.710
And they have the credibility
to go and get funding

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.990
from outside sources,
whether it be government,

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.580
whether it be VC, so it
is this huge you know,

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.310
very unproportional
nature of the institutes

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.620
and the way the system works.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.470
But there are some
good things to that.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.690
What I worry more is like how
do you create a new system

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.290
to make all these smaller
drugs and working on them

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.370
more viable.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.770
So I think that's an
interesting place for a startup,

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.680
if you can figure out
3D printing of drugs

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.470
or if you can figure
out what is your kind

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.325
of your competitive
advantage in this problem.

00:43:24.325 --> 00:43:25.700
And what is the
current structure

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.830
for the company that
focus on the big pharma.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.540
And how do you
optimize for that.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.150
So what are so it's pretty
much like Art of War.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.225
It's like, OK, they already
have their strategy.

00:43:35.225 --> 00:43:37.100
They have to focus on
doing business with us.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.142
And there's also called
the intervention dilemma,

00:43:39.142 --> 00:43:41.780
which is like they
have to make $5 billion

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.340
in revenue off of this drug.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.280
I don't need to make
$5 million in revenue.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.580
I'm a smaller fish.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.100
I could, with like
$5 million, right?

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.500
So like how do I create my
systems so that I can make

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.893
these kind of drugs and
make a big company based

00:43:53.893 --> 00:43:55.310
on focusing on
those smaller drugs

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.120
that are important to society.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.240
That would be like the
enterprise version.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.180
You can probably come up with
some parallel using government

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.520
funding and government support.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.735
And maybe it might be that
FDA approval, being more lax,

00:44:07.735 --> 00:44:09.110
or depending on
the drug, I would

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.068
have to figure out which
ones are the best ones

00:44:11.068 --> 00:44:13.500
to go after in the beginning.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.250
But I don't think, except
making the argument

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.200
that, oh how do we, you know, I
don't want to say democratize,

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.118
but why can't everybody
like be in the pool?

00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:24.660
Especially when it's
like those there

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.160
are people that are
Olympic swimmers

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.283
and like institutes that--

00:44:27.283 --> 00:44:29.450
I mean there are probably
good high school swimmers,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.260
but like it just won't you
won't get as much a run through

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.090
of the same--

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.632
AUDIENCE: I guess
it just concerns me

00:44:35.632 --> 00:44:38.750
that we pay so much lip service
to the great groups model.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.770
And the great group model itself
says that the drive for profit

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:47.420
is not the greatest
motivator to innovation.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:52.100
And if we are to
consider that as true

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.160
or to take that at face value
in the ways in which the authors

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.490
have presented their argument
in the previous weeks,

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.290
I don't know that
the commercialization

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:03.380
model for the life
sciences is necessarily

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.740
conducive to innovations in
the ways in which we would

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.240
hope that they would exist.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.782
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So, Steph, you're

00:45:09.782 --> 00:45:14.630
driving us towards obviously
some truly big picture issues.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:21.920
Look, we have taken a pretty
radical capitalist model

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.520
to solving this problem of
innovation in life science,

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.260
right?

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.450
It's pretty amazing
that we have focused

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:36.790
on a high risk, high
reward system that's

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.340
completely dependent
upon you know,

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.140
monopoly rents and major returns
as the way in which we're

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.570
going to do innovation in
the life science territory.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.880
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.010
How did we stumble into this?

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:56.570
That wasn't what-- remember
when we talked about Boyer

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.960
and the conflicts he had
with other UCSF faculty?

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.280
When he went off to invent the
biotech model with Swanson,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.960
he got a lot of flack for this.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.510
That was a radical departure.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.510
He was leaving a university
based research system.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:16.650
But let's think back to the
reasons why he was doing that.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.740
Because he wanted
his technologies

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.350
to scale up and be available
and that was the option

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.180
that he saw for being
able to do that,

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.072
so he teams up with Swanson.

00:46:26.072 --> 00:46:28.530
I don't think we're going to
resolve these questions today.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.800
But it is a radical
capitalist model.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.690
And as we've discussed
at length today,

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.790
there are gaps in
that model, right?

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.830
There's only some
things that that model

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.320
is going to be able
to address given

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.270
the structural limits
that are coming into it,

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.840
particularly the long
term approval process

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.730
that the FDA has to provide.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.670
So you know, drug
companies hate the FDA

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.670
because they have to spend
seven years and $1.8 billion

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.470
getting through their hurdles.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:47:00.450
But they also love FDA because
it certifies their products

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.070
and guarantees a
market for them.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.890
So it's this odd love
hate relationship.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.810
In some ways that's
symptomatic of what we've

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.690
got over this whole system.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:14.050
And it is a system under
stress at this point.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.680
Luyao why don't you give us a
closing point on this and then

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.138
we'll go right into what I
think the next part of the story

00:47:19.138 --> 00:47:19.920
is on convergence.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.400
Because I think it
fits nicely with this.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.630
AUDIENCE: I realize we do focus
on a lot of how to incentivize

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.740
innovation in drug development.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.830
But I do think that
you know we still

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:37.380
have this scarcity problem
with rising demand and limited

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:38.650
supply.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.860
Why don't we also divert
a little bit of focus

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.130
on developing a
healthy population.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:53.040
Can any form of drug
development and kind of research

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.740
that advance this
process, so that we

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.580
can reduce the unnecessary
demand for certain type

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.810
of health care.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.740
So that we can free up a bit
of our funding and resources

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:09.600
so that we can focus on the
rest of the research programs.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
look, your point earlier,

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:18.620
which we debated about, is
there a talent problem here?

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.792
Romer's prospector
theory would tell us,

00:48:22.792 --> 00:48:24.500
you're going to get
a lot more innovation

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.850
if you put more well-trained
prospectors on the problem,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:27.350
right?

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.982
So I don't want us to
kind of leave that point.

00:48:29.982 --> 00:48:31.940
I think there's an
interesting underlying point

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.235
you made in that area as well.

00:48:35.235 --> 00:48:37.235
All right, let's go on
to the convergence study.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.170
The report is called
"The Third Revolution

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.295
- The Convergence Of Life,
Physical and Engineering

00:48:46.295 --> 00:48:46.830
Sciences."

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.400
And it came out of MIT in 2011.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.970
You know my office, the
MIT Washington office,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:54.900
helped work on this.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.020
The project was led by
Phil Sharpe and Bob Langer,

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.420
somebody from engineering,
somebody from biology,

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.850
obviously two of
MIT's all time greats.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:09.750
And the report tries
to tell a story

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:14.220
that the picture in the
next advance wave, we're

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.470
lacking a picture of the
next wave of advance.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.260
The great thing the
genomes piece gave

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.080
us and we talked about
Venter and the competition

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.073
with Collins and the
NIH, it gave us a story,

00:49:25.073 --> 00:49:26.490
it gave us a picture
of what we're

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:31.160
going to get for this
massive investment in NIH.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.130
It enabled the public to see
a story and be told a story

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.220
and understand what the results
were going to yield, right?

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.910
We don't have a story
for the life sciences

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:46.380
that's out there now that
has nearly the kind of power

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.640
as that genomic story.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.580
We haven't figured out how
to tell the next story.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.440
And that's part
of the reason why

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.900
we've got funding
stagnation for NIH

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.900
and the life
sciences in general.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.540
So the doubling was led by
the genomics revolution.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.053
NIH needs a new picture.

00:50:02.053 --> 00:50:03.720
So what are these
different revolutions?

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.750
So what this report
argued was that really

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.320
the kind of first
revolution in recent time

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.120
was the molecular
biology revolution.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.930
And that was really the
merger of physics and biology.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:21.360
So Max Delbruck comes out of the
amazing pre-war German physics

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.550
community.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:30.630
He works with Niels
Bohr in Copenhagen

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.540
as part of that
amazing community that

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.750
were living in Bohr's
house, being trained by him.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:40.140
Bohr produces this
amazing talent team

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.970
and this is the
second generation.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.690
This is you know
Bohr and Einstein are

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.450
an earlier generation and
Marie Curie and so forth.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.130
This is the next generation out.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.020
How are they going to
find their project?

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.940
What's their
project going to be?

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.830
And Bohr kind of urges Delbruck,
why don't you look at biology.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.680
We're coming along up with
a lot of physics here.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.990
Is there a way of
applying that to biology?

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:08.340
And Delbruck does this and has
to come to the United States.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.670
He has to flee Germany
on the eve of the war.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.780
And in turn,
Salvadore Luria, he is

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.780
working with Enrico Fermi
at the University of Rome.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.220
He's a medical doctor.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.200
He's trained in medicine.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.300
And he is fascinated
with physics.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.450
So he goes to work for Fermi,
working on particle physics

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.330
issues.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.190
So these are two
people that actually

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:37.032
lead this whole molecular
biology revolution, in part

00:51:37.032 --> 00:51:39.240
because they're doing this
crossover thing that we've

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.070
talked about before.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.890
They're taking physics and
moving it into this new biology

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.760
territory with a whole
new raft of ideas

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.120
that help mature and create
all kinds of new thinking

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:52.880
in biology.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.980
And it really leads to
molecular biology, right?

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.610
You know, the second revolution
is really genome sequencing.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.840
We've talked a lot
about that already.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.550
But essentially, that's another
one of these crossovers, right?

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:11.300
That's taking
advances in computing

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.960
and certain other kind
of physical science areas

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.600
and then bringing
them into biology

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.590
and creating a whole new set
of applications in the biology

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.980
field that are in
turn transformative.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.160
So that's a second crossover.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.440
The third revolution--
here, by the way,

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.220
are some of the earlier
revolution leaders.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.540
So that's Salvadore Luria,
one of MIT'S greats,

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.770
Nobel Prize winner.

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:41.050
That's Luria and Delbruck
teamed up together

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:46.720
on the back porch of I think
some Long Island beach resort.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.430
Luria works in
Cold Spring Harbor.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.490
But that's you know, that's
an amazing talent team.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:57.640
And they really do create the
intellectual underpinnings

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.560
for molecular biology.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.110
That's Leroy Hood, inventor
who you're familiar with.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.760
That's Eric Lander.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.330
They're leaders in
the second revolution,

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:12.340
the great genomic revolution,
another crossover approach.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.730
And then we've got this
whole new community.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.560
I've featured the
MIT parts of it.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.400
But this revolution is
happening at many other schools.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.640
But this is just the
community that we're used to.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.890
So Phil Sharp on the
left and Bob Langer,

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.920
who are the leaders on
this particular report.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.450
Tyler Jacks who leads
the Koch Institute here.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:41.710
Paul Hammond, who is chairman
of the biochemistry department,

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:42.490
no.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.390
AUDIENCE: Chem E.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.557
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Chemical
engineering department.

00:53:45.557 --> 00:53:48.310
But is doing an enormous amount
of research in the life science

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.720
side.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.050
Susan Hockfield is president
at Sangeeta Bhatia, who's

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.790
doing amazing work on cancer.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:03.610
You know, it's an incredible
community of talent,

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:07.120
again from a whole series
of different kind of fields.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.090
It's another crossover.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.790
It's engineering and
physical sciences

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:16.630
and computational sciences
entering into the life science

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:19.930
space with a whole new set
of disciplinary perspectives,

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:23.620
a whole new set of systems
perspectives, a whole new way

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.110
of thinking about how
to organize research.

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:27.940
And so this is
the MIT community.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.210
You could duplicate this
at other schools as well.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:39.070
But it's a set of engineering
tools are going to come here,

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:43.360
but also a whole concept of
engineering design comes here.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.160
So, life science systems tends
to look at that complexity.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.900
They tend to look
at complex systems

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:58.100
and attempt to understand the
elements in complex systems.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.800
That's the kind of way,
the frame that biologists

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.210
work from.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:04.450
Engineering works in a
very different kind of way.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.370
It attempts to organize in
a very hierarchical fashion

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.650
and set priorities.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:11.420
Engineering design is
a very different way

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.450
of looking at the world.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:15.560
So these two fundamental
different perspectives

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.810
now have the opportunity
of coming together here,

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:21.920
for what becomes actually a
very different kind of research

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.480
model.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:33.320
So there will be new
knowledge bases here that

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.820
come about as a result of this.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.030
Just as genomics gave us a
whole new knowledge base,

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.270
just as molecular biology gave
us a whole new knowledge base,

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.390
the convergence of
these different fields

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.890
is going to create a
new knowledge base.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.120
But convergence is
somewhat different.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.620
Because it's also, particularly
through the engineering side,

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:58.610
it could lead us to a whole new
set of therapeutic advances.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.120
So new technologies shift
over from engineering

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.810
in areas like imaging sensors,
nanotechnology, simulation

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:09.800
modeling, probability,
these are all kind

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.590
of engineering led sides
of things that can now

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.690
walk into the biology space.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.970
So this report at MIT kind of
laid a lot of the groundwork.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:22.940
And frankly Susan
Hockfield saw the promise

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.060
of what these folks
were writing about

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:30.470
and created you know
just, up the road from us

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.260
created the Koch
Institute, so that we

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.810
were walking the walk
at the same time we

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.000
were talking the talk here.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.230
So that Koch Institute
was under way

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.660
before this report
was even finished,

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.600
because it was just so clear
that this was an incredibly

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.590
promising set of new research
opportunities that were going

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:52.820
to create a lot of real
breakthrough spaces

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.380
in the life sciences.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:59.450
So there's a whole
series of strands

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:01.520
that we had already
seen, that you could

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.430
call convergence-like
strands, so synthetic biology

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:09.050
and nano biology and systems
biology, bioinformatics,

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:11.570
computational biology,
tissue engineering, these

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:16.010
were all kind of strands at MIT
and in life sciences generally.

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.840
And the idea of convergence
was, ah, these things

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.330
are doing similar things.

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.850
We can understand this
in a larger kind of way

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:25.250
and take more creative
advantage of it.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.760
So will convergence play a
role in the medical costs

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.970
problems that we've
been talking about?

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.640
We talked about the lack of
incentives for cost controls

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.280
in the system.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:47.950
So far, we've been thinking
about health care as a,

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.880
like rearranging the kind of
financial plumbing, right?

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.640
Could we create different kinds
of cost structures and cost

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.105
incentives and so forth.

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.730
There is another
potential answer here,

00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.688
and it's back to the
prospector theory in a way

00:57:59.688 --> 00:58:01.650
that you were suggesting.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:04.530
Maybe there are innovation
answers here too, right?

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.480
In other words, if
you get a whole series

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.300
of innovation based
advances, that

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.020
can tackle a lot
of these problems.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:16.260
So for example, you
know, NIH working away

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.690
in supporting life
science research

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:23.460
really enabled huge progress
against heart disease, which

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.860
you know, is breathtaking
and really moved

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.690
heart disease down a notch
from a nightmare killer

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:33.030
to much more manageable
health problem.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.690
And that's occurred
in the last 25 years.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.170
If you do that in
a number of areas,

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.430
you can really start to
affect the whole kind of cost

00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.930
structure.

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:47.520
And particularly, could
you have healthier aging?

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.790
So one part of the dilemma
for the current demographics

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.400
challenge that's
going to be upon you,

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.730
is keeping my generation
in the workforce

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:02.280
longer with returns that
are going into society.

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.560
Can you make me
and my generation

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.790
work longer, generating returns
that get distributed to all?

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.890
That would solve
a lot of problems.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:13.780
That helps us, rather
than walking off a cliff,

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.290
it helps it manage
much more of a curve.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.820
So if we could do that,
that would be powerful.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.730
And may be that some of these
convergence space technologies

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.340
can really be significant
enablers in ways

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.940
that we kind of
never saw before.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.400
So that's an innovation-based
policy approach

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.810
to a profound kind of
societal challenge.

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:40.120
So there's a whole
series of policy steps

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.570
that the report argues
need to be taken.

00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:47.320
We need to get across
NIH stovepipes.

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.980
NIH, which is all biology
all the time on most days,

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.440
needs to be encouraged to
be able to look at and fund

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.730
other fields.

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:56.410
It's hard for NIH to
do it because it's

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:58.120
composed of biologists.

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.180
If it analyzes proposals that
involve complex engineering,

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.580
how does it do the analysis?

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.190
How does it have
multidisciplinary peer review

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.590
systems?

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.380
Is it able to
encourage RO1s that

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.760
have multiple PIs, not
sole single PIs, that

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.320
represent a series of different
fields and disciplines.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.380
It's how do we do
education and convergence?

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:28.120
So we still have stove
piped disciplinary fields,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.890
and they're producing
a lot of talent.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:32.120
But how do they get educated
in these other fields

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.650
so they can take
advantage of it?

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:36.190
Do we need a new
kind of approach

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.630
in life science education?

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.550
And what are the of common
language features going to be?

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:41.050
Steph.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:43.000
AUDIENCE: I feel like
the report was really

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.180
missing an element about the
jobs in the convergence field,

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:49.170
because there's not really many
job opportunities for people

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.910
who are trained in
multidisciplinary

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:52.900
understandings.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.357
And I feel like there would
be an enormous insecurity

01:00:55.357 --> 01:00:57.940
or uncertainty for those people
who are interested in pursuing

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.148
the really innovative fields
if they don't understand

01:01:00.148 --> 01:01:02.617
what the actual next step is
after a university education.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:03.700
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.960
There's no question about it.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.860
This is a dilemma.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.840
And look, this has been
a dilemma for a while

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.760
for bioengineering departments.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.440
I think we're getting
out of that phase.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.780
I think those are starting
to really kind of take off,

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.140
in part because this
model is taking off.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.060
But we don't have
clear pathways.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.670
So I mean the model is going
to continue to be that you're

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:24.130
going to be a biologist.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:28.540
But can you get access to
a series of other fields?

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.940
Maybe you're an engineer but
you get significant access

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.430
to a series of medical
related fields as well.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:39.290
Can we adjust our training
system and modify it so that--

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.890
there was a talented staffer
in my office who said look,

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.750
we we're going to need
a new language here

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.525
in life science innovation.

01:01:45.525 --> 01:01:47.650
We're going to need kind
of our convergence Creole,

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:50.080
a mix of different languages
from different fields

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.090
so that people are going
to be able to speak

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.520
across these disciplinary
lines and understand things

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.620
across these disciplinary lines.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.980
That could be that could
be pretty important.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.740
You know that's the
heart of this report.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.730
MIT team subsequently went
on in a much broader based

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:08.830
report that went across
many institutions.

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:12.700
And this past year, did a
report looking at what could we

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.810
get from convergence?

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:16.240
In other words, what other
promising convergence areas

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.970
and what might be obtained
from them in an attempt

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.280
to get a much more strategic
approach to convergence?

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.890
Not just say
convergence is neat,

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:25.570
which is kind of
what this report did.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.230
But really get a
strategy together.

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.380
I'm partly guilty.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.660
But actually get a
strategy together

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.897
around what territories
in convergence

01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:35.230
might be particularly promising.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.240
So I urge you to take a look
at that more recent report.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.240
That was much more widely
shared across institutions.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.130
Luyao, some questions for us.

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.920
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
most relevant discussions

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.670
of the [INAUDIBLE] would be
what are the possible features

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:58.350
that we could expect in
university level that

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:00.960
will be probably encouraging
this kind of confidence

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.670
to take place?

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:04.170
Yes.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.085
AUDIENCE: I mean, we have the
whole liberal arts college.

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:08.460
It's essentially
the liberal arts

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.060
for science and
engineering model.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:17.380
AUDIENCE: But why is
it currently not--

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.450
like since they're
proposing this convergence

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:25.330
of researchers, so why
is it not happening

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:30.440
with all this students with
multidisciplinary backgrounds,

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.020
why are they not
currently working together

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.790
across disciplines?

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.120
AUDIENCE: I would say, in
no particular reference

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.760
to our institution at Wellesley.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.850
I work a lot with
multidisciplinary stakeholders

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:49.690
for the incubator program that
I am facilitating currently.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:53.770
And a big concern that
faculty members have

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:57.160
is that they, one,
by the administration

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.600
are not facilitated
to do collaborations.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.190
And two, that a
lot of people feel

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:09.400
like having an entrepreneurship
or a sort of innovation

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.220
for the purpose of
commercialization model

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.780
goes against the spirit of
a liberal arts education.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.460
So I feel like in
that sense, you know,

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:25.110
research universities are
very much well-designed

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.580
to sort of adopt more
of a liberal arts model

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.000
than I think liberal arts
colleges are designed

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.110
to adopt more of a stem model.

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.960
But you know, perhaps
somewhere in there

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:41.830
is a model that can arise about
multidisciplinary coordination.

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.260
But it would
require facilitation

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.270
by the administration
to the extent

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.010
to which I think
MIT does a really

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:53.850
great job of facilitating that
at the institutional level.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.850
AUDIENCE: The rise of kind
of these collaborative

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.340
projects, particularly
culminating

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.470
in your senior year, I
think capstone projects

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:04.950
are a great opportunity
to start encouraging

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.860
these collaborative efforts.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.910
I think Course Two
does this pretty well

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.290
with their 2.009
Mechancial Engineering

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.000
kind of product design course.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.150
But the piece that I
would take from that

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.650
is at the beginning
of the semester,

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.300
they have you list
all of your skills.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.630
And they separate you out
based on kind of backgrounds

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.510
and then form teams that are
like inherently collaborative,

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:30.240
so you don't have sort of
lumpiness and all the students

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.100
that are interested, or
have particular backgrounds

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.540
in product design, they're
not all on the same team.

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.490
They kind of spread it out.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:42.505
And then I think if it be
an interesting exercise

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:46.570
to have MIT do sort of a school
engineering capstone project.

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.240
And sort of elect
into a course where

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.690
you have people that
are interested in tissue

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:54.690
engineering, but they come
from the biology department,

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.640
the chemical
engineering department,

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.250
and bioengineering department,
and they work together

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:02.610
to kind of formalize this.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:04.990
AUDIENCE: In my impression,
there's kind of two models.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.650
Either we train more
multidisciplinary students

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:12.000
like, for me, like my major
is philosophy, politics,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.110
and economics.

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:16.200
But I'm not actually
in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.020
So then the other
option is to have

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.180
like a lot of very
focused students

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.170
and bring them together
to work as a team.

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.590
Which model do you think will
be more effective in addressing

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.938
health care change?

01:06:27.938 --> 01:06:29.480
AUDIENCE: I think
great groups model.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.593
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:30.593 --> 01:06:32.010
AUDIENCE: You
definitely like want

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:34.890
people that like, what's
the difference between--

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.480
AUDIENCE: It's the
deep generalist.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.700
That's what they
were calling them.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.242
AUDIENCE: No.

01:06:38.242 --> 01:06:39.990
Well, you need one
person who can gets it

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:41.310
for every single
one of the issues.

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.290
But then you need somebody
who-- you need somebody who is

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:43.860
obsessed--

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.025
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:06:45.025 --> 01:06:46.650
AUDIENCE: Yo, I read
every single book.

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.780
I read two, three books
outside this course.

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.480
You know, I know this
and this and this.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.260
And the person is
just like, like,

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.427
knows so much that like,
it's just like you hit them

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.370
with like, any word
and they're inspired.

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:58.658
So like, you want--

01:06:58.658 --> 01:07:01.200
but you definitely need somebody
who knows it and understands

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.010
how to lead really.

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:02.510
Well.

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:05.640
Because really great
engineers tend to not

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.227
be able to communicate greatly.

01:07:07.227 --> 01:07:09.060
So you have to be able
to figure out and ask

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.283
what questions to ask that they
won't tell you or figure out

01:07:12.283 --> 01:07:13.950
what they're not
telling you, especially

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.230
when hitting deadlines.

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:18.060
And then another big
part with groups,

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.190
with these kind of
groups, is to figure out

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.440
where each person stands.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.720
So it's like, oh, I don't
think you're doing a great job.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.460
Or I know you have
this deadline.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.580
You might may not make it.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.260
I know you're stressed.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.010
Don't be stressed.

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:31.483
I'll check in at the 70% mark.

01:07:31.483 --> 01:07:33.900
How are you doing and then
we'll figure it out from there.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.850
But I don't know,
I think is more

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.740
interesting to the
research and the media lab

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.670
kind of does that.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.087
But I don't know
if it's been done

01:07:40.087 --> 01:07:41.880
for very, very hard research.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.128
What I would consider
super, like solving

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:46.170
like a very hard problem.

01:07:49.448 --> 01:07:51.240
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
It's all these problems

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.920
are now at hand, as we
start to seriously pursue

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.020
this convergence model,
exactly how we're

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.317
going to cope with this.

01:07:59.317 --> 01:08:00.900
Susan Hockfield used
to talk about it.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.430
And other people have talked
about it too, T-shaped people.

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.520
In other words, people
with a deep disciplinary

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.060
die, but capable of operating
across fields as well.

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:13.470
And that may well be a
pretty key feature here.

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.210
And then combining
that community so

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.470
it's able to communicate
with each other.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.540
But you draw on a series
of different fields.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.569
So what the organizational
model is going to be

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:23.399
is really critical here.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.279
Because again as we've
talked about two classes ago,

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:28.845
innovation, you know,
happens with people.

01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:30.970
It's not these institutional
organizational models.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:33.137
And how do you optimize the
opportunities for people

01:08:33.137 --> 01:08:34.290
to be creative?

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:37.060
So that's upon
this model, right?

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.630
Koch Institute is spending a
lot of time thinking about this.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:42.540
But actually Koch
Institute is only one part

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.069
of the convergence
going on at MIT.

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:45.810
Something like 130
engineers are now

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:48.450
working a significant
amount of their time

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:52.010
at I'm MIT on the
life science side.

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:53.430
And that's not unique.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.970
That's going on at a
lot of institutions now.

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.710
And NIH is a problem here.

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.080
Because it hasn't
caught up to be

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.939
able to manage that
kind of transition

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.439
and embrace these
different fields.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.569
So that's the big funder.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:09.583
And how do we bring
that institution along?

01:09:09.583 --> 01:09:11.250
AUDIENCE: I think my
big concern though,

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.740
is like having all
academics, like, yeah, we're

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.569
getting T people
but, let's define

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:18.540
T like somebody who
is like a grad student

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.310
or undergrad at MIT.

01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:22.170
Like I don't know
if the best answer

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:24.720
is to have a great group of Ts.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.805
You know, I want some As.

01:09:25.805 --> 01:09:26.430
I want some Bs.

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:27.430
I want some accents.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.450
I want some question marks.

01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:33.450
Because like, I would use all
sorts, like the background,

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:33.950
right?

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:34.950
Because it is the
difference between,

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.640
oh, I can make a really good
like bistro sandwich versus I

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.710
need to make 100,
1,000, 100,000.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.359
And I need to have
the financials

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.700
for all of the stuff, which
is like McDonald's, right?

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:45.870
So ideally, I
would want somebody

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.600
who's already been in
the field, like somebody

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.725
who has faculty experience.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.090
Because I might start to
build out a certain way.

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.729
But they have just a big
scene phenomena, right?

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:55.810
Like a great example
is, originally

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:58.640
GE, when they were putting
out the electrical lens,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.110
there was this guy
named Steinmetz.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:04.230
He was this hunchback
immigrant that couldn't even

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:06.510
speak English when he
got to the country,

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:09.790
and didn't really have a great--
do you have Steinmetz on there?

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I don't.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.723
AUDIENCE: It would
be cool if you did.

01:10:11.723 --> 01:10:15.060
But, yeah, but he was just
like this very, very kind

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.402
of somebody who would
never even be at MIT.

01:10:18.402 --> 01:10:19.860
Or like the Wright
brothers, right?

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.690
That it was just they had
the practice experience

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:23.773
that, oh, I think I can
do this and trying it out.

01:10:23.773 --> 01:10:26.580
Also like just because
of, as in academics,

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.400
there's always a flaw
in any organization.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.940
And you have to figure out,
especially in business,

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.560
you look at, oh, how
can I expose their flaw

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.970
and they're never going
to be able to go here

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:33.762
because of the way.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.920
This is their blind spot.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.020
And so like, you can
definitely, like what

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.490
happened at the Wright
brothers, where it's like,

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:40.323
I can't work on this
problem because there's

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:42.360
no perfect theory and
it's too much of a risk.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.900
And I'm already 50 years old.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.303
And I'm not trying
to risk my reputation

01:10:47.303 --> 01:10:48.720
and make my friends
make fun of me

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.190
because that's
too uncomfortable.

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.720
And I've already kind
of like gone my way.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.880
And there might be somebody
that's like, you know,

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.380
it's pretty crazy
but I'm just going

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.060
to try it and see what happens.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.980
And I think in that paper, there
is a quote, where it's like,

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.772
what's the point of
research if you already

01:11:00.772 --> 01:11:02.030
know what's going to happen?

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.680
But the way the
system is, sometimes

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.270
it incentivizes you
to just do like,

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.590
oh, I know this is
never going to--

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:07.800
I don't know if it's
going to be perfect.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.717
But I know it's pretty
much going to work out.

01:11:09.717 --> 01:11:10.880
And I think that's a very--

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.213
OK, as like somebody
who likes capitalism,

01:11:13.213 --> 01:11:14.630
I think that's a
huge opportunity.

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:16.755
Because like, you don't
just make your company look

01:11:16.755 --> 01:11:17.760
at all the blind spots.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.120
But I think that's going
to be one of the reasons

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.280
why these models don't succeed.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.430
And it will be big failure too.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:26.360
If they fail, right?

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.380
Because of you like you said.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.422
You spent all this money.

01:11:28.422 --> 01:11:29.950
You got all these smart people.

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.642
And there can be a
huge failure there.

01:11:31.642 --> 01:11:33.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So let's close.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.450
I attempted to put the
convergence reading last

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.630
because it's
basically a positive.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.400
In other words, there are
huge innovation opportunities

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.610
that are at hand that
we're starting to move on.

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:46.400
So despite all the problems
in the innovation system

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.490
in this sector and all of
its organizational gaps,

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.810
something really interesting
is starting to happen.

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.320
So let me close with a comment
from Elias Zerhouni, who

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.210
is the Director of NIH
before Francis Collins.

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:02.060
He writes, "As science
grows more complex,

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.690
it is also converging on a
set of unifying principles

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:08.450
that link apparently
disparate diseases

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.060
through common
biological pathways

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.830
and therapeutic approaches.

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:17.240
Today NIH research needs to
reflect this new reality."

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.930
So I think that's our innovation
organization task here,

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.830
I think summarized nicely
in a couple of sentences

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.170
from Zerhouni.

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:29.140
A closing thought, Luyao?

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.840
AUDIENCE: Well, I do think this
reading sends a very positive

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.350
message that we
will need to search

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:40.930
for a holistic organization
that kind of get our resources

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:42.490
and tackle these problems.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.190
Still, I also feel
like we are not

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:48.190
addressing the
problem of kind of,

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:52.450
instead of tackling all these
diseases, why don't we prepare,

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:55.090
like kind of advocate
this population to be

01:12:55.090 --> 01:13:00.832
more healthy, to encourage them
to have a healthier lifestyle.

01:13:00.832 --> 01:13:03.040
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Preventative
medicine rather than

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.760
just repair jobs.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.345
Right, right.

01:13:05.345 --> 01:13:06.220
An important thought.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.260
AUDIENCE: And I do think--

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
there aren't incentives

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.150
in this system particularly

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:12.600
which is problematic.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.270
PROFESSOR: Anyway,
welcome today.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.720
Stefan Andreev is our guest
speaker from Morgan Stanley.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.655
And as I understand
you have a degree,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.952
a PhD Degree in
chemical physics.

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:33.660
STEFAN ANDREEV: In
chemical physics, yes.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.697
And maybe I should go here.

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:38.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.063
PROFESSOR: And now he's
in the world of finance.

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:44.310
And we're here to benefit
from your experience.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.880
STEFAN ANDREEV: Thank you very
much for the introduction.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.400
Yeah.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.650
I went to school at
Dartmouth College undergrad,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.970
and then up the street
at Harvard for my PhD.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.260
And then I transitioned
from science to finance.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.676
And for the last
eight years, I've

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:03.590
been working at Morgan Stanley,
working with Vasily Strela,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.310
an instructor in the course.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.850
So today, what are we
going to be talking about?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.370
Well, to give you a big-picture
view of where our topic fits

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.420
within the grand scheme
of finance-- in general,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.860
there are really two
big areas in my view.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.130
Well, there's probably
more, but these

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.690
are kind of most famous,
I would say, areas

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.390
where quantitative
skills can be--

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.740
are very valuable in finance.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.820
And the two areas are--
one area is statistics,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.660
predictions, which
is essentially,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.630
say given some historical
behavior in the market,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.910
how do we predict what
will happen in the future?

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.620
And that's certainly
a huge industry.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.640
People have made a ton of money
applying quantitative concepts

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.950
to that.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.760
But that's not what we're
going to talk about today.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.540
What we're going to talk
about is another very big area

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.990
called pricing, which
is pricing and hedging

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.600
of complex instruments.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.350
And that area is really
about essentially

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.430
when you have a complex
product that you don't really

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.410
know the price of, but you know
the prices of other products.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710
And then you can use
the other products

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.290
to essentially replicate the
payoff of your complex product.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.660
Then you can use
mathematical techniques

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.260
to essentially say, look,
the main statement is hey,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.780
because I can
replicate my payoff,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.850
and using products that
I know the price of,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.640
then that means that
I can say something

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.890
about the price of
my complex product.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.860
I can basically price it.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.830
And not only can
I price it, but I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.710
can also-- when I
give the price, I

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.770
know that I can eliminate
any uncertainty from owning

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.510
the product by executing
a hedging replication

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.465
strategy-- at least
theoretically speaking.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.200
So that's the area we're
going to focus today.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.600
And our main focus is going to
be on FX-- foreign exchange--

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.880
interest rates, and
credit-- and in particular

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.920
about credit-FX hybrid models.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.420
We're going to be talking
about essentially what

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.350
happens, why do we need
credit-FX hybrid models,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.530
and going through an
example of a simple one,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.629
and how to apply it.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.170
In particular-- and there's the
mathematical techniques we're

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.489
going to be using--
as I said, we

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.030
are going to be talking about
the risk-neutral pricing, which

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.220
is essentially replication.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.350
And we're going to talk about
how to use jump processes--

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.100
which you might have seen in
other parts of your studies

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.872
as Poisson processes-- to
describe certain behaviors

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:05.880
of price behavior that you
cannot really describe very

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.990
easily using pure diffusion
Brownian motions that you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.250
probably have seen
so far in the course.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.624
And why do we care about that?

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:16.540
Well, there are certain
financial applications

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540
where this is important.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.300
And in particular,
something that

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.150
happened in the last few years--
the sovereign crisis in Europe.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.259
And also, it has happen
not just last year.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.550
This happened many times in
other parts of the emerging

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.170
markets.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.570
And given the emerging
markets as my background,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.210
I've worked on these
kind of models.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.550
And this is, when you
have Greek bonds in Euros,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.940
and there's a potential for
Greek default. And as we know,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.530
as you might have
read in the news,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.380
there was really a
big worry about what

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.410
will happen to the Euro
currency if there is

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.300
a spate of sovereign defaults.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.514
And in fact, Euro currency
did-- in anticipation

00:04:56.514 --> 00:04:58.305
of the possibility of
default-- it actually

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:05.170
did depreciate for while
back in 2011 and 2012.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.710
Now it's pretty much back
where it was before that,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.430
but it certainly--
there was a fear

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.730
in the market-- which was also
very, very obvious in terms

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.370
of option prices-- that Euro
currency could depreciate

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.950
significantly if, in fact, a
disorderly default did happen.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.790
Now it didn't happen,
so that's good.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.510
But in other emerging
markets in history,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.650
it has happened before.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.980
So it's not really
an empty question.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.090
So foreign exchange-- how do
we describe it in math finance?

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.480
Well, we think of
it as the price

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.570
of a unit of foreign
currency in dollars.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.870
In our presentation we're
going to denote the spot FX

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.830
rate, which is the current
rate of exchange, by S.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.020
And here is a sample graph
of euro-USD FX rates.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.740
You can see it looks
like a random walk.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.300
It's very well described
in normal circumstances

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.000
as random walk.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.280
So one very fundamental property
that connects FX and interest

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.880
rates is the so-called
FX forwards interest rate

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.700
parity, which says if I have
a certain amount of money--

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:27.710
in this example, $5 million,
and I can invest it,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.200
there's two ways I can
utilize this money.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.360
One way is to just
invest it at a dollar

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.620
kind of risk-free rate.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.700
And we're assuming here
we have a risk-free rate--

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.150
the standard assumption.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.460
Or we can do something
like we can take the money,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.112
exchange it into,
say, euros, invest

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.620
it using the euro
risk-free rate,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.720
and then exchange it
back into dollars.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.640
And this is essentially used
to price FX forward contracts.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.890
So FX forward contracts
are a contract

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.410
that allow you to say, look,
I'm going to agree with you,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.850
then in one month's time,
I'm going to, say, give you

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.110
4,108,405 euros, and you're
going to give me back

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.960
$5,170,000.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.839
It's essentially an agreement;
it's a derivative contract.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.130
And if you see the-- if you
have this forward contract,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.070
you can lock in, essentially,
through conversion in euros.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.670
So you can lock in an
effective dollar interest rate.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.060
So FX forwards can be
essentially described fully

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.700
by knowing the interest rates
in each currency and the spot FX

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.160
rate.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.220
Conversely, you can infer
foreign interest rates

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.790
knowing the FX forwards.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.780
They're very connected.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.620
Yes?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.070
AUDIENCE: In this example,
there's no mispricing,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.236
so you get that same amount.

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:52.257
Is that the idea?

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:54.590
STEFAN ANDREEV: In this
example, there is no mispricing.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.230
You get back the same amount.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.790
So we are assuming, essentially,
there's no arbitrage.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.680
We're not assuming,
but we're given--

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.880
if the prices were, indeed,
if this interest rate-- 4.6%

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.090
in Euros-- interest rate was
4.6, in dollars it's 3.4.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.200
And here are the current spots,
which is 127 and the forward,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.790
125-- if these were, in
fact, the observable mark

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.460
quantities in the market, then
there would be no arbitrage.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.640
And there is-- you're basically
indifferent whether you invest

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.390
the money in dollars,
or you go the way

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.980
of exchanging into Euros, and
investing in Euros, and then

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.190
back into dollars.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.380
So in this example, the way
I've presented, worked it out,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.309
there is no arbitrage.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.892
Now, if some of these numbers--
say the interest rate in Euros

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.120
were 4% instead of 4.6, and
all the other quantities were

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.750
the same, then, in fact,
there would be arbitrage.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.990
And you could make
money by borrowing money

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.915
in dollars and investing.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.040
I mean, the purpose
of this slide

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.160
is really to
illustrate kind of hey,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.440
if there's no arbitrage,
how one would actually

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.280
compare-- how one
would actually look

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.140
for arbitrage in this example.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.670
This is-- again, this is
a little bit of definition

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.505
what are compound
interest, interest rates.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.366
We're going to talk about
instantaneous risk-free rates.

00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:21.240
We're going to, again,
say they're risk-free.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.544
So basically, we
know for sure we're

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:24.710
going to get our money back.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.340
You can think of
risk-free rates as the one

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.170
that treasuries pay in
real life, or the one

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.490
that Federal Reserve
guarantees on deposits.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.190
There's various examples
of risk-free rates.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.522
And while, in practice,
different risk-free rates

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:41.980
can actually be different, so
they're not really risk-free.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.482
But in our world right
now, in our model,

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:46.940
we're going to
assume that there is

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.050
such a thing as a risk-free
rate for every currency,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.770
and it's unique.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:59.270
And now, as we talk about our
dynamics of the FX process,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.310
what's really focused
on here is an FX--

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.380
we're making an FX model.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.870
And we want to see-- in
the previous example,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.525
we saw if you're given a FX rate
and given some interest rates,

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:10.900
here's what the
FX forward really

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.270
has to be in order
to have no arbitrage.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.390
Well, now we are
trying to describe.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.905
We tried to describe or define
a process for the FX currency.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.290
Essentially, this kind
of no-arbitrage condition

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:33.060
leads to having
certain constraints

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.470
on what the stochastic
differential

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.870
equation has to be.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.600
So in this particular
case, the constraint

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.810
is that the drifts
of the process

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.320
has to be the differential
in interest rates.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.917
So if one currency pays more
than the other currency,

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:51.250
obviously, people would want
to invest in that currency.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.070
So that in order for
no arbitrage to exist,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.930
there has to be an expectation
that the currency that

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.830
pays more would depreciate
in the future, otherwise

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.000
it would be an arbitrage.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.080
So if it doesn't depreciate,
if you can kind of say,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.740
hey, this currency
won't depreciate,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.080
then you can just always
invest in that currency that

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.330
pays higher interest rates and
make money-- which, in fact,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.610
many people do.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.360
But again, that's a-- they're
taking a certain risk.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.290
They're taking the risk that
the currency will depreciate.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.700
So what do we actually want?

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.460
What we want is to say--
we want to essentially--

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.500
and for the arbitrage
conditions from before-- which

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.870
is to say that my forward rate
has to be essentially the spot

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:46.660
rate-- well, this
condition here has

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.750
to be observed, essentially.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.780
And what does that mean?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.264
It means that my forward
rate has to be my spot--

00:11:54.264 --> 00:11:56.055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
each other, you mean?

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:56.530
STEFAN ANDREEV:
What did you say?

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] set
those equal to each other?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.960
STEFAN ANDREEV: Yes.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.900
My forward rate has to equal
to the spot rate times,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.251
essentially, the interest
rate differential.

00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:16.460
If that is true, than
in the previous set up,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.980
there will be no arbitrage.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.670
And why is that?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.000
Well, that's because
the amount of money

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.825
I earn on the domestic
leg is e to the rd.

00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:31.730
The amount of money I earn on
the foreign leg is e to the rf,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.030
but then I multiply
by the forward,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.490
and that has to equal
to the e to the rd.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.890
So this is a standard.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:49.040
This is a the most
basic dynamic FX model

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.180
that people use in industry.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.930
It's referred to as the
Black-Scholes FX model.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.360
And the stock price-- you've
seen stochastic models before.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.630
Usually, you see the stock price
when people talk about options.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.470
In that case, this drift is just
the risk-free interest rate.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.710
Well, here in FX, it's a
differential of interest rates.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.010
Otherwise, it's very similar.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.070
So FX has some
interesting properties.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.840
So we're gonna talk
about the game.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.120
Before we go to the
game, one question:

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.360
can FX exchange rate
ever be negative?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.369
What do you guys think?

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:38.285
Can the dollar-euro
exchange rate be negative?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.980
Any ideas?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.440
No, it's hard, because
what does negative mean?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.970
It means I have to pay you
money to give you euros.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.251
Why would you?

00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.000
You have to pay me
money to give me euros.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.070
Nobody would do that.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.430
It can be 0, potentially,
if dollars are worthless

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.740
or something, but it
cannot really be negative.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:13.150
So that's one reason why
I wrote my SDE as a kind

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.270
of a log-normal process.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.010
You recognize this by
the form dS over S.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.480
So the changes in the FX are
proportional to the value

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.990
of the FX.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.350
So the process can
never become negative.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.710
OK, so it can never
become negative,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.010
but how big can it get?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.170
And the answer is,
it can get very big.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.360
I mean, we have currencies,
notably some currency

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.962
like Zimbabwean dollars,
that traded-- I don't know,

00:14:41.962 --> 00:14:44.420
I mean, I actually don't know
what Zimbabwean dollars trade

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.170
at, but I think it's
somewhere in the billions

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.421
of Zimbabwean dollars
per dollar, so something.

00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:51.670
It's a really extreme example.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.400
It can really get extremely big.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.670
So there is now
really upper bound,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.910
while there is a lower bound.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.610
So the distribution, as
you can imagine has a skew.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.260
It's not symmetric
around the average.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.650
It's limited on the lower side.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.490
It can go very high
on the high side.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.405
And log-normal distribution
has that property.

00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:14.280
Have you guys seen a
log-normal distribution?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.490
You've talked about this stuff
in the course before, right?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.020
So let's go back to our game.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.120
So our game is, we
have assumptions.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.890
My assumptions are
not to be realistic,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.280
but to make it simple.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.690
Let's assume that our dollars
and euros exchange rate is one,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.050
so we can exchange
one Euro for $1.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.840
Clearly not exactly the case,
but let's make that assumption.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.120
And we also assume
that the FX forwards

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.100
is 1, which basically
means that the interest

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.400
rates in both
currencies are the same.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.655
And now let's say
I'm going to make you

00:15:54.655 --> 00:16:01.715
a bet that-- now dollars and
euros is a volatile process.

00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:03.340
Right now, it's one,
but in the future,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.890
it could be different from
one-- could be higher or lower.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:10.950
So if dollar-euro FX process
is more than one in one month,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.520
then you give me money.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.060
And then if it's less
than one in one month,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.960
then I give you money.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.345
And we're going to have
two payoffs, so two games.

00:16:23.855 --> 00:16:25.230
I don't know why
it says "bet B."

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.100
Should say just "bet."

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.017
I'm sorry about that.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.230
That in the payoff
A, basically you're

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.890
going to give me $100
if I win, and I'm going

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.990
to give you $100 if you win.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.040
And in payoff B, you're going
to give me 100 euros if I win,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.420
and I'll give you
100 euros if you win.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.410
And the question is, which
game would you prefer to play,

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.420
or do you not care?

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.140
So in each case, you kind
of win, lose same number.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.130
So I want to see hands.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.609
Who wants to play game A?

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.329
Come on guys, wake up.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.300
Who wants to play game A?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.159
I mean if you don't
know, you just--

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:19.450
lets say you like Euros better.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.740
You can say this is not
really graded, so it's OK.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.740
OK, nobody really
knows what to play?

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.002
Like how about game B?

00:17:29.002 --> 00:17:30.210
Anybody wants to play game B?

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.790
OK, you guys want to play?

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:37.930
Three people for game--
four-- game A nobody still?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.500
Same person for game A and B?

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.910
All right.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.730
OK, two people-- so now--

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.170
AUDIENCE: Behavioral
science says

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.360
people are reluctant to
lose-- more reluctant to lose.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.620
STEFAN ANDREEV: That's
true, that is true.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.580
However, so people
are reluctant to lose.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.000
And I said, look, the FX
forward in one month is 1.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.890
So you can actually-- that's the
market price that in one month,

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.760
FX forward is 1.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.470
And this-- our bet--
kind of the strike is 1.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.884
So our bet level is 1.

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:08.300
So you can kind
of say, well, this

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.460
looks like kind of fair game.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.090
So I don't expect
to win or lose much,

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.406
but I'm just reluctant to do it.

00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:16.530
And I can get that feeling.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.840
That's the risk
aversion aspect of it.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.730
But if you were
forced to make a bet,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.950
question is, which
one would you prefer?

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.180
So I understand you
might not want to play.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.119
But I'll say, OK,
so you guys don't

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:34.410
seem to be in the mood to play.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.033
That's fine.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.080
Let's look at some scenarios.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.370
So let's say in one month,
dollar-euro goes to 1.25.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.810
In bet A, I lose $100.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.200
In bet B, I lose 100 euros.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.700
So bet A-- actually,
you lose 100 euros,

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.260
not-- so bet A for you, you
are $25 better than bet B.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.210
And in the second case,
if dollar-euro is 0.75,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:14.830
you make $100, or you make 100
euros in bet B. In that case,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.610
you also-- bet A is $25 better.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.180
So it doesn't
matter what happens.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.600
Bet A seems to be
the better case.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.595
So if you're, like, our dear
professor here, then you

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:32.220
don't like to lose,
then you probably

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.455
are going to choose
bet A, I assume, right?

00:19:34.455 --> 00:19:35.330
That's a better deal.

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:39.200
And that's kind of
strange, though.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.370
I mean, like both
payouts were symmetric--

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.250
so it's 100 euros,
100 euros, $100, $100.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.100
Why is it one is
better than the other?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:55.640
Well it's like
what really happens

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.880
is the units of the bet--
the value of those units

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.020
depend on whether
you win or lose.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.050
So it's not like if I
was betting using acorns,

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.760
then you get two acorns
or I get two acorns,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.430
then actually, it
might be a fair bet.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.060
But because I'm betting in
euros and dollars, and the value

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.010
of these things-- the
relative value changes based

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.920
on the actual whether
you win or lose,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.960
then the game is not
symmetric any more.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.280
So the reason I wanted to
take you through this game

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.980
is because there are a
lot of cases in finance

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.610
where people make bets.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.270
But then the value
of what you get

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.830
depends on whether
you win or you lose.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:47.720
And that has an effect
on the value of the bet.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.430
And in particular, the case
we're going to talk about today

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.770
is one of these cases,
which is the credit FX.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.045
That's why we need to
credit-FX quanto models.

00:20:58.045 --> 00:21:01.250
To give you an
illustration from finance,

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.510
let's take Italy bonds.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.639
So Italy issues bonds both
in dollars and in euros.

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:08.180
Why does it issue
in both currencies?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.460
Because Italy has to
issue a lot of bonds.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.270
And they need to find as
many investors as they can.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.220
And some investors
want to buy euro bonds,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.053
and some investors want
to buy dollar bonds.

00:21:19.053 --> 00:21:22.330
And they want to access
both bases of investors.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.810
Now, these bonds
they cross-default,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.900
meaning if Italy defaults on
one bond, all of its bonds

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.880
default together, including
the euros and the dollar bonds.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:42.050
So then there is a
notion of credit spread,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.520
which is the measure
of how risky Italy is.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.260
So you can take
euro bonds, and you

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.760
can say, well, how
much premium does

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.145
Italy pay over German bonds?

00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:52.020
Let's assume that German
bonds are risk-free,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.370
which is the standard
assumption for euros,

00:21:54.370 --> 00:22:00.270
that the German bonds--
Germany is the main underlying

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.070
economic force for the Euro.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.770
They're kind of risk-free bonds.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.600
And Italy pays a certain
spread over euros.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.160
Same thing for dollars-- it
pays a certain spread over USA.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.650
So if Italy wants
to borrow money,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.220
they have to pay a
higher interest rate,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.553
just like if you want to
borrow money for student loans,

00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:21.350
you have to pay higher
interest rate than the Fed.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.730
And the size of that
spread is in the market.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:29.240
It determines how risky
of a borrower you are.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.450
Well, it turns out that
these spreads are not

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.130
the same in both currencies.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.981
One currency has a higher
spread than other currencies.

00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:39.480
That's kind of an
interesting thing.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.510
So there is two
questions really:

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.310
when the spreads
are not the same,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.880
which currency would Italy
prefer to issue bonds in?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.047
And which currency do investors
prefer to buy bonds in?

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.170
So this is kind of similar to
the previous game we played,

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:03.330
because if you're an investor
trying to buy bonds, well,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.950
if Italy defaults,
then chances are

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.830
the euro is not doing so well.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.030
So you would lose money.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.100
And if you have euro bonds,
you would lose euros.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.940
If you have dollar
bonds, you lose dollars.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.430
On the other hand, if Italy does
not default and pays you back,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.890
then chances are, euros
are not doing that bad.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.910
So you would actually be
making euros and dollars.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.810
So it's an
interesting-- it's kind

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.090
of a similar dynamic going on.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.910
So there's the same
kind of question

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.450
that I asked before-- USD,
euros, are equal in both.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.880
So what do you think now?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.120
Now that we've gone
through an example, maybe

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.890
we'll have a higher
participation in my pop quiz.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:54.290
Who thinks that USD bonds
have a higher credit spread,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:24:02.830
and who thinks-- so A.
Vote for A. One, two.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.180
So who thinks that euro bonds
will have a higher credit

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.880
spread?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:14.850
OK, one, all right--
so two to one.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.240
I think the two to one wins.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:23.237
All right, I must say, you
guys seem that-- maybe it's

00:24:23.237 --> 00:24:24.445
the format of the auditorium.

00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:26.460
People don't like to raise
their hands too much,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.744
or maybe they're afraid
that they're being filmed.

00:24:28.744 --> 00:24:30.106
[LAUGHS]

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.710
OK.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:40.760
Well, how are we
going to do this?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.332
How are we going to
answer this question?

00:24:43.332 --> 00:24:44.790
Before I give you
the answer, we're

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.956
going to go through a slide.

00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:49.430
Well, first we're going to say,
well, FX rates are volatile.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.600
There is volatility,
as we said before.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.260
So now we're going to-- in order
to compare euro bonds to dollar

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.440
bonds, we need to really
come up with a strategy

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.080
to replicate one with the other,
and then look at the price--

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.700
look at how much do we need to
buy one to replicate the other.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.020
If we're able to come up with
such a replication strategy,

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.640
then we can
immediately say, hey,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:20.160
if you need 150 euro bonds to
replicate 100 dollar bonds,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.330
then that means that the euro
bonds have to be cheaper.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.740
That's basically the
replication argument.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.320
So you can try to do that
by piecing together bonds,

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.847
or we can use the powerful
tools of mathematical finance

00:25:33.847 --> 00:25:35.430
that you've been
learning about, which

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.010
is all about
replication and pricing.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.910
And the three steps
are: we're going

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.210
to analyze the payoffs
of the instruments,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.000
and we're going to
write some model,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.440
a model for FX and
for credit, and we're

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.047
going to price those bonds.

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.880
And then we're going
to look at the results,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.220
and try to understand
the problem intuitively.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.040
And that's basically
what we do, pretty much.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.260
That's what option quants do
on Wall Street all the time.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.510
So here's the answer:
dollar versus euro

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.410
spreads from the marketplace.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.730
So usually what happens in these
kind of questions in finances,

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.920
you kind of have an
answer, and then you

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.330
try to compute a model that
explains the difference.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.190
So that's what we're
going to do now.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:27.720
Well, the USD spreads are
actually lower-- USD bond

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.980
spreads are actually lower.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:47.170
Now, so there is
really-- when we're

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.790
talking about bonds, risky
bonds, there's two states.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:57.130
They are either performing,
or they are non-performing

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.300
and in default. And
we're going to go here

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.440
through an example of two bonds.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.514
And we're going to use two
zero-coupon bonds, which

00:27:09.514 --> 00:27:10.805
essentially have zero recovery.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:19.150
And the idea there is really
to make the question simple

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.490
so we can analyze it better.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.330
But you don't lose
a lot of generality

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.800
by saying zero-coupon
versus coupon.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.880
It's not-- the
answer, the intuition

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.770
would be exactly the same.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:32.980
So let's say we have
two zero-coupon bonds,

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.640
same maturity, they
pay 100 on maturity.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.420
And by the way, bonds-- I don't
know how much you guys have-- I

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.240
say these things.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.540
I'm very familiar with them.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.956
Bonds are nothing
more than loans.

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:47.460
So zero-coupon bond means I
give you some amount of money,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:54.220
and at some pre-agreed maturity,
you're going to pay me 100.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.880
So let's say I give you 80
cents, one year from now,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880
you pay me 100.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.900
And I call this a
zero-coupon bond,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.090
because you don't pay me
any intervening coupons.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.260
There's no interest
payments, but just I

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.080
pay you less money now, and
you pay me more at maturity.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.380
OK, so we know that
bond U pays $100.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.420
Bond E pays 100 euros.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.380
And let's say we denote the
prices-- price of U is Pu,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.490
price of E is Pu.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.370
Our spot FX rate, we're
are going to call it St;

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.960
our FX forward, Ft.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.070
Now we're going to have kind
of a simple arbitrage strategy.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:42.620
Well, let's say if we can
sell 100 times Ft dollar bonds

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:48.630
and with the proceeds,
buy 100-- we're

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.160
going to get-- if we
sell 1,000 dollar bonds,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.210
we're going to get
this much proceeds.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.610
There's the price.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:04.860
And if we buy 1,000
euro bonds-- so we

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.780
can enter into an
FX forward contract

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:14.060
for 100,000 euros for
maturity T at zero cost.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.380
All right, so let's see how
this strategy actually pays out.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:32.230
Well, what happens is you--
there's 100,000 euros.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.480
You get 100,000 euros for
selling the euro bonds.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.300
You pay 100,000 times Ft
dollars, say dollar bonds.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.950
There is an FX forward
contract, and at maturity, you

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:50.222
can exchange this $100,000 for
100,000 euros using this FX

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:50.930
forward contract.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.900
You already agreed to do that.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.530
So your FX forward
actually exactly

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.600
hedges-- you can basically use
the proceeds of these bonds

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.850
to-- you can
exchange the proceeds

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.450
at zero cost at maturity,
because you have entered

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.470
into the FX forward contract.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.660
So your net payoff is 0.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.500
So that means that the
prices of these bonds

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.070
have to be the same.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.840
But what if they're not?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.110
What if Ft, which
is in this case

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.120
is 1, forward contract--
what if the price in dollars

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.020
is different from exchange
rate times the price in euros?

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.800
Well, in that case, you can say,
well, there is an arbitrage.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.170
And you'll be
right, if you would

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:41.030
be able to make money if, in
fact, the bonds performed.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.780
But what happens if
there is a default?

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:51.139
If there's default, that
wouldn't really necessarily be

00:30:51.139 --> 00:30:52.680
the case, because
if there's default,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.513
these bonds don't pay
anything, and you just

00:30:54.513 --> 00:30:56.559
have an FX forward contract.

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:58.100
And this FX forward
contract is going

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.330
to be worth something
after default,

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.440
especially if the
FX rate depends,

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:10.099
like jumps, upon default.
So arbitrage, again,

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.390
is-- so you start with 0 money.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.620
You make money if there's
nonzero probability.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:20.490
And let's say in
this particular case,

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.030
the strategy-- payoff in case of
default with 25% recovery rate

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.760
is-- you actually
have only-- 25%

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.440
means you only have a quarter
of the payoff now at maturity,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.580
if default occurs.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.960
But you have a hedge
for the full 100,000.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.430
Your FX forward is
for full 100,000.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.560
So for 25,000 of it, you
can use the FX forward

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.760
to exchange money.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.390
For the remaining
75,000 you just

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.210
have an FX forward outright.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.270
So if FX moved against
you, you would lose money.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.495
So that's why the strategy is
not necessarily an arbitrage.

00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:55.870
And that's why the two prices
of the dollar and euro bond

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.480
are not necessarily
related to each other.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.240
They don't have to be equal,
because, in fact, there

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.520
is a possibility of default.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.070
And you cannot really
directly hedge.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.290
You cannot really construct an
arbitrage strategy by using FX

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.190
forwards and the bonds
together so easily.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.690
You have to take into account
what happens if default occurs.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.000
OK, so give an example.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.850
What happens upon FX
when default occurs?

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.970
Well, one of the
most recent defaults

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.840
of a country-- of a big country
that has its own currency--

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.800
is Argentina, 2001.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:44.400
And when it defaulted, the
Argentinian peso skyrocketed.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.180
Here is the graph
of the price series.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:54.790
So if you had an FX forward
contract that essentially--

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.170
if you had a position where
you were left with a naked FX

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.860
forward contract, where you
were receiving pesos and paying

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.640
dollars in the event
of default, you

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.350
would have lost a lot of money
when the default happened.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.200
It would have really
gone against you.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.460
And this is, by the way,
this is a massive move.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.080
And the Argentinian
peso still is not

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:18.480
recovered from that default.
So can we do better?

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.720
What do we actually--
what should we be

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.040
doing when we're hedging this?

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.210
And the answer
is, again, we have

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:30.120
to apply mathematical models
to really try to come up

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.500
with a replication strategy.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.237
So what is the main
features of a model

00:33:34.237 --> 00:33:35.320
that will help me do this?

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.650
Well, first I need to model
a credit default, the credit

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.970
default event.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.980
I need to have this in my model.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.940
And I need to have
something which

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.840
says FX has to
move upon default.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.990
And then we're going to
construct a complete market.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.140
Then we're going to define some
simple dynamics on our exchange

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.240
rate and on our
defaults, and we're

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.980
going to try to price for bonds.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.055
So how do we do that?

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:15.830
Well, what we--
generally, again,

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.409
how we're going
to use the models,

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:23.250
we're going to define an SDE,
like I just defined initially

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.210
a dS over S of something.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.139
And I'm going to solve this
SDE either analytically

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.480
or numerically.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.730
And what's important,
the way we actually

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.290
use these models
in trading, we're

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.110
going to look at how the
price of each instrument

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.280
depends on the
hedging instrument.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.090
And that is going to
define my hedge ratio

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.239
or my replicating strategy.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.719
That's really kind
of the main part.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.130
It's really hedging and
evaluation and pricing

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.510
are the same-- right
and left hands.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.260
We're really talking
about the same thing.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.344
You cannot really
price without hedging.

00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:56.469
And pricing without hedging
is kind of meaningless,

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.750
in some sense.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.280
Pricing represents the
price of a hedging strategy.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:08.040
OK, how do we-- basic credit
model, how do we model default?

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.690
Well the standard model
in finance for default

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.520
is to define the default events.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.150
And we say well,
this default event

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.140
arrives as a discrete event.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.860
And it arrives at the time
tau, which is a random time.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.230
And we're going to
model the tau, the time,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.310
as a Poisson process, which
means that we don't know when

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.300
it's going to come,
but we know something

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.930
about the probabilities
of when it's coming.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.900
And the Poisson process
has an intensity.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.450
The intensity in this case is h.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.310
And basically, the
meaning of intensity

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:49.980
means the probability of the
default time not the arriving

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:56.480
by time capital T is e to
the minus h times capital

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.950
T minus little t.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.860
Little t means now.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.550
Let's say we're
saying at time t,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.477
we know the default
has not arrived.

00:36:03.477 --> 00:36:05.310
Here is the probability
the default will not

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.426
arrive by some time t later.

00:36:08.426 --> 00:36:10.800
So in our model, we're going
to make a simple assumption.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.320
Let's say constant
hazard rate, and we can,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.420
since we know the probability
of the default time not arriving

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.020
after a certain time capital
T-- that's like a cumulative

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.990
distribution--

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.350
we can also find the
probability density the default

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:30.060
time happens at
some time capital T,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:35.940
or around some time
epsilon around capital T.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.950
It's just the derivative of
the cumulative distribution.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.320
And corollary is that
the probability density

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.340
of the default at
any given time is

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:53.190
h, which is essentially the
limit of capital T going

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.910
to little t.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:01.670
So now in our model,
what happens to FX rate?

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:06.010
Well FX rate is going to be
denoted by S. And FX rate right

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:11.070
after default would be equal
to FX rate before default times

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:15.600
e to the power J.
And J essentially

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.650
is our kind of
percent devaluation,

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.070
you can think of it.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.430
So it's kind of like
a percent devaluation.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.830
So J can go from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.300
If J is 0, then that means
is there's no devaluation.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:38.980
So you can see the log of
St basically jumps by J.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.660
So in a log-normal process,
the log of St is normal,

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.660
and essentially,
it's just a shift

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.080
of the normal distribution.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.550
OK, so how do we describe this?

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.680
We define a jump from default
Poisson process with intensity

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.590
h, as on the board.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:04.370
And our FX dynamics-- and
I apologize for the small

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:13.880
script-- is that our d log of S
will have some drift, mu_t dt,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.712
and then a jump process J*dN.

00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:20.170
So this is slightly different
from what you've seen so far.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.440
So far you've seen
Brownian motions.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.530
This is J*dN.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.730
This is now a jump process.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:35.060
Now what we want,
again, we want still

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.850
our standard no-arbitrage
condition to remain constant.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.260
And from before,
we had a condition

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:49.380
that expected value of S
of T has to be S of 0 times

00:38:49.380 --> 00:39:04.880
e to the rf minus rd times T. So
that still has to be the case.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.220
And in our case,
we're going to assume

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:15.700
that rf and rd are both 0.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.954
So in our case, we're
going to ask-- basically

00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:21.870
zero interest rate
environment to make, again,

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.330
the model simple.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:27.590
Then we just want the expected
value of S_T to be S_0.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.302
So how do we achieve that?

00:39:29.302 --> 00:39:30.760
Well, we need to
show, essentially,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:36.850
that this mu, the drift, has
to equal to this expression

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.060
here, h times 1 e
to the J. That's

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.380
known as the compensator term.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.630
And you can think-- you can
imagine this as a formula.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.610
Like, if I have a
Poisson process that

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.390
has a possibility
of jumping up, then

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.800
in order for that
Poisson process

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.600
to be on average to be
equal to the initial value,

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.720
it has to be kind of trending
down most of the time.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.830
And then, so that when the
possibility of jump is there,

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.710
the average of the two can be 0.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:10.260
So that's known as a compensator
term of the Poisson process.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:14.450
OK, so we can go
through and derive

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:18.830
how do we get--
what we want to do

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:24.260
is, we're going to check that
this form actually does indeed

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.980
give you that expectation,
does satisfy the condition

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.970
for the expectation.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:39.030
OK, so again, we start
with dS_t is mu dt.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:51.180
So in our case, it's going to
be h times 1 minus e^j times

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:58.465
the indicator function of tau
bigger than T, plus J dN_t.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:14.860
OK, so we're-- not dS_t, sorry.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.030
This is d log of S_t.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.790
OK, so now what
do we want to do?

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.860
We want to integrate
this equation.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.040
So essentially, what we're going
to do is write integral from 0

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.295
to capital T of d of log S_t.

00:41:32.295 --> 00:41:35.120
We integrate both
sides-- integral

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:48.340
from 0 to capital T, h 1 minus e
to the J, tau is bigger than t,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:55.770
times-- here has a dt in here--
times dt plus integral from 0

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.950
to t of J dN_t.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:09.080
OK, so then this I just
gives me essentially the log

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.470
of S_T over S_0.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.270
This is just basic calculus.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:26.510
And then here we have-- we
can-- this indicator function

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.880
just says if tau is
bigger than t, it's 1.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.820
If tau is less than
t, then it's 0.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.940
That's basically what it is.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.370
So I know that
essentially, this is only 1

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.500
when t is less than tau.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.660
So my integral goes
from 0 to tau now.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.500
I can replace this from
an integral from 0 to tau.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.580
And I can take out the
indicator function now.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:43:00.670
Of h, 1 minus e to the J, dt.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:13.300
And then I can say, well,
what if tau is bigger

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:27.660
than-- there is also a
possibility here that tau is--

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.660
this is tau is less
than capital T.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.400
And there's also a
possibility that tau

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.685
is greater than capital
T. In which case,

00:43:36.685 --> 00:43:38.060
if tau is greater
than capital T,

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.270
this integral is there without
any indicator functions.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:47.710
So again, integral from 0
to capital T of h 1 minus

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:53.410
e to the J dt times
indicator function,

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.650
tau being greater
than capital T.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:44:02.850
So I kind of divided this,
counting both possibilities

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.920
separately, essentially.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.680
And now the second
part, integral from 0

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.050
to capital T of J dN_t.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:15.690
Now, N is-- what was N?

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:24.520
Well, N of t is
essentially-- it starts out

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:32.870
as 0 for t less than tau,
and then becomes 1 for t

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:33.630
bigger than tau.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:43.570
So this integral is
just-- J is a constant,

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.730
so it's just J times N of t.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.220
And this is capital T here.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.340
And by the way, all these
derivations are posted

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.970
on the notes, so you don't
necessarily have to worry

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:05.000
if you can't-- can I
can move this board up?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.634
Not really.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.580
So I'm going to
do one more line.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.020
I'm going to erase
this top line.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.590
So we get to here, and there's
one more step, which is now

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.750
to actually do the integration.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:38.290
We're going to have
log of S_T over S_0.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:44.940
Well, two things-- now,
if tau is less than T--

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.950
so default happened before
capital T-- then what is N_t?

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.910
N_t is going to be 1.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:46:03.520
So I can say this equals to h
tau times 1 minus e to the J.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:11.460
This is the first-- this
integral now-- plus J.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.410
So this is if tau
is less than T.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:21.670
And then if tau is bigger
than T, then this term is 0.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.890
This is a term that's
for tau bigger than T.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:29.250
This is just a constant, so it
just becomes h times capital T,

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:35.090
1 minus e to the J times
indicator function of tau

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:39.430
bigger than or equal to T.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.220
And we can then
exponentiate both sides.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:48.830
And it becomes-- use the
magic of the blackboard.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:49.980
You can erase.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.480
S_T equals S_0 times
the exponential of this.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:06.160
So I have-- this is what my
exchange rate is going to be,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.140
essentially, at time capital T.
Now, what was I trying to do?

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.860
I was trying to do this--
to compute this expectation.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.360
With the computed
expectation, now I

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.650
have to integrate
over the probability

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.880
distribution of tau.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.200
Now remember, probability
distribution of tau

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.930
is a Poisson process.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:38.940
So we have essentially-- I'll
write it here-- phi of 0,

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:45.520
t is just h times
e to the minus ht.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.290
That's kind of the
probability density of tau.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.780
So now what I need
to do is essentially,

00:47:52.780 --> 00:48:00.480
the expectation of S_T is just
the integral from 0 to infinity

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.990
of S of tau, times
phi(0, tau) d tau.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:11.085
So here is my S of T. You
can think of this S of T

00:48:11.085 --> 00:48:17.370
of tau for time tau.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.280
So this is for a given time tau,
I know what my value of S of T

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.110
is.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.080
So I can do this integral.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.270
And now we're going to do it.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.680
So what is going to
be the first term?

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:38.230
So exponential of S_T-- not
exponential, expectation of S_T

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:45.600
is going to be--
it's going to be

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.010
integral from 0 to capital T.
It's going to have two terms.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.740
First, I'm going to integrate
from 0 to capital T.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.880
And then I'm going to integrate
from capital T to infinity.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.670
I'll split this
integral into two parts.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:06.990
And from 0 to capital
T, I have essentially--

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:12.870
h times e to the minus h*tau.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.910
And this is my density function.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.250
And then I'm going
to plug that in here.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.760
So this is for tau
being less than T,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.430
so it's basically
this first term.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.630
I'm going to divide it by
0 here, to make it easy.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:35.580
So first term is going to be
e to the h*tau times 1 minus e

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:50.250
to the J plus J. OK,
and so this is d tau.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.760
So this is the first
part from 0 to T.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.190
And the second part is
essentially the integral

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:02.270
from capital T to
infinity for tau

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.140
being bigger than capital T.
Now that's actually-- this part

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.270
here does not depend on tau.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.100
It's a constant.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.110
So it would be just h,
capital T, 1 minus e

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:19.000
to the J times-- what's the
probability of tau being bigger

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.610
than capital T?

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.380
That's just the cumulative
probability distribution

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.430
we saw before, just
e to the minus hT.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.890
That's the probability
that tau is bigger than T.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:42.820
OK so it's e to the hT,
1 minus e to the J times

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.820
e to the minus hT.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.620
So I can now simplify
this expression somewhat.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:55.460
You can see that, say, this
term and this term, this term

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.880
and this term go away.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:03.110
And also this term
and this go away.

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:16.180
So I'm left with the integral
from 0 to T of, essentially,

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:31.410
h times e to minus h*tau e
to the J times e to the J.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:36.720
So you can think of this as
h times e to the J times e

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.430
to the minus h*tau
e to the J d tau,

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:51.440
plus e to the minus h capital T
times e to the J. So this is--

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.710
if I think if h e to the J as
this is the constant in front

00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:01.450
of tau, this is just a standard
integral of exponential,

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:05.440
so this just
becomes, essentially,

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:17.210
e to the minus hT e to the J,
minus 1 plus e to the minus hT

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.010
e to the J.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:24.310
And these two terms are
going to cancel out.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.860
And I'm going to have 1.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.650
So again, the ratio of e to the
S_T over S_0 just gives you 1.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.110
So all this is just
to kind of show you

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:36.820
a little bit how you
work with jump processes,

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.280
and take expectations.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.140
It's not-- nothing you
haven't seen in terms of math.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.320
It's just slightly different
from Brownian motions.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.110
But still the same
idea-- you have dN

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.000
and you have a compensator term.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.340
So this here proves that,
essentially, my drift

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.970
guess that I started
with, in fact

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.410
does make my expectation 0.

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.300
OK, so what have we done so far?

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.620
We've defined
dynamics for log of S

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.610
with jump on default,
defined probability density.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:14.180
And now we have to derive
the dynamics of S, price euro

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.970
bonds, hedge ratios, and so on.

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:27.620
OK so log of S dynamics,
we-- I apologize again

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:34.272
for the small font-- here
we have the log S dynamics.

00:53:34.272 --> 00:53:43.405
Applying Ito's lemma, there
is an equivalent-- Ito's lemma

00:53:43.405 --> 00:53:46.870
you know from Brownian motion,
but there is another one

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:50.900
for Poisson processes, as well.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.340
And that is-- Ito's lemma
is like the chain rule.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:54:00.560
So if you know the
process for some log of S,

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.610
how do you find the
process for S itself?

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:12.130
Well, in this case, what's
going to happen is our dS over S

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:20.130
is going to be the same drift--
h times 1 minus e to the J,

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:30.440
tau is less than T, dT--
sorry, T less than tau-- plus e

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:40.360
to the J minus 1, so
J minus 1, dN, dN_t.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:51.548
So that's really the
derivation of the--

00:54:51.548 --> 00:54:57.680
that's the final result for
S. Now, how do we get to this?

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.962
Well maybe I should-- I
can write Ito's lemma.

00:55:03.962 --> 00:55:04.670
What does it say?

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:08.750
Ito's lemma basically
says that if we have dX_t

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:15.870
is equal mu dt plus J dN,
then-- and you have a function

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:23.580
Y of t, which is
f of X_t, then dY

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:48.880
is df/dx mu dT plus f of X_t
plus J minus f of X_t dN_t.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:56:00.890
So this is the kind
of the term that

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.860
is kind of an analog of the
convexity term in your Brownian

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:08.890
motion Ito's lemma, but
it's now for jump processes.

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:11.900
So this f of X_t plus J
and f of X_t-- so what

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.210
happens, essentially, so you
have some function f, and X_t

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.700
plus J is what happens
if a jump happens.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.350
And X_t is before the
jump, so the effect

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:24.760
of the jump on the function.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.730
That's what this term is.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:30.720
That's like the convexity term.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.310
I think of as a convexity term.

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:34.530
I don't know how it's called.

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:38.290
Maybe more mathematical
minds here might.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:42.510
So in our case, if you
look at the top equation,

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:47.250
our function is just
essentially the exponent.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:51.390
And what happens is when
the function goes up by J

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:55.850
is that the exponent goes
e to the J minus e to 0.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:58.470
That's what this term is.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:04.470
OK, so that's how you
write the equation.

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:12.560
And now the SDE, solving
the SDE generally

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.050
means write down what S is.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.740
So we have S of t.

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:25.207
In our case, it's going
to be S of little t.

00:57:25.207 --> 00:57:26.290
I'm not going to write it.

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:27.600
You have it on the board.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:34.700
I think we're going to get
late, so hurry up a little bit.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:40.280
We're going to the next part,
which is the pricing exercise.

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.140
So we have two bonds--
zero-coupon, zero-recovery

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:43.970
bonds.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.335
One pays $1.

00:57:45.335 --> 00:57:47.870
The other pays one euro.

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:51.400
So how are we going
to price this?

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.710
We have to use our model.

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.140
We have a model for the FX rate.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.690
We have a model for credit.

00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.569
So we price both
bonds in dollars.

00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:02.360
What is the price in
dollars for each bond?

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.690
And the ratio of prices
kind of gives you

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.070
the ratio of the notionals
in your hedge portfolio,

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.140
if you want to hedge
one against the other.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.555
So it's a zero-coupon bond.

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.070
So I wrote here the
dollar bond price is this.

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:22.580
So why do I write it like that?

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.230
Well, it's a zero-coupon bond.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:35.220
So what a zero-coupon bond
says is at maturity, it pays 1.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.190
So we have something
where the payoff at time T

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:46.370
is either 1 if tau
is bigger than T,

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:52.760
or 0 if tau is less than T.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.770
OK, so now what is my price?

00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:01.120
Well, I know that standard
pricing theory tells me

00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:13.130
that the price of time little
t is equal to expectation

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:18.800
of a price at time big
T. And you can kind of

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.940
say there is a money
market account.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.940
But money market
accounts, in our case,

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.000
is just 1, because
interest rates are 0.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.630
So that's really just the case.

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:29.860
That's just true.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.680
So now the expectation
of this-- well,

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.780
that's just equal to the
expectation of an indicator

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:39.250
function of tau bigger
than T, which just equals

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:50.080
to the probability of tau bigger
than T. So if that's true,

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.140
we know what that is.

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.900
That's just the
probability-- that's

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:58.180
the cumulative probability
function e to the minus hT.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.720
That's why the price
of the bond in dollars

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.530
has to be e to the minus hT.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:15.800
Euro bond price-- same
idea, except euro bond

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.390
price in dollars is that.

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:23.260
So why is the euro bond
price in dollars like that?

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:32.070
Well, the euro bond
price in dollars, again,

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:33.840
what is the payoff?

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.880
Same payoff, except the
payoff is in euros, right?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.660
So if I want to do the payoff
of my bond in dollars-- so this,

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.590
I'm going to call
this the euro bond.

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:46.480
But the payoff now, if I
want to do it in dollars,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.100
is not really 1.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:56.610
It's 1 times S of T,
and 0 times S of T.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.400
That's really my payoff.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.370
So then the expectation here
is not just 1, but actually

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:06.660
S of T. So now I
have something where

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:12.170
I have to take the
expectation of S of T,

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:16.060
essentially, at maturity.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:24.080
My bond price in euros is equal
to the expectation of S of T.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.130
And what is my
expectation of S of T?

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:34.010
Well, it's e to the minus
hT times e to the J.

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.930
And that's the
expectation of S of T

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:40.990
the indicator function of
tau bigger than T, right?

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:43.920
So not just-- the expectation
of S of T is S of 0,

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.150
but the expectation of
S of T times indicator

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.470
function only in the cases of
tau bigger than capital T. Now,

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:52.170
that's not 0.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:59.010
That's basically this-- e to
the minus hT times e to the J.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:07.650
OK, so what can we do?

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.490
Well, we construct
a-- what we should do

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.470
is we construct a
portfolio at time

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:15.410
equals 0, which is we
sell one dollar bond,

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:19.220
and we buy this much
amount here of euro bonds.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.420
And the portfolio value at
time equals t equals 0 is 0.

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:32.460
Basically, you can take-- so
e to the hT, the first bond,

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.340
you would get e to the minus hT.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.085
And from the second amount
would cost you e to the minus hT

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.410
to buy.

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:42.950
That's how I've chosen
these scaling factors.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.420
We start a portfolio
which costs 0.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.210
And I should probably--
I'm going to go back here,

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:55.826
and going to write
down the notionals,

01:02:55.826 --> 01:02:56.700
because we lost them.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.114
So how many dollar
bonds do we have?

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.610
We have minus 1.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:10.560
And how many euro
bonds do we have?

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:20.610
We have e to the
minus hT times 1

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:27.050
minus e to the J. This is
how many bonds we have.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:31.440
OK, so some time
delta T later, what

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.810
happens to our bond prices?

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.050
Well, we know what
the bond prices are.

01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:40.190
The only thing that changed
was that some time expired.

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:43.550
So now instead of capital
T, we have T minus delta T

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:45.537
to expiration.

01:03:45.537 --> 01:03:47.620
So these are the bond
prices if we didn't default.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.390
Of course, if we defaulted,
then the bond prices are 0.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:56.540
So obviously, if we defaulted,
since both bond prices are 0,

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.530
we started with the a
portfolio that's worth 0.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.029
If default happened, now we
have a portfolio that's worth 0.

01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:03.660
So nothing changed, right?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.740
So the key part is, OK, now
what if default didn't happen?

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.402
Would we have the
same price as well?

01:04:10.402 --> 01:04:11.610
That's what we want to check.

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.250
And if we have the same price,
both in the case of default

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.120
and in the case of no default,
then that means we have,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.064
essentially, a replicated
portfolio-- a hedged portfolio.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.710
OK, so what is the
value of the bonds

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.010
if default did not happen?

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:35.970
Again, we have these
is a dollar bonds here,

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:40.800
and these are the euro bonds,
and this is my FX rate.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.030
Why did my FX rate move?

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:44.279
Well, because default
did not happen,

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:45.320
so a jump did not happen.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.278
But still I had my drift,
my compensator drift,

01:04:47.278 --> 01:04:51.290
so FX drifts in the
opposite direction.

01:04:51.290 --> 01:05:00.050
OK, so the dollar
bonds-- dollar bond

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:04.160
that was one bond, minus
1 bond, and the price.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.440
So the value of the
dollar bond is just minus

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:11.710
e to the minus h T minus delta
T. What about the Euro bonds?

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:16.410
Well, the Euro bonds-- here is
the number of bonds we have.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:20.590
This is divided by
S_0, by the way.

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:24.700
In our case, S_0 is 1,
so it doesn't matter.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.730
Price of each bond,
again, we take

01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:33.880
that from-- the price of each
bond comes from this formula.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.400
And then the FX rate--
multiply by the FX rate.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.340
And then when you actually
multiply all these guys out,

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:46.300
you end up with,
essentially, the value

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.680
in dollars of you euro
bond equals, again,

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.610
the value of your dollar bonds.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.390
So we started out with a
portfolio that was worth 0,

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.910
and then some time
delta T later,

01:05:55.910 --> 01:06:02.550
it's worth 0 again, both
in the case of default

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.470
and in the case of no default.

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:06.340
So there's no arbitrage.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.360
In some sense, not
terribly surprising,

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.110
because we actually
derived these prices

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:11.776
based on the assumption
of no arbitrage.

01:06:11.776 --> 01:06:13.240
But it's a good check.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.410
It kind of tells you,
hey, if I actually

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:19.930
follow this model to hedge,
I'm really going to be hedged.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.450
And I'm going to be hedged
not just when default occurs,

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.070
or only if default
does not occur,

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:27.260
but I'm hedged in
both situations--

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.610
if default occurs and
default does not occur.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:32.280
And you can't really
do that unless you

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:39.070
have models that actually
are hybrid models-- that

01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:42.090
allow you to mix and match--
to basically describe

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:44.335
both the current event
and the FX process.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.550
So that's kind of
the usefulness.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:56.090
And the hedging strategy
you can see-- it's

01:06:56.090 --> 01:07:02.590
interesting that the hedging
strategy-- the hedge ratio

01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.695
depends on the credit riskiness.

01:07:04.695 --> 01:07:08.200
So how much bonds we
bought depends on J. First

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.110
it depends on h, the
credit riskiness.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.955
And it also depends
on J, the jump size.

01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:14.340
So it really depends.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.840
How many bonds you use--
how many Euro bonds you

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.140
buy to hedge your
dollar bonds, it

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.930
depends on both the
probability of default

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:24.530
and on the jump size.

01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:30.570
So that's what I mean by it
depends on credit riskiness.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:35.180
It's also dynamic, in the
sense that for a given amount

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.010
of dollar bonds, the amount
of euro bonds you need to sell

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:46.430
is going to vary as FX
and time goes forward.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:51.490
As you can see, if you have
one day before expiration,

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:52.990
the hedge ratio of
the two are going

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.970
to be different than one
year before expiration.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.180
So you have to be rebalancing
your portfolio continuously.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.610
Which is not--
again, not unusual.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:05.680
If you're hedging an option,
they also have to rebalance.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.760
But it's different from, say,
a static replication strategy,

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.260
where you say, I'm going to
buy x amount of euro bonds,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.801
x amount of dollar
bonds, and I won't

01:08:13.801 --> 01:08:15.519
have to ever worry about it.

01:08:15.519 --> 01:08:16.560
It's not really the case.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.160
Here you're saying, well,
I buy this ratio of bonds,

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.689
and if default does
not happen, I'm

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:23.450
going to have to
readjust my ratio.

01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.859
Because the original
ratio took into account

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:27.601
the probability of
default happening.

01:08:27.601 --> 01:08:29.100
And if default did
not happen, now I

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.689
have some information--
extra information.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:34.350
And now I have to readjust
my ratio to reflect that.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:42.950
So what happens if
recovery is bigger than 0?

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:46.729
And by the way, how much time
do we have-- a quick check?

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:48.479
PROFESSOR: We have
till 4 o'clock.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:49.270
STEFAN ANDREEV: OK.

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.850
So we have about 12
minutes, 10 minutes.

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.310
OK, Good.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:57.689
So what happens in case the
recovery is bigger than 0?

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:05.550
Well, if recovery
is bigger than 0,

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:08.979
we can go through this
exercise that we did, again,

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.680
the pricing exercise,
and see what

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.520
happens to our bond prices.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.060
So let's do this for
dollars and euro bonds,

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.939
just to give an example of
some of the complexity that

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:28.770
can arise when you start making
the model more realistic.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.899
Because usually bonds do
not have zero recovery.

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:35.430
So then we assume that our
payoff of the zero coupon, zero

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:40.100
recovery bonds was 1 if
default doesn't happen, 0

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.010
if default happens.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:46.229
Now, it's going to be the
payoff of dollar bond at time

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:55.530
T is going to be 1 if
default did not happen,

01:09:55.530 --> 01:10:05.840
so if tau is bigger than T, and
R if default was less than T.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.910
OK, so now when we
price our expectation,

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.180
it's going to be like this.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.190
P of little t would
be just expectation

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:26.680
at time little t of-- or
let's say in this case,

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.660
I'll call expectation
the initial price of 0--

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:36.760
the expectation of P
of capital T, which

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:43.090
is equal to expectation
of essentially

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:53.930
1 of tau bigger than T plus
R 1 of tau less than T.

01:10:53.930 --> 01:11:00.550
Well, what we have
here is essentially--

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:07.600
so you can think we have
this first guy is going

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:18.570
to be e to the-- if tau bigger
than T, it's e to the minus hT.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:22.940
And the second guy plus
R times the probability

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.940
of tau being less than T,
is 1 minus the probability

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:31.966
of tau being bigger than T,
so 1 minus e to the minus hT.

01:11:31.966 --> 01:11:48.260
Which essentially gives you R
plus e to the minus hT times 1

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:55.810
minus R. So that's how you
derive the dollar bond price.

01:11:55.810 --> 01:12:00.510
And for the euro bond price,
you would do the same thing,

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:04.900
except now these will be
multiplied by the FX rate.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:12.720
And now the FX rate-- the
tricky thing about the FX rate

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.560
is that the FX rate
jumps on default.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.450
So it's not going to
be the same number.

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:26.110
So in this case, P_T-- this is
for one kind of dollar unit--

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:30.100
it's 1 times S of T
and R times S of T.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:35.150
So now we have P
little T-- this is

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:44.910
for euros-- the price at time
0 of the euro bond divided

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:56.600
by S_0, that equals to
expected value time 0 of S of T

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:09.481
of tau bigger than T plus R S of
T times tau less than T. Well,

01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:09.980
OK.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.290
The first part, S
of T, tau bigger

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:18.780
than T, that was like the
zero-coupon bond price.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:27.600
So that's just essentially,
the-- in order to really,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.370
I would say, guess
this well, we have

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:35.290
to go back to what was
S of T. So if we go back

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:45.540
to the equation for S
of T, let me write that.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:14:02.100
So S of T is S of little t
times e to the hT, 1 minus e

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:37.790
to the J plus J times
1 tau bigger than T,

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:44.980
this is h tau, tau
less than T, and this

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.670
is-- if tau is less
than T, and then

01:14:49.670 --> 01:15:03.630
times e to the hT, 1 minus e
to the J, tau bigger than T.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:07.590
So if default has
not occurred, S of T

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:19.215
is S of 0-- in this case, S of
T is S of 0 times this term.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.490
And if default has
occurred, then it's

01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:23.040
S of 0 times this term.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.680
So the two terms are the
same, except for the J part.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.165
OK, so now when we try
to do this expectation,

01:15:33.165 --> 01:15:34.540
here we're in the
situation where

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.730
tau-- where default
has not occurred,

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:42.910
so our FX rate is essentially
S_0 times the second term.

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:51.990
So we have expectation
of S_0 times-- well,

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:57.390
and we're kind of dividing
by S_0, so S_0 drops out.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:11.380
e to the hT times 1
minus e to the J. OK,

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:22.260
and when tau bigger than T.
That's the first expectation.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.360
And the second one,
the expectation

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:38.080
of-- so we put this R times the
expectation of-- now here we

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.190
have tau is less than T. So
we're going to have our S of T

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:46.590
is the first part
only would be true.

01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:49.840
Second part would
be 1, so that would

01:16:49.840 --> 01:17:03.896
be the formula-- e to the h tau,
1 minus e to the J plus J times

01:17:03.896 --> 01:17:08.510
1, tau less than T.

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:21.440
So this e to the J
term that you see here

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.330
in the euro price, that
comes from this term here.

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:31.450
So how do I do this expectation?

01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:35.950
Well to do this
expectation, again, you

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:40.000
have to do an
integral, essentially,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.530
over the interval from 0 to
infinity of the probability

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:45.260
density.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.450
Since tau here is bigger
than T, I'm really

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:50.900
integrating from T to infinity.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:58.080
So this here is just a constant.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:05.490
So this first term--
I'll write it here.

01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:16.180
So you have P_0 over
S_0, the first term would

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:23.620
be e to the hT, 1
minus e to the J.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.750
And it's going to be
integral from big T

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.250
to infinity of the partial
differential function,

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.520
so that is just e
to the minus hT.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.020
So this looks like
something we've

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.290
already done before in
the previous calculation.

01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:46.850
And then the second
term is R times-- now

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:51.840
we're integrating from 0 to tau.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:19:00.990
So this would be integrating
from 0 to T, e to the h*tau,

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:08.660
1 minus e to the J plus J-- I
can do like this, e to the J.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.100
Let's put it like that.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:19.730
And times h times e to
the minus h*tau d tau--

01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:26.090
this part being the
distribution function,

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.880
probability
distribution function.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.290
So again, we have
this guy cancels this.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:36.450
And what we're left
with-- first term

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:49.750
gives us e to the minus hT e
to the J plus R times h times

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.230
e to the J times tau.

01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:54.610
This is, again, an
exponent function.

01:19:54.610 --> 01:20:03.296
So we have e to the
hT, e to the J minus 1.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.842
That's true.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:23.530
Oh, sorry, there's a minus
sign here in front of this.

01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:25.960
The reason there's
a minus sign is

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.670
we have minus h e
to the J times tau,

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:31.791
and so we have to put
a minus here in front

01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:32.790
when we do the integral.

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:37.730
So there is a minus
here in front.

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:43.439
So this thing just basically
reduces to that expression

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:43.980
on the board.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:52.910
So that's basically--
so this is how

01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:57.320
we expand the problem to
having non-zero recoveries.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:03.670
What you could do for your
final paper, if you decide

01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:07.750
to do a final paper
on this topic,

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:14.900
is to extend the model one step
further, and say, in our model,

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:20.510
our FX rates jumped, but did
not have any diffusive elements.

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:36.600
It was just-- our equation was d
log of S was mu dT plus J dN_t.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.460
That was our SDE for log of S.

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:44.420
So next step would be
hey, why don't we just add

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.418
another term, plus sigma dW?

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.760
So without the
jump, this is just

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:01.440
a standard, log-normal process
that you know how to do.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.690
Now we add jump, essentially.

01:22:03.690 --> 01:22:05.160
So you take a
log-normal process.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.050
You add a jump process to it.

01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:10.170
And you repeat
the same things we

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.190
were going through
so far-- pricing

01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:16.269
euro bonds, dollar
bonds, and coming up

01:22:16.269 --> 01:22:17.435
with a replication strategy.

01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:26.510
This is, for example, a
model that-- we're currently

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:32.590
working to implement a model
like that at Morgan Stanley.

01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:37.290
Our model has non-zero
interest rates.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.910
It has dynamic interest rates.

01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:43.730
So that makes it a
little bit more complex,

01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:47.390
but overall, it doesn't make
it too much more complex.

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:49.470
Having non-zero interest
rates just kind of

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:51.280
has an extra drift term.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.160
It doesn't really change that
much the mathematics of it.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.830
And the reason why we want
to do that is because we want

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:03.100
to be able to
price, essentially,

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.650
the contracts which are credit
contingent, meaning the payoff

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.560
depends on whether
something has survived

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.820
or not, whether credit
default has occurred or not.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.810
And the payoff is
in units, anything,

01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:17.210
like foreign currency.

01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:20.780
A typical example would
be a credit default swap

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:24.520
denominated in Brazilian reais.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.160
Or that happens-- a
credit default swap

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.140
on Brazil denominated
in Brazilian reais.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:33.050
Now, common sense is that
when Brazil defaults,

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.234
Brazilian real is not
going to cost very much.

01:23:35.234 --> 01:23:37.150
It's not going to be
very valuable, just as we

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:39.930
saw on the graph with the
Argentinian peso, which totally

01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:42.370
devalued, it would
devalue as well.

01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:45.540
Now Brazil is a very big
economy, strong country.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.590
So right now, people are
buying a lot of their bonds.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.650
People are investing in it.

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:53.640
Still, it has credit risk.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.690
And you can buy-- you can
trade the credit risk.

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.110
You can trade credit
default swaps in dollars.

01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:01.180
And you can also
enter into contracts

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.590
that essentially
quanto the credit risk

01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:06.680
into Brazilian currency itself.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.590
And to be able to really
price this, you can do it.

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:14.650
We've done it for many years
without having a jump model.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.660
But then your hedge
ratios are not very good.

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:20.720
And you cannot really
explain the prices you see

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.370
in the market.

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:26.120
So we are essentially
implementing infrastructure

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.390
to-- we've already
implemented this model

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:31.280
or a version of this
model, but we're

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.670
implementing infrastructure
to kind of really

01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:35.450
put it in production.

01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:37.810
As you can see in
this model now,

01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:39.540
your FX process
depends on credit.

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.830
So it actually-- calibration
and all these things

01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:44.900
become a little bit more tricky.

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.950
Which I don't want to worry
about for your final project,

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:52.250
but I think it would be a
very interesting exercise

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:59.780
to take something like
that, and basically

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:02.360
work out all the steps.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360
It does get a little
bit more complicated,

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.830
because now you have to--
if you're doing Ito's lemma,

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:08.970
you've got to do it both
for diffusive processes

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.173
and for a jump
process, so you're

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:15.140
going to have two terms
in your Ito's lemma.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.340
But you've seen them both.

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:19.629
They're in your class notes.

01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:21.170
If you're so inclined,
you can do it.

01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:29.670
And you can-- once
you solve the model,

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:33.810
then you can kind of
check your results.

01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:35.970
You can actually build a
Monte Carlo simulation,

01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:39.440
or actually run a
bunch of paths where

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.850
you simulate both the default
and the diffusive part,

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:47.200
and see if your prices
arrived at analytically match

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.410
with your expectations
computed by Monte Carlo.

01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:54.870
This will be a good-- it's
always a very good check

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:59.300
to see if-- usually, we do this
exercise to check if our Monte

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.650
Carlo simulations is
correct, because we

01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:04.960
know that our math is right.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.350
But you can also do it to
check the other way around.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.630
OK, so in real life,
as we went over--

01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:20.550
I mentioned a couple of
times during the lecture--

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:22.550
our models are more complicated.

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:26.610
We have stochastic interest
rates, stochastic hazard rates.

01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:29.030
So currently, we assumed
that our hazard rate, h,

01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:31.440
is a fixed number.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.445
h can be stochastic as well.

01:26:33.445 --> 01:26:35.070
It can have its
own distribution,

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:40.790
and typically that's what we
use in our models-- stochastic

01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:42.250
effects.

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:45.970
So when I say stochastic, both
jump and diffusion processes.

01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:49.850
And then if you
get really fancy,

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:52.470
then you can start putting
correlations between interest

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:56.350
rates, FX and hazard rates.

01:26:56.350 --> 01:27:01.900
So in particular, having
a jump of FX on default

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.720
naturally introduces
a correlation

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.710
between credit and FX.

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:10.380
When credit occurs, FX devalues.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:13.420
So clearly, there's going
to be a correlation.

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.110
But there also could be a
correlation between the hazard

01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:18.530
rates themselves and FX.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:20.940
So it's another
source of correlation.

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.220
And these correlations would
produce different effects

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.010
in the market.

01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:31.550
So basically, you can, if
you have enough data points,

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:34.260
you'd be able to
say, well, this model

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:37.270
seems like it describes the
market better than that model.

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:39.460
Both of them produce
quanto effects, though.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:49.930
And whether we use analytic
solutions or Monte Carlo,

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:52.680
they're different approaches to
price derivatives and compute

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.860
risk.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.900
It depends, really, on
how complex your model is.

01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.760
And for certain
markets, you'd rather

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.300
have a more complex
model that is slower

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.670
and requires Monte Carlo.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.780
And in other places, you
want to have faster, more

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:13.040
tractable models that can price
your derivatives analytically.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.280
But maybe your
models, they don't

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.780
have as many features in them.

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.980
So there's a whole
range of models

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.980
implemented for various
markets in Morgan Stanley.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:27.860
It's a very big area
of expertise for us.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.520
So I think that's it.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.070
I think I ran a
little bit over time.

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:35.150
I apologize-- five minutes.

01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:37.947
PROFESSOR: Thank
you very, very much.

01:28:37.947 --> 01:28:39.738
And we'll thank our
speaker first, I guess.

01:28:39.738 --> 01:28:42.096
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:42.096 --> 01:28:43.845
I think there's probably
a question or two

01:28:43.845 --> 01:28:47.544
that people might have.

01:28:47.544 --> 01:28:49.793
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if we could now answer which

01:28:49.793 --> 01:28:52.055
of the Italian bets was better.

01:28:52.055 --> 01:28:53.180
STEFAN ANDREEV: Which what?

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.220
AUDIENCE: Which of the
bets that we initially

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.410
were considering on the
Italian bonds was better?

01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:00.056
Could we answer that now?

01:29:00.056 --> 01:29:01.965
Because we haven't, I think.

01:29:01.965 --> 01:29:02.840
STEFAN ANDREEV: Yeah.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.920
Yeah, let's go back.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.565
Which Italian bonds was better?

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:13.730
What was that?

01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:16.090
OK, so let's try to
answer that together.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.040
And we can answer it
within our model, right?

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.680
So in reality, there's
all kinds of factors

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.120
going into the price.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.680
So there's supply
and demand, liquidity

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.740
in euros, liquidity in dollars.

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:36.890
Well, let's say if you're
trying to invest in euros,

01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:42.010
or trying to invest in
dollars, if I invest

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:46.260
in dollars, if a
default happens,

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:50.480
I lose essentially-- let's
say the recovery was zero.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.261
So I lose all my
money in dollars.

01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:54.260
I thought I had some
amount of money in dollars.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.170
Default occurs.

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:59.607
I lost my dollars.

01:29:59.607 --> 01:30:00.440
Same thing in euros.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.260
If I invest in euros, if
default occurs, I lose my euros.

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.790
So how much do I lose
in a case of euros

01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:08.740
and in the case of dollars?

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:13.980
So if I invested euros, you
say, well, if a default happens,

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:19.250
my euros are maybe
not as valuable.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:25.010
So euros are not as
valuable, so I lost my euros,

01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:27.370
but what I lost was not as
much, because already it's

01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:28.910
also the value of the lot.

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:34.570
Conversely, is we saw, because
of the compensator drift--

01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:39.840
remember, if you have a
jump that makes the currency

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.300
devalue upon
default, the currency

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.760
will tend to appreciate
if default doesn't happen.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.590
Because we want the-- the
expected value of the currency

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:52.110
has to be-- that's determined
by interest rates parity,

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:55.310
the first thing we talked
about-- the interest rate

01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:56.760
differential.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.422
So that is kind of an
ironclad arbitrage condition

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:02.380
that we have to follow.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.240
So if you want your FX forward
to really-- the expected value

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.400
of your FX to remain fixed by
the interest rate differential,

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.610
and you know that upon default,
your currency would devalue,

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:16.150
that means if the
currency does not devalue,

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.539
it's going to appreciate.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.080
Because if a default
does not happen,

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.220
the currency would appreciate
relatively speaking.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.070
So in our case, when
we're buying bonds,

01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:29.690
we only get paid if
default does not occur.

01:31:29.690 --> 01:31:34.090
So you would
rather, essentially,

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:37.740
buy the bonds in
the currency that's

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:40.140
going to relatively
appreciate, essentially.

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:43.200
Suppose interest rates
were zero in both cases.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.480
You would rather buy the bond
where FX would appreciate it

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.710
default does not occur.

01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:51.140
Because if it occurs, you get
nothing in any case, right?

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.120
But if it doesn't occur,
when you get paid,

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.525
you want something that would
appreciate versus something

01:31:55.525 --> 01:31:56.150
that would not.

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.590
So the dollar,
for example, let's

01:31:57.590 --> 01:32:01.320
say the dollar doesn't move
versus other currencies

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.010
when the euro default happens.

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:08.550
So you'd rather
get the euro bonds.

01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:11.750
AUDIENCE: If you want
to estimate recovery,

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.382
can you use a
bunch-- I mean, not

01:32:13.382 --> 01:32:15.090
necessarily factors
already in the model,

01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:19.180
but outside factors like
macroeconomic factors

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.865
to predict the expected
value of recovery?

01:32:21.865 --> 01:32:23.240
STEFAN ANDREEV:
Absolutely, yeah.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.810
Recovery is something that
we cannot really price,

01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:30.550
necessarily, because
usually we have bonds.

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:35.830
And the bond price-- you can say
we model default, probability

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:38.019
of default versus
probability of non-default.

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:40.060
But now if you introduce
a second variable, which

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.500
is the recovery, now you have
essentially both probability

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.760
of defaults and recovery
amount as variables.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.980
And you have only price
as your data point.

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:53.250
And you can have
infinitely many solutions.

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:55.870
So typically, what
happens is you

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.710
fix the recovery at something.

01:32:57.710 --> 01:33:00.080
Now what do we use
to fix the recovery?

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.920
Well, for sovereign
countries we use 25%

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.682
and for corporates we use 40%.

01:33:06.682 --> 01:33:08.140
But these numbers--
everybody knows

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.650
that they're kind
of just conventions,

01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:12.190
really, more than anything.

01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:17.270
We don't really believe that
recovery is really 40% or 25%.

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:19.264
It varies a lot by corporation.

01:33:19.264 --> 01:33:20.930
And there are studies
by credit agencies

01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:25.270
about how much recoveries--
what are the recoveries

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:28.520
for various bonds.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.040
And this 25% for
sovereign is based

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.650
on some study like that
that went over the last 50

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:37.400
years, looked at the
recoveries of sovereigns,

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.940
of which there are not
that many every year.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.250
But if you look at 50
years, there's quite a few.

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:44.664
And then they made
some statements--

01:33:44.664 --> 01:33:46.330
some recover higher,
some recover lower,

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:49.180
but on average,
they recover 25%.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.190
If you remember in Greece,
what happened in Greece,

01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:56.230
how much did bondholders in
Greece get for their bonds?

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.270
Now, they didn't really
default, technically.

01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:59.728
Well, they did
default technically,

01:33:59.728 --> 01:34:01.510
but it was a very
managed process.

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:05.541
But they got definitely
less than 25%.

01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:07.540
I think they got something
on the order of $0.15

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.010
on the dollar.

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:14.420
So recovery there was, like
I say, was less than 25%.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.330
Same for this Argentinian
default I'm talking about,

01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.820
the 2001-- Argentina
is still being

01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:27.000
sued by creditors trying to
get money back from this.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.522
And it's a big
thing in the news.

01:34:28.522 --> 01:34:30.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you
have a claim from Argentina

01:34:30.855 --> 01:34:34.480
and they fly over, it can be
seized by [INAUDIBLE] funds.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.480
STEFAN ANDREEV: Exactly.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.260
They tried to do
some settlements.

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.302
So how much did people recover?

01:34:39.302 --> 01:34:40.510
Well, it depends who you are.

01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:44.300
If you took the original deal,
maybe you got $0.20, $0.25,

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:45.634
$0.30 on the dollar.

01:34:45.634 --> 01:34:47.050
Maybe you got $0.20
on the dollar.

01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:48.800
But now if you hold
out-- if you held out,

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.020
apparently you got a
little bit more eventually.

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:53.992
So it's a little bit
of a fuzzy concept.

01:34:53.992 --> 01:34:55.700
But it's not something--
you usually make

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:59.170
an assumption of what it is.

01:34:59.170 --> 01:35:00.670
AUDIENCE: And in a
related question,

01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:04.950
so how would we also
estimate the other constants

01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:08.190
like the hazard rate and the J?

01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:11.240
STEFAN ANDREEV: So once
you fix the recovery rate,

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.240
then you can take
the bond price.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.935
And because bond
price theoretically

01:35:14.935 --> 01:35:19.260
is e to the minus hT, you can
estimate h from the bond price.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.340
So if you observe a bond
price in the market,

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.206
you can say, I'm
going to estimate h.

01:35:23.206 --> 01:35:25.580
So let's say I'm going to take
some benchmark bonds which

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.490
I know the price of, and
I'm going to estimate h

01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:29.760
for each of these bond prices.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.690
And I'm going to
create a curve, which

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.510
is going to be my hazard curve.

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:37.650
And then I take another
derivative or bond

01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:41.290
that I don't know the price of,
and I can use the same curve

01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:42.730
to price it.

01:35:42.730 --> 01:35:46.270
So essentially by doing
this, what I'm saying is,

01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:47.890
I'm going to replicate
my derivative

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:50.030
using these benchmark
bonds as much as I can.

01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:54.997
That's the assumption
that I'm making.

01:35:57.931 --> 01:36:01.360
AUDIENCE: And how
long [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.710
if multiple currencies
are involved,

01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:06.700
if we are trying to trade with
multiple different currencies,

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.144
how does the whole model differ?

01:36:09.144 --> 01:36:11.310
STEFAN ANDREEV: If multiple
currencies are involved,

01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:17.310
you can-- first you
can-- it becomes tricky.

01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:20.429
You can say each currency
can devalue X amount.

01:36:20.429 --> 01:36:22.720
If default happens, you can
have more than one currency

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.090
being devalued.

01:36:25.090 --> 01:36:26.640
If you have more
than one currency,

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.230
if you have more
than two currencies,

01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:30.550
like three currencies,
there's other identities

01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:33.020
you have to take care.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.770
You really simulate-- if
you have three currencies,

01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:38.140
there is a triangle
identity that, say,

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.260
dollar-euros times
euro-yen exchange rate

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:42.230
has to equal to
dollar-yen exchange rate.

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:45.440
That's kind of an
arbitrage condition.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.390
Just like interest rate
FX forward parity--

01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:50.420
even stronger in some sense.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:55.820
And so you can basically,
you can write down

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:57.680
multiple processes
and price stuff.

01:37:00.479 --> 01:37:02.020
AUDIENCE: How much
do these equations

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.900
change when you add in bonds
that are paying coupons?

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.340
And how do you factor in
duration and all that?

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:09.975
STEFAN ANDREEV: Well, you
just-- it's not hard, really.

01:37:09.975 --> 01:37:12.630
You just, instead of
having this, you just

01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:15.560
write down all the coupon
payments, when you pay them.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.510
And then you just
take an expectation

01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:20.220
of all the coupon payments.

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.940
So it's really the same process.

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.440
You just repeat it
for every coupon.

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:28.380
PROFESSOR: Why don't we shut
the formal class over now.

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.839
But if people have questions
afterwards, we'll [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:30.839 --> 01:37:32.296
STEFAN ANDREEV:
Yeah, I'm certainly

01:37:32.296 --> 01:37:34.270
around to answer questions,
if anybody wants.

01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.570
PROFESSOR: Thank you very much.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.420
STEFAN ANDREEV: Thank you.

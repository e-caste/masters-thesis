00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:23.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Hey guys.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.440
So quick announcement, we're
not doing nuclear activation

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.870
analysis today,
because the valve that

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.640
shoots the rabbits
into the reactor

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.350
broke and needs to be repaired.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.410
So we'll likely just
do this next Friday.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.370
And instead, we'll have
the whole recitation

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.880
for exam review,
like I think we'd

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.018
originally, originally planned.

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:42.310
I also want to say thanks to
whoever said, please write

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.720
lecture notes for this class.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.850
It's something I think
needs to be done.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.040
And I just now biked
back from meeting

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.140
with a publisher, or
a potential publisher,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.802
to actually get this done.

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.510
Because as I think as
you guys have seen,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.718
there's no one reading that
does this course justice.

00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:57.093
There are some
that are too easy,

00:00:57.093 --> 00:00:58.480
there are some
that are too hard.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.950
And there are giant
pieces missing,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.350
like most of what we're
going to go into today--

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.700
sources of background radiation.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.640
And where do cosmic rays
come from, and what are they?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160
So thanks to whoever said
that, because it spurred me off

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.145
on a let's make this into
a book kind of thing.

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.020
Want to quickly review
what we did last time.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.290
We went over all the different
units of dose and radiation

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.510
exposure, from the roentgen--

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.140
which is pretty much just valid
for those measurements in air.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.370
And I realized that yesterday
I brought in the civil defense

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.830
dosimeter and passed
it to one person,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.330
and we didn't
continue bringing it.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.980
So I'll bring it to recitation.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.620
It's not in my bag.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.220
There is the unit
of the gray, which

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.038
is just joules per kilogram.

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:39.580
Which you can
calculate from stopping

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.240
power or exponential
attenuation equations.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.860
This is where you
start, because it's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.870
how you get from
the world of physics

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.610
to the world of biology.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
Into units of increased
risk, or sieverts,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.290
which is just gray times a
bunch of quality factors, which

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.170
are either tabulated, or I'd
like to see somewhat better

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.580
calculated.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.240
They are calculated sometimes,
but by empirical relations,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.160
because that's
usually good enough.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.080
Biomeasurements tend
to be pretty sloppy,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.780
and I'm not that upset that
these are empirical relations.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.350
I'm going to skip way ahead
past the detector stuff.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.370
We didn't quite finish
up the IF2D idea.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.740
I think this is where we
ended last time, where

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.170
we were talking about
how do you detect dose

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.760
during cancer treatment.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
And I was outlining one proposed
way that we're thinking of.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.150
Using this F-center
based dosimeter,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.550
which changes color
when it gets irradiated,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.990
you can implant it in the tumor.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.200
And as it moves from things
like breathing or swallowing,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.970
you could feedback
to the proton beam,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.100
and only irradiate
when it's in range.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.800
Or play nuclear operation,
and try not to hit the sides.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.170
However, whatever
you want to do.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.520
And there's multiple
implantation options for this.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.510
We've thought about things
like implanting a fiber optic

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.000
cable into the tumor,
and then having a port

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.220
on the side of you that could
do some in body spectrometry,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.470
which would be pretty cool.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.120
Could also put it all in a chip.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.830
You could have the emitter--

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.440
either a broadband
or single color LED--

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.540
the F-center, and the
spectrometer all in a chip

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.680
that's implanted.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.868
And with radio frequency
power transfer,

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:18.660
so you don't need to
put a fiber optic port

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.520
and plug it into
the side of you.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.790
Or however it goes.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.960
And what we're doing
next in this development

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.150
is nailing down what color
change is given by what dose--

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.490
so the physics.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.500
Develop an on-chip version.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.620
Find a bio-compatible casing.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.160
We've done the IP part,
which is pretty cool.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.320
As you can see with
patent office at least

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.983
has taken in the application.

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:45.400
But it's neat that you need
to know pretty much everything

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.525
you learned at MIT to pull
off a project like this.

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.140
From the nuclear physics
stuff, to the material science,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.340
to the 22.071 electronics, to
the medical stuff for biology,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.620
to the financial stuff for econ.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.700
In order to pull off
an actual nuclear start

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.075
up project like this, you need
everything you learn here.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:03.720
Which is kind of
a neat case study.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.980
But now let's get back into
what does a sievert really mean

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.080
in terms of increased risk?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.810
Usually means the
increased risk of some sort

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.650
of long-term biological
effect, whether it's cancer

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.740
or some other genetic
effects-- let's say mutations--

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.320
anything that would take
a while to manifest,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.760
and would manifest by slow
but steady cell division.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.200
And if you notice the
difference between adults

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.730
and whole population,
let's see--

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.240
yeah, sorry.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.710
You can see right
here that these--

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.330
not very much dose.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.250
Let's say in the realm
of 10 to the minus 2

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.430
sieverts can give you some
increased risk for cancer

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.720
or some other effect.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.110
So we're talking on the
realm of 40 millisieverts

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.700
or so would give you some
additional cancer risk.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.400
That's not a lot of dose.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.920
That's up to about the limit
of the occupational dose

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.528
that you're allowed.

00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:59.320
So when we talk about
how much is too much,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.340
I've taken some excerpts
from this Committee

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.650
on Radiation
Protection document.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.720
This is from Turner,
but the entire document,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.240
as I mentioned, is up on
the learning module site.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.050
So you guys can see the actual
verbiage where this is defined.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.000
So your lifetime
dose should never

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.440
exceed in tens of millisieverts
the value of age in years.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.960
Which means in some years if
you get a little bit less dose,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.820
you can get a
little bit more dose

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.410
and still be
considered safe or not

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.680
have any appreciable
increased risk.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.810
And while you're
working, you should never

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.920
get more than about 50
millisieverts in a given year.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.360
How was it for
radiation workers?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.263
So for you guys,
what dose are you

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:39.930
allowed per year
working at the reactor?

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.895
AUDIENCE: About
five rem per year.

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:43.270
MICHAEL SHORT:
Five rem per year,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.040
which is 50 millisieverts.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.790
Awesome, so it's--

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] to
your eyes [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:51.912 --> 00:05:53.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh sure, yeah.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.620
To jump back to that, if you're
saying that there's actually

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.170
tabulated differences
for different organs,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.480
that's where they come from.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.030
Let's say you can take less
radiation to the same organ

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.550
and get the same
dose in sieverts

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.900
measured in equivalent risk.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.360
So I wouldn't be surprised
if these are the organs

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.940
that you're not allowed
to irradiate as much.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.410
MICHAEL SHORT: I'm surprised
the eye isn't here.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.410
Does it say retina anywhere?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.100
Oh, OK.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.810
Well that's just one table.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.900
It's not necessarily
the complete answer.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.300
Yeah, so 50 millisieverts
isn't that much.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.570
Although if you think of it in
the old xkcd units of banana

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.030
equivalent dose, eating
a banana gives you

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.640
about 0.1 microsieverts.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.040
So you would have to eat
50,000 bananas in a year--

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.030
no, I'm sorry, 500,000 bananas
in order to incur that.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.570
Well yeah, I was talking
to someone at dinner

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.400
last night about
the banana burning

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.520
experiment where we measured
the activity in becquerels.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.907
And then we can calculate
how much dose in sieverts

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:01.490
it would take.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.080
And he said, how
many bananas would it

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.360
take to get some
increased cancer risk?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.230
About double this.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.772
It would take about
a million bananas

00:07:07.772 --> 00:07:09.545
to give you about
100 millisieverts.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:11.420
And I said, you know
what else it would cost?

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.800
And he goes, 100 millisieverts.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.678
No shit.

00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:14.720
And I said, that's right.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.530
Yeah.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.470
Yeah, he totally
didn't plan that,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.380
but it just worked out that way.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.990
Yeah.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.830
And then how much is too much?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.060
Let's say for the general public
for a background for excluding

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.300
things like natural background
and medical exposures,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.000
you're not supposed to get about
more than one millisievert just

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.500
walking about outside.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.860
And you don't tend to
get that much more.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.470
Why are medical exposures not
included, despite them being

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.781
pretty radioactive procedures?

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:50.281
Yeah?

00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:52.149
AUDIENCE: Because
they're very targeted.

00:07:54.485 --> 00:07:55.860
MICHAEL SHORT:
They are targeted,

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.230
and so they could give a lot
of dose to certain organs.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.540
But the amount of
dose isn't necessarily

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.240
why we don't count
medical procedures.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.016
Anyone have any idea?

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:05.796
Yeah.

00:08:05.796 --> 00:08:08.004
AUDIENCE: Was it because
usually you wear a lead vest

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:09.690
if you're getting an X-ray?

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.190
MICHAEL SHORT: In some cases,
like if you go to the dentist,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.190
you'll get a lead X-ray.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.200
But let's say you
get a chest X-ray.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.400
Why don't we care that a chest
X-ray is way more than you get?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.840
Because these things
tend to save lives.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.090
So you're absolutely willing
to get extra radiation exposure

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.640
that may have a delayed effect
if the immediate effect is

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.520
to save your life.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.570
You had a question?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.539
Or no.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.159
OK.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.830
Yeah, so we don't
count medical things

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.500
because chances are you're
doing them to improve or save

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.000
your life.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.860
So what's a little
bit of radiation

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.800
compared to let's say finding
the blood clot or the aneurysm

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.600
or whatever it would take?

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.310
And then how much is enough?

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.932
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's the table.

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:56.390
MICHAEL SHORT: This is the
table that you're familiar with?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:56.890
Yeah.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.910
They actually talk about
the lens of the eye.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.220
And that's a heftier dose.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.900
But also, the lens of the eye
is not a very massive organ.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.820
So this would mean do not stick
remaining eye in neutron beam,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.730
right?

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.240
Or you've seen that
sticker, do not

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.270
stare into a laser
with remaining eye.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.030
Yeah, the same goes for the
neutron beam ports coming out

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.170
of the reactor.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.460
But the lens of the eye can take
a fair bit more dose per unit

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.890
mass than the whole body.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.260
The lens of the eye is not a
particularly fast developing

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.760
tissue.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.390
It can cloud up with an insane
amount of radiation exposure.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.450
That would take a lot more
than 150 millisieverts to do,

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.200
though.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.970
And then things like
500 millisieverts

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.680
for skin, hands, feet.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.260
Pretty much just groups of
muscle, bone, and dead skin

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.250
that not much is
going on biologically.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.000
Blood's flowing through
it, but that's about it.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.150
And notice that the regulations
do differ a little bit,

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.280
but on the whole,
they're fairly similar.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.310
Same for the eye, same for
the feet, same for the year.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.030
Cumulative is a
little different.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.420
This says 10
millisieverts times age.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.358
This allows you a
little bit more.

00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:05.900
Whichever recommendations
you follow,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.000
they're all pretty similar.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.710
And our knowledge
of how much dose

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.260
leads to how much
risk hasn't changed

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.440
a ton in the last decade or so.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.280
There's been all sorts of
arguments for or against it.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.020
Has anyone heard of this
LNT or Linear No Threshold

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.893
model of dose versus risk?

00:10:24.893 --> 00:10:26.310
This is something
we'll talk a lot

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.690
about on the last day of class.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.490
This is the theory
that the amount

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.070
of risk versus the
amount of dose is linear.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.580
And no threshold means that
every little bit of dose

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.230
gives you additional risk.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.580
This is not supported
very much by science.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.950
I'd say it's not
supported by science.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.980
The converse argument is also
not supported by science.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.980
We just don't have the
statistics at super low doses

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.720
to say what happens.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.260
But the official recommendation
is that there is a unit of dose

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:01.840
that we define as nothing,
and it's 0.01 millisieverts--

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.050
about 100 bananas--
per event, let's say--

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.730
yeah, where does it say--
yeah, per source or practice.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.950
So eating 100 bananas
in one sitting

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.100
is considered to give you
zero additional risk according

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.840
to the official guidelines.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.610
So the guidelines
put in place do not

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.680
follow the linear
no threshold model.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.440
But anyone that would claim
that one or the other model

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.500
is absolutely correct has
either got a huge sample

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.210
size of people that
we don't know about,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.280
or is probably
extrapolating beyond what

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.630
the data will tell them.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.400
So you'll see this argument
flaring up quite a bit.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.900
For the last day of class we'll
have you read some arguments

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.623
for and against the linear
no threshold model that

00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:42.040
aren't just blogs
on the internet,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.760
but they're actual
published articles

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.250
that have passed peer review.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.042
And it's really hard
to tell exactly what's

00:11:47.042 --> 00:11:49.062
going on at low doses.

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:50.770
But meanwhile, let's
focus on what you do

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.870
get that we can measure.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.220
The actual contribution from
background levels is about 50%

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.300
radon.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.330
This is a natural decay
product of radium.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.440
It's just everywhere.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.550
It's here right now.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.643
It's all through the atmosphere.

00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:07.060
This is why you
want your basement

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.280
to be rather well
ventilated, because it's

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.470
a heavy noble gas
that accumulates down

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.678
in unventilated basements.

00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:15.220
So you don't actually
want your house

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.887
to be sealed up super
tight, because you

00:12:16.887 --> 00:12:18.610
can have radon accumulation.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.610
Especially if you happen to
live near a granite deposit

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.370
or on granite bedrock-- which
everyone in New Hampshire

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.090
does--

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.010
radon levels are
a little higher.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.510
There's actually a
story about a guy

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.910
that used to work at a
nuclear plant somewhere

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.660
in Pennsylvania.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.080
I don't know where, but he lived
on top of a pretty good granite

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.680
deposit that was a few parts
per million radium more.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.930
So the radon levels in his
house or in his basement

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.450
were much, much higher
than would normally

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.880
be allowed for background.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.630
And this guy used to
set off the radiation

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.220
alarms coming into work.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.350
Then he would breathe
the nice clean radiation

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.010
free air in the plant and go out
without setting off the alarm.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.880
Eventually something
had to be done.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.450
I don't actually know what
was done, but if any of you

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.670
can find that original story,
that would be pretty cool.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.940
Cosmic rays, another source
that you can't shield from,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.740
is about another 10%.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.650
And we'll talk a lot about
where these things come from.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.530
Terrestrial radiation, well
we'll count that as stuff

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.160
in the soil, stuff
in the cinder block.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.990
Wood happens to be a fairly
radioactive substance

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.090
pound for pound, but it's
not very dense compared

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.320
to things like brick or--

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.340
well, banana ashes is probably
about the same as wood.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.695
Internal, coming from you.

00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:30.570
You'll have this on
problems at number eight.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.170
Because you all now know your
internal radioactivity thanks

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.210
to going to environmental
health and safety.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.750
Did anyone see anything
disconcerting in your spectra,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.350
other than a tiny
little potassium peak?

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.500
Anyone?

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.600
I'd say, ah, it's too bad.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.750
But that's great, especially
for you guys that work

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.670
at the reactor.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.415
Medical X-rays.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.790
It's assumed that everyone
gets a couple of these a year.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.240
You all go to the dentist
and look for cavities.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.660
You break something, you may get
an X-ray of your hand or foot.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.940
And this is let's say an average
amount of medical X-rays.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.070
Then a little bit of stuff
leftover, consumer products.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.470
This isn't counting
things like Fiestaware,

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.690
those orange glazed
plates and bowls

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.770
that were painted with a
uranium based neon orange paint.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.270
So we also don't tend to
drink from Revigators anymore.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.878
Has anyone ever seen or
heard of a Revigator?

00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:27.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, was this
in the '50s or '60s?

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.360
MICHAEL SHORT: Or
even earlier, yeah.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.400
So back in the
'20s, people would

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.580
put radium ore in these
containers and pour water in it

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.620
and say, natural
radioactivity gets in.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:43.040
It cures croup or the Jimmy
legs or astigmatoid rheumatism,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.460
or whatever other quack
diseases there were in the '20s.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.130
You can still find them
on eBay, and that's not

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.730
accounted for in today's
consumer products.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.975
But this all accumulates
the amount of dose

00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:56.350
that you tend to
get on your own.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.810
You might get a couple of
millisieverts a year of dose

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.160
just from background, especially
depending on where you are.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.210
And the big one--

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.850
whose spectrum I think you're
all familiar with by now--

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.110
is that of radon.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.910
Because we saw most of
these peaks in the bananas.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.450
Anyone have any idea why you
would find so many radon decay

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.800
products in bananas?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.360
Given that radon's
everywhere, we

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.190
did notice elevated levels
of specifically bismuth 214

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.810
and actinium I think 228
was the isotope we saw.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.420
Where would those come from?

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.920
The what?

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.880
AUDIENCE: The soil.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Absolutely, yeah.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.147
Whatever radium's coming
out from the bedrock,

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:42.250
that radon has to come
up through the soil.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.530
If that happens to
decay in the soil,

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.990
it makes lead,
bismuth, polonium,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.560
other heavy metals that are
taken by the plant's tissues.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.320
In addition, radon
daughter products

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.257
can plate out on the
leaves themselves.

00:15:56.257 --> 00:15:58.090
So this is one of those
reasons that smoking

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.160
is such a bad thing to do.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.200
Aside from the
chemical effects, you

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.140
have giant fields of
high surface area tobacco

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.250
that you then
concentrate and dry up

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.500
into these tiny little sticks.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.230
You have an enormous
amount of leaf surface area

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.530
and dry vegetation that has
taken all these radon daughter

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.430
products.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.740
So most the dose
you get from smoking

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.040
is lead, bismuth,
polonium, actinium, radium.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.360
Alpha emitters.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.360
As we saw last
time, to remind you

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:31.030
guys of the quality factor
for alpha particles,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.050
it's as big as it gets.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.250
Anyone remember why that is?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.210
Why are alphas so damaging if
they get into your tissues?

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.583
AUDIENCE: Because they're big.

00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:44.750
MICHAEL SHORT: They are
big, so they have high mass.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.450
And?

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.370
AUDIENCE: Short range.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.745
MICHAEL SHORT:
Short range coming

00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:50.780
from their high relative charge.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.820
They have quite
high stopping power.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.770
And they will deposit
a lot of energy

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.240
very close to where
they are emitted.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.460
So their range is very small.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.233
So that armor piercing
bullet analogy

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:03.650
comes to just an armor piercing
bullet that explodes right

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.420
out of the barrel of the gun.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.190
And they do quite a bit
of radiation damage.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.449
We jump back to the right slide
without inducing a seizure.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.500
I think we've looked before
at the radon decay chain.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.300
This is a simplified
version, because there

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.640
are different branches or
different possibilities

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.849
for decay, but some of them
have extremely low percentages.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.950
So this one's
simplified quite a bit.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.670
But it is whenever radon
decays, it gives off

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.170
a bunch of alpha
and beta emitters

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.970
that last anywhere from minutes
or seconds to days and so.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.220
For every radon atom
that you absorb,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.740
you end up getting four
or five alphas and betas,

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.680
depending on how long it
stays into your system.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.520
And then mapping
out radon in the US.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.420
You have quite different
amount of radon dose

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.380
depending on where you are.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.170
And I wanted to skip
ahead and overlay

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.420
a couple of maps of the US.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.630
So this is a terrestrial--

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.770
oh, I'm sorry,
that's the wrong one.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.260
Let's just look
at this one, yeah.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.700
Anyone notice any patterns here?

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.590
Where do you tend to
get the most radon?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.070
What sort of features
would one live near when

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.656
you get a lot of radon dose?

00:18:16.656 --> 00:18:17.600
AUDIENCE: Mountains.

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.910
MICHAEL SHORT: Mountains,
which tend to be made of?

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.577
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:18:22.577 --> 00:18:27.010
MICHAEL SHORT: Rocks, which
tend to contain a lot of radium.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.080
Especially granite
and other such rocks.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.430
The Conway granite, named after
up in Conway, New Hampshire,

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.780
is about 52 parts per
million uranium or radium.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.550
So it's a fairly toasty rock.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.150
You can actually tell there
with your Geiger counter,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.100
if its count long
enough, that there

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.060
is a little bit of radioactive
ore in that Conway granite.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.870
Not nearly enough
to matter at all,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.453
and certainly not enough to stop
you from making fancy kitchen

00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:54.238
countertops.

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:55.780
But I wonder if
folks would buy those

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.990
if they knew that there was 52
parts per million of something

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.630
with a half life
of 9 billion years.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.863
I somehow think it
would matter to people,

00:19:03.863 --> 00:19:04.780
but it really doesn't.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.930
AUDIENCE: They put the radiation
symbol on it [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.933
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yes, engrave that.

00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:12.100
If they made the radiation
symbol a little induction

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.200
stove, that would
be pretty slick.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.640
Yeah.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.600
And then in terms of
relative radon risk,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.910
how much actually matters?

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.900
I like this graph.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.600
Despite being difficult
to read, it actually

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.330
shows how much the
average indoor level

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
compares to all the different
things you could do.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.890
Like getting 2,000 chest X-rays
per year versus 100 times

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.970
the average indoor level.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.280
That's about what I heard
that fellow in Pennsylvania

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520
had is like 100 or 80
times the normal radon

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.200
levels from living underground
on this giant granite deposit.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.080
It's like getting 2,000
chest X-rays per year,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.230
or something like
smoking four packs a day.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.620
I know some people that do this.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.990
They don't tend to be that
afraid of the radiation

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.290
that they're taking
in from smoking.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:04.200
But yeah, it's pretty insane
how much radiation you get.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.720
People are afraid to get one
chest X-ray, which is not even

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.280
on this map.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.590
One chest X-ray
worth of radiation

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.880
gives you much, much less than
living for a year in a house,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.577
which we all tend to do.

00:20:16.577 --> 00:20:18.660
Then if you live in a brick
or cinder block house,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.730
you actually get a fair
bit more radiation,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.460
because these are fairly
radioactive building materials.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.020
And I'll show you those
activity levels in just a sec.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.670
As far as exposure
sources, again,

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.850
to look at the relative amount
of terrestrial gamma ray

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.240
exposure, you can
correlate that pretty well

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.920
with not green regions
on a topological map.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.860
So look at the really
low levels down here,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.810
correlates with low lying
vegetative areas around here.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.660
Colors are a little more
extreme on my screen,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.820
but you can see this is
all low lying right here.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.670
From Louisiana, Florida,
up the east coast,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.910
until you get to the
Appalachian Mountains and such.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.250
So pretty striking
correlations there.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.310
And it all comes from what we
call the primordial nuclides.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.760
These are unstable nuclides
that have such long half

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.100
lives that they still
exist, despite the universe

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.220
being 15 billion years
old, or whatever supernova

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.690
formed our solar system being
five plus billion years old.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.090
Things that we've already
studied almost to death,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.190
like potassium-40.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.750
And you can see that's about
0.011% of all potassium

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.940
is radioactive potassium-40.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.600
About 10% of which
gives off gammas in--

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.650
what is it, 90/10?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.000
I forget the split.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.460
But can give off either
betas and then a gamma,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.860
or positrons and then a gamma.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.860
Then things like rubidium,
in the same column

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.250
as sodium, potassium, and
cesium, so it behaves kind

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.220
of like a salt-like element.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.610
There should be some for-- are
there any for chlorine too?

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.070
Some of the other important
ones to note, oh, platinum.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.877
Does anyone has any
platinum jewelry?

00:21:59.877 --> 00:22:01.460
Does anyone have any
platinum jewelry?

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.950
Good answer, yeah.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.850
I don't either.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.070
I teach at a college.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.710
Also, I don't like
wearing jewelry.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.110
But there'll be all sorts
of these primordial nuclides

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.850
that you can't really
do anything about.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.030
They're just there.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.510
Note that the half lives
are really, really long.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.010
And as you know
now, the half life

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.100
is going to be inversely
proportional to the activity.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.050
Despite almost all indium--

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.210
look at that, 95% of the indium
that you'll find emits betas.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.880
Doesn't stop people from using
it as these awesome glass

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.278
to metal seals for
vacuum components.

00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:38.320
Because once in a while
it might emit a beta ray,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.440
like a whole gasket
might emit a beta once

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.270
every millennium or so.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.920
But these half lives
actually are measurable.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.880
And that begs the question,
are there elements

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.960
with longer half lives that
are just too long to measure?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.580
You think what does it mean
to have a half life of 10

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.260
to the 15 years, given that the
universe is on the order of 10

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.470
to the 10 years old?

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.600
Is it possible that
all nuclei will

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.330
decay till the end of time?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.160
I've seen some
documentary such things

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.770
and don't call this a science
that say, oh 10 to the 40 years

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.840
from now, the last
protons decay,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.810
or the last whatever
elements decay

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.490
into all protons and neutrons.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.220
Don't know if
that's true, but it

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.460
does make me wonder, are some
of the other so-called stable

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.670
elements just have
ridiculously long half lives?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.268
It's something to think about.

00:23:31.268 --> 00:23:33.640
So let's take a look at
the building materials,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.150
and see what's in the typical
things around us right now.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.120
You can see how much
granite, radioactive thorium,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.550
and potassium are in
these building materials.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.410
And how many usually is
measured in picocuries per gram.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.870
A picocurie is already less
than a becquerel per gram.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:57.000
Because a curie is what, 3.7
times 10 to the 10 becquerels.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.720
And a pico is a 10
to the minus 12.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.180
So things on the order of
a few picocuries per gram,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.690
a gram of that
material might emit

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.360
one disintegration per second.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.100
Not a lot of radiation.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.920
But take a look at how much
potassium there is in granite.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.060
Nanocuries per gram, that's
getting into the integers

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.130
worth of becquerels.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.620
If you look at wood,
check that out.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.844
Anyone heard of potash before?

00:24:25.844 --> 00:24:27.830
It's one of the ways
we get potassium.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.180
So if you take wood based things
and you burn them in a fire,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.130
you drive off all the
carbon in the water,

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.460
you're left with these kind of
whitened salt and pepper ashes.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.390
That's potash.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.040
That's the ashes
left over in the pot

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.332
after you burn stuff in a fire.

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:42.202
They're quite potassium rich.

00:24:42.202 --> 00:24:43.660
So I think what
we'll do next year,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.662
instead of burning
a bunch of food,

00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:46.870
is just burn a bunch of wood.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.290
We'll have a nice bonfire,
collect the ashes.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.080
And we can see how much
potassium there is in wood.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.270
Which pound for pound,
if you see on this list,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.390
is the most radioactive
building material there is.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.270
Just that wood happens
to be pretty inexpensive,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.050
and consists mostly of water,
lignin, and other carboniferous

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.340
materials.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.200
They don't have
carbon-14 on this list,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.200
but let's take a look at
some of the other ones.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.560
So sandstone cement has a
pretty toasty signature to it.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.500
Gypsum drywall.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.470
What is it, 13 parts per million
uranium in all the drywall

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.830
you tend to find.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.075
Anyone scared yet?

00:25:24.075 --> 00:25:26.140
Because you shouldn't be.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.970
It's like I mentioned
before, this

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.220
is the slide I want
to show to most folks

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.050
in the general public.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.660
There is such a dose as nothing.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.830
And that's pretty much
what you get from,

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.440
let's say, a day's worth of
being around these building

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:39.890
materials.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.890
It's just about nothing.

00:25:44.522 --> 00:25:48.200
It's after the
building materials.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.470
There we go.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.150
Seawater is another great
source of radioactivity.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.410
Enough so that
people have actually

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:03.125
proposed harvesting
uranium from seawater.

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:05.000
So the total amount of
activity in the ocean,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.140
there's something
like 11 exabecquerels

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.440
of radiation contained in
the uranium in the seawater.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.220
Which means you should be able
to have a gigantic trawler

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.208
flying out around in the
ocean, and just floating

00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:22.250
through the seawater,
picking up atoms of uranium

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.670
here and there.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.503
Because technically,
there's enough to power

00:26:24.503 --> 00:26:26.300
the world for like 2,000 years.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.410
The problem is the ocean is big.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.920
It doesn't stop people from
actually working on it.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.337
So it's neat to
think that there's

00:26:32.337 --> 00:26:34.430
a whole lot of
carbon-14 and tritium

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.650
and uranium in seawater.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.690
300 picocuries per liter.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.598
Anyone have any idea why there's
so much more potassium activity

00:26:42.598 --> 00:26:43.890
than anything else in seawater?

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.330
It's because it's salty, yeah.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.950
And potassium's
just like sodium.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.380
So there'll be a
fair bit of potassium

00:26:53.380 --> 00:27:00.300
in the seawater, 0.0117%
of which is potassium-40.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.030
And so last year, people asked,
what, uranium from seawater?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.360
How is that even possible?

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.090
So this is the part
in the course where

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.250
I'm going to pull out a
lot more recent papers

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.920
to show you some of the
cooler innovations going on.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.290
So you could use this adsorbent.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.000
And adsorbent.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.060
Does anyone know what adsorption
means, not absorption?

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.890
Adsorption is when
something sticks

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.630
to the surface of something.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.880
Absorption with a B is
when it actually gets

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.950
incorporated into the bulk.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.500
So folks are thinking about
making high surface area

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.280
materials that can adsorb
selectively atoms of uranium.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.560
So you send out this huge
braided net, or a huge stack

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.240
of adsorbing material with
a D, and just go around

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.590
in the ocean.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.440
Attach them to tankers
or cargo ships,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.810
and just have them
pull in product

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.150
as they go from coast to coast.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.180
And by actually changing around
the chemistry and the geometry

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.300
of this, you can enhance
things specifically for uranium

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.830
by about a factor of three.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.800
And this yellowcake right
here next to an actual ruler--

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.930
that's 50 millimeters
right there--

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.600
that was obtained
directly from seawater.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.938
So you can actually pull
yellowcake out of the ocean.

00:28:11.938 --> 00:28:12.980
Just not very much of it.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.810
And the way these work is there
are interesting compounds that

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.530
selectively absorb uranium
into their structure,

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.990
not by direct chemical bonding,
but by getting something close.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.990
For example, my wife tends
to study metals bonding

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.740
to proteins.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.488
And it's not necessarily
always a full chemical bond

00:28:34.488 --> 00:28:36.030
like you might think,
but the protein

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.570
can kind of wrap around a
metal ion, transport it places.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.530
Similar thing going here.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.590
I'm not going to
pontificate anymore

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.200
on it because the title
has the word organic in it,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.380
and I am definitely
not an organic chemist.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.963
Don't want to tell
you anything wrong,

00:28:49.963 --> 00:28:52.583
but I do want to tell you you
can actually see this paper

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:54.000
to find out what
sort of compounds

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.958
selectively grab onto uranium.

00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:57.750
And if there's a seawater
floating through,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.200
and uranium happens to flow
nearby, it can bond to it.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.040
You can then somehow squeeze
out or burn off that adsorbent,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.535
and there you get uranium.

00:29:07.535 --> 00:29:09.160
Now let's talk about
what's in the body

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.720
and interpreting the spectra
that you got from EHS,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.270
your full body spectra.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.870
If you take a look
at how much uranium

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.030
there is in the body,
wow, there's some.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.330
Every one of you is got
about a becquerel of uranium

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.480
in the body.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.080
But if you look at the relative
amounts, rate it was at.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.870
The only things that
really matter a ton,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:34.580
potassium-40, about 4.4
kilobecquerels per human.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.490
So each of you is giving
off 4,400 potassium gammas

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.080
per second.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.770
Most of them just flow right
through all the other people.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:48.183
And then carbon-14,
about 3.7 kilobecquerels.

00:29:48.183 --> 00:29:50.600
Pretty interesting to know
just how much radioactive stuff

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.070
you have in your own body.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.310
You will need this table
for homework number eight

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.220
when I ask you a
pretty fun question.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.770
Then there's all the
various medical procedures.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.920
The ones that aren't counted in
your annual dose because they

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.630
tend to save people.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.880
But now let's look at
the dose in millirem

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.520
So if you want to figure out
what this is in sieverts,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.720
just divide by 100.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.880
So a regular old
chest X-ray, 0.1--

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.620
let's see, how does it go?

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.070
100 rem in a sievert.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.610
Yeah, so about 0.1
millisieverts, or 1,000 banana

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.300
equivalent dose.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.620
Not terrible.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.350
Which is why if we go
back to that chart of all

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.420
those relative
risks, if you look

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.510
at the average indoor level,
it's like getting-- well,

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.900
I would have to guess maybe
40 chest X-rays per year

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.932
based on this
rather crude scale.

00:30:44.932 --> 00:30:46.890
And you're allowed to
get around a millisievert

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.440
or a few millisieverts
of radiation per year.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.641
That sounds like it
checks out mathematically.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.540
Let's look at some of
the other crazier ones.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.070
Dental bitewing.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.640
Yeah.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.890
So anyone ever bite
down on something

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.980
where you have to get an X-ray
through the side of your mouth?

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.040
Quite negligible amount
of dose, yet they still

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.630
put the lead apron on you.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.720
I'm guessing that's mostly
for show, because that's

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.920
very, very little dose.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.350
It's well beyond the 0.1
microsieverts of something

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.000
that counts as nothing.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.770
But there's not a lot of
dose going into these things.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.390
Let's see what really does
give you a whole lot of dose.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:34.030
10 millisieverts for a CT scan,
or a whole body CT screening.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.190
That's a pretty
hefty amount of dose.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.290
Right there with
one procedure you

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.772
may get more than your normal
annual background dose.

00:31:41.772 --> 00:31:43.480
But if you're going
in to look for stuff,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.270
chances are you need to find
whatever you're looking for.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.200
So we don't count it.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.560
And it may give you a
slightly higher chance

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.140
of developing cancer
much later down the line

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.572
when that cell that
gets mutated divides.

00:31:55.572 --> 00:31:58.030
But it's probably going to save
your life in the next hour,

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.270
or the next day.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.550
So definitely worth it.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.930
Let's see, the worst--

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.820
what's the worst
procedure we can find?

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.200
Noncardiac embolization.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.650
I don't know enough
biology words

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.866
know exactly what that means.

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:18.210
AUDIENCE: I know what
noncardiac means.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.990
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, I think we
all know what noncardiac means.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.690
Good.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.960
This isn't 7012.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.110
Nonmedical procedures-- or more
medical procedures, I'm sorry.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.700
Where's the techneitum scan?

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.590
Yeah, notice how
many of these things

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.830
have technetium imaging where
you'll inject technetium

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.430
into a certain organ or a
certain vascular or lymph

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.940
or whatever system.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.240
Some of these things can
give you a fair bit of dose.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.570
Like again, maybe a
heart stress rest test

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.600
can give you double or triple
your normal background dose.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.060
This is why you have
to declare to airports

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.310
if you've just had a
medical imaging procedure,

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.830
because this is well more
than enough to pick up

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.575
on any sort of airport
radiation monitor.

00:32:59.575 --> 00:33:01.450
So again, if you ever
get a medical procedure

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.730
with any sort of
radiation, anything,

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:08.260
do declare it, because
it's quite measurable.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.390
Then there's radiation
from altitude.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.210
I may have mentioned already
that the reason that pilots

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.810
can't fly for a certain number
of hours is not fatigue,

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.940
but it's radiation exposure.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.400
When you start to
look at how many

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.750
microsieverts you get per
hour on the ground, 0.03.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.270
Right about down at that--
hanging around for an hour

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.950
is a negligible dose.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.440
You go up to
international air travel,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.950
that goes up by a factor
of little more than 100.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.310
And so you get a fair bit
of radiation exposure.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.160
If you take your annual
allowable occupational

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.160
limit of 50 millisieverts,
divide by 3.7 microsieverts,

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.650
you're getting close to 86--

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.150
what is it?

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.948
How many hours in a year?

00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:52.970
Let's see.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.860
There's three times 10 of
the seven seconds in a year.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.640
So divide that by 3,600.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.680
That's getting on
the realm of 10,000.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.690
That's about the
conversion factor.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.403
So you can't spend
your life in the air,

00:34:03.403 --> 00:34:05.320
because you'd get too
much radiation according

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.480
to the occupational risks.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.552
And so actually in addition to
some interesting measurements

00:34:12.552 --> 00:34:14.010
that have been
published in papers,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.719
we've actually had
students go out

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:20.250
and build radiation altimeters
based on the MIT Geiger

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.179
counter--

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.012
removing the speaker,
of course, because you

00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:25.090
don't want to clicking
Geiger counter on a plane.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.480
That'd be kind of a
stressful situation.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.340
Let me show you one
example of these.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.670
Are also published from a paper,
but we have pretty similar data

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.130
from-- if you want, to
go talk to Max Carlson,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.179
one of my graduate students who
hooked up his Geiger counter

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.370
to an alarm clock--

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.560
the case that had
[INAUDIBLE] in it.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.130
I think this was a poor
choice of case for a plane

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.920
because it looks kind
of like a time bomb.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.270
But luckily nobody found it,
and he was able to get the data.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.280
But you can see just how
much more data you get.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.700
And you can correlate the height
that you're at with the dose--

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:05.950
in this case, microroentgens per
hour or microrad depending on--

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:10.180
what is it-- ambiguous unit
definition right there.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.590
But it's quite noticeable.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.690
So for those of you who
have built Geiger counters

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.230
and have cell phones, and don't
want to have a fake time bomb,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.390
you can actually hook
in your Geiger counter

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.330
to the microphone port
of your cell phone.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.230
And with a few available
radiation apps,

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.220
you can actually monitor
your dose in microsieverts.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.710
Assuming that it all comes
from gamma rays, which

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.880
is most of what a lot of
cosmic rays will produce.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.430
So it's a pretty
safe approximation

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.650
that your dose in gray
flying on the plane

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.600
is also your dose in
sieverts, because it's

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.933
whole body, and its gammas.

00:35:39.933 --> 00:35:41.350
So I'd say try
this at home, kids.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:46.130
This is one of those things
I recommend you try out.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.830
Speaking of these cosmic rays,
where did they come from?

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.220
Well, this is a question
that's been under debate,

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.910
and was more completely
answered just a few years ago.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.330
They come from very high energy
particles from somewhere.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.060
It had been argued, do they
come mostly from solar flares,

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.480
or did they come from
elsewhere in the galaxy?

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.810
Mostly we're talking about
things like high energy protons

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.640
or other charged particles.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.710
We're also talking neutrinos.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.330
Anyone know about
how many neutrinos

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:18.790
are theorized to pass
through you every second?

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.690
Trillions.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.110
Yeah, something like that.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.800
But they basically don't
interact with matter.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.760
As I showed you guys
near the beginning,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.710
it takes a gigantic salt mine
full of water and exploding

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.250
photomultiplier tubes in order
to catch two or three neutrinos

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:34.330
a day if you're lucky.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.430
So let's say those
don't really matter

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.020
in terms of background dose.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.218
But when those high
energy particles interact

00:36:41.218 --> 00:36:43.510
with the oxygen and nitrogen
up here in the atmosphere,

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.030
they produce a
shower and cascade

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.850
of additional ionization
and high energy particles.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.870
So it's been said that solar
flares and such will accelerate

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.210
charged particles
from the plasma

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.890
in the sun towards Earth.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.100
They're deflected somewhat
by the magnetic field

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.510
of the Earth, but they
tend to enter right here

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.250
at the-- what is it?

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.070
At the poles.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.210
I'm sorry, that's the simple
word I was looking for.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:16.820
Until recently in 2001, they
were looking specifically

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.910
at the evidence for or against
the idea that coronal mass

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.820
ejections-- which means
large ejections of mass from

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.760
the outer layers, these
sparcer layers of the sun--

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.080
was responsible for most charged
particles and cosmic rays.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.110
Skipping the stuff
that's not in bold,

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.970
it appears to be that
the CME bow shock

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.250
scenario has been overvalued.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.720
So for a while,
folks were saying

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.020
most cosmic rays come from the
sun-- that's our nearest star.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.250
By making really, really careful
measurements of the energy

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.690
and lifetime of
these cosmic rays,

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.970
this has actually been
somewhat disproven

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.970
that this is the major
source of cosmic rays, which

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.810
is pretty cool.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.560
But let's talk about where
they actually come from.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.530
Reactions that you can
probably understand.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.290
So extremely high protons
enter the atmosphere.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.660
They all start as
high energy protons.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.150
And when protons are
high enough energy--

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.430
and like I do probably
in every class ever,

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.900
I'm going to pull up Janis
to show you something.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.690
They can undergo what's
called spallation.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.570
It's the same principle
that the Spallation Neutron

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.910
Source at Oak Ridge
National Lab works on

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.610
is shoot in extremely
high energy protons,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.690
out come neutrons.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.370
So as usual, it didn't
clone the screen right.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.690
So just bear with me for a sec.

00:38:36.557 --> 00:38:38.890
I'd like to, for probably the
first time in this course,

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.425
switch databases to the
incident proton data.

00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:43.512
Is that actually working?

00:38:43.512 --> 00:38:44.456
OK, good.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.710
So we'll leave the
incident neutron data,

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:54.270
we'll go to the
incident proton data.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.920
We'll stick with
the same library.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.360
Let's see how much they have.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.880
Not much, but enough to
matter, because there's

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.240
a lot of nitrogen-14
up in the air.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.930
Let's see what happens when
protons hit nitrogen-14

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.180
all the way at high energy.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.910
So don't quite know what a
negative cross-section refers

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:17.410
to.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.190
But at high energies, this is
definitely a possible event.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.540
And let's see, there's not
a lot of cross-sections

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.160
to look at here.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.670
Let's try oxygen-16.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.620
Not much.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.760
We'll stick to the slides then.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.520
So when a high energy
proton strikes a nucleus,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.290
it can eject neutrons.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:41.790
And those neutrons can then
cause activation reactions,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.820
and then emit things like
proton or tritium, leading to--

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.100
that's where your
carbon-14 comes from.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.110
Comes from nitrogen-14.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.350
So in comes a high energy
proton, releases a neutron.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:56.550
That neutron hits nitrogen-14,
releases a proton,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.630
out comes carbon-14.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.170
So this is why it's being
constantly generated

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.020
in the atmosphere.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.812
It's not like there's
a certain amount that

00:40:03.812 --> 00:40:06.270
was there at the beginning
of the universe and decays,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.150
because its half life
is only 5,700 years.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.370
So this is part of why
radiocarbon dating works,

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.615
because we have cosmic rays.

00:40:13.615 --> 00:40:15.240
It's kind of a neat
connection to make.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.323
If there weren't cosmic
rays, all of the carbon-14

00:40:17.323 --> 00:40:21.720
would decay pretty quickly
in the universe time scale.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.350
And we wouldn't have this
form of radiocarbon dating.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.320
And then same thing for tritium
production in the atmosphere.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.830
This is where some of that
tritium naturally comes from,

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.530
is it makes carbon-12-- which
is the normal form of carbon--

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.080
but out come tritium,
which there is going

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.750
to be some constant isotopic
fraction of tritium in all

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.760
the world's hydrogen.
Some of it's being

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.670
generated in real time.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.860
And we do have these
spallation sources on Earth.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.500
Like I mentioned, the
Spallation Neutron Source

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.570
has a gigantic synchrotron.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.930
We've seen these before, which
just injects in this case

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:58.100
protons, which circle around and
around and around, accelerating

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:02.570
until some of them are
extracted and fire onto things

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.740
like a liquid mercury target,
some neutron rich liquid metal.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.050
So you want something
that's very neutron rich.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.970
You want something
that's very dense.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.670
You want something that's fluid
so you can cool it better.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.070
And you want something with
high thermal conductivity.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.990
That's where the metal comes in.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.420
So a liquid metal you can
keep cool really well.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.900
Because when you're firing lots
of 800 MeV protons into it,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.795
you generate a tremendous
amount of heat.

00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:28.670
And this is what the
actual thing looks like.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.980
You can get tours of
this down in Tennessee

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.948
at the Oak Ridge National Lab.

00:41:32.948 --> 00:41:34.490
Actually, I've driven
up here before.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.350
I recognize this from the map.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.680
That's pretty cool.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.560
So where the actual
neutron science stuff

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.580
happens, where all
the scientists sit

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.580
with their targets, there's
quite a bit of stuff

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.050
going on behind it.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.910
So there is a gigantic--

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.960
you can see that's a
parking lot for scale.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.420
There's a gigantic
linear accelerator

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.090
shooting into the
synchrotron ring, which

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.130
then fires the protons
here into the target

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.720
into one of any number of end
stations, which creates a not

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.230
quite push button, but
turn on-able pulsed neutron

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.220
source, which is pretty slick.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.880
And again, parking
lot for scale.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.410
Takes a lot of magnets to
bend an 800 MeV proton.

00:42:16.722 --> 00:42:18.180
That's what it
actually looks like.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.670
Has anyone ever seen one
of these synchrotrons?

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.525
Like at Brookhaven or at
Oak Ridge or at anywhere?

00:42:24.525 --> 00:42:25.900
They're quite
interesting things.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.570
The closest one
to us is the NSLS,

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.700
or the National Synchrotron
Light Source version

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.620
two at Brookhaven National Lab.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.973
It's like a 2 and 1/2 hour
drive down in Long Island.

00:42:34.973 --> 00:42:36.640
I don't know if they're
doing tours yet,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.770
but it's about a
kilometer around.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.780
And I was told they did
bike races around it

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.447
to see who could beat
the protons, which

00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:44.920
of course everybody loses.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.200
But they are pretty
insane collections

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.970
of magnets, vacuum equipment.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.140
And once in a while a
proton will pass through.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.177
And then there's the
spallation source itself.

00:42:55.177 --> 00:42:56.760
So this is what the
target looks like.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.040
There's going to have to
be liquid metal cooled in.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.892
And then out of here come lots
and lots and lots of neutrons.

00:43:02.892 --> 00:43:04.350
Enough neutrons
that you still need

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.640
hot cells to deal with things.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.630
They're still quite
radioactive, inactivated.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:08.970
But it's not a reactor.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.220
Other ways of making neutrons.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.470
Speaking of, has anybody
seen the pulsed fusion source

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:18.240
that we have down
in Northwest 13?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.870
No?

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.880
We have a pulse
neutron source that you

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.400
can come take a look at.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.133
It's an electrostatic
fusion pulsed machine.

00:43:26.133 --> 00:43:28.050
There's a whole bunch
of tritium and deuterium

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.440
in this palladium sponge,
what happens to hold hydrogen

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.450
and its isotopes very well.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.240
And with a very quick pulse,
you can have a tiny pulse fusion

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.180
and generate about 10 to the
8th neutrons that actually is

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.100
a push button neutron source.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.980
So if you want to see a
neutron source beyond reactors,

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.510
go down to the vault
in Northwest 13

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.070
and ask to see that.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.780
We did a quick
experiment before trying

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.510
to activate cell phones
to see what was in them.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.030
We did not generate
enough neutrons to do so.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.400
But this cell phone has
definitely seen a few fusion

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.842
neutron pulses.

00:43:57.842 --> 00:43:59.550
And we checked later,
it's not giving off

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.200
any residual radioactivity.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.200
At least we can measure.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.802
That was a fun
failed experiment.

00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:07.010
And then comes the craziness.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.650
Since it's about five
of, I want to get

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.450
into things that will
definitely not be on the exam.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.590
So just sit back and enjoy
and stop taking notes.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:18.740
Complete insanity can happen
with super high energy

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.890
electrons.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.520
We've already talked
about Bremsstrahlung.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.220
We have talked about
synchrotron radiation, where

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.170
you have a charged particle
going along a magnetic field

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:29.670
line.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.190
It changes direction
and gives off X-rays.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:37.660
We haven't talked about
inverse Compton scattering.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.465
Interesting process here.

00:44:40.465 --> 00:44:43.550
In comes a low energy
photon, hits an electron,

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:47.090
out comes a higher
energy photon.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.340
Compton scatterings usually
think of as the other way

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.330
around, where a high energy
photon comes in, scatters off

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.880
an electron, loses energy.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.190
In this case, a
high energy electron

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.410
colliding with a
low energy photon

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.858
can impart energy to the photon.

00:45:04.858 --> 00:45:06.900
And you can actually
calculate-- or in this case,

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.600
I've just taken from a paper--

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.140
the energy gain from
inverse Compton scattering,

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.410
as well as whatever
cross-section there is.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.020
And even though this is a
very infrequent process--

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.825
well, the universe
is pretty big,

00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:21.200
and contains a
lot of things that

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.320
have magnetic fields
like stars and black--

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.880
whatever else happens
to have magnetic fields.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.630
And you can identify
radio sources

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.050
by looking for these inverse
Compton scattered X-rays.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.030
So the Chandra X-ray map,
I believe a piece of which

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:40.190
or a receiver for which is up in
the building in Porter Square.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.930
If you guys go down three
stops on the red line,

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.530
you'll see this little area
full of Japanese noodle

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.197
shops, Lesley University,
a bunch of galleries.

00:45:48.197 --> 00:45:48.905
And in a little--

00:45:51.742 --> 00:45:54.200
I think it's still there-- and
a little sign that says, oh,

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.080
and there's the Chandra
X-ray Observatory.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:57.668
Whatever.

00:45:57.668 --> 00:45:59.210
They may or may not
have moved, but I

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.430
recommend you check it out.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.570
And then what happens
to those electrons?

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.180
Well, they can actually decay.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.840
Pretty interesting things.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.080
And so some of this
inverse Compton scattering

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.080
has gone into the evidence
for or against where

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.690
cosmic rays come from,
because you should

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.080
see electrons of
a certain energy

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.925
after undergoing this process.

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.020
I think I will skip ahead.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.530
Oh, I won't skip ahead.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.010
And so what these
cosmic rays can produce

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.190
is what's called positive,
negative, or neutral pions.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.860
Other subatomic particles
with masses somewhere

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.860
between protons and
electrons that themselves

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.440
can undergo different reactions
or different decays into muons.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.170
And don't worry, muons
and pions and such

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.270
are not part of the
topic of this course.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.640
But they do have
known lifetimes,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.782
they do have known
masses and charges,

00:46:52.782 --> 00:46:54.240
they do have known
stopping powers.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.040
We should be able
to measure them.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.160
And there is a cosmic muon
detector at Boston University.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.290
Or rather, it's a
pair of detectors

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.690
that looks for this
coincidence of one muon

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:06.150
scattering off one
detector, or interacting,

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.970
and another particle being
sensed directly beneath.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.503
So we can actually sense these
muons to confirm or refute

00:47:12.503 --> 00:47:13.920
the theories about
where they come

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.140
from in terms of cosmic rays.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.830
And these neutral
pions are what end

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.840
up creating these gamma rays.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.570
I think they were around
the 70 something MeV range.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.540
So if these theories
about them are correct,

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.730
we should be able to
sense these gamma rays,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.700
and sense how many of them there
are as a function of energy.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.810
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.600
Let me recreate
presentation mode,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.840
because this is definitely
delving into the kind of stuff

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.310
that, well, I'm
not an expert in.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.870
So a quick detour into
subatomic physics.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.570
You guys probably have heard of
that protons and neutrons are

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.880
not the smallest building
blocks of matter.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.330
They themselves can be composed
of quarks and antiquarks

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.910
with different charges
and different masses.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.560
They're given different flavors.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.780
I don't know who came up
with this terminology,

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.430
but it's kind of fun.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.170
Things get kind
of whimsical when

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.420
you get into subatomic physics.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.290
And these quarks and
the gluons between them

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:20.230
are what composes protons,
neutrons, in their antimatter

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.100
counterparts.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.550
And these sorts of things can
also undergo their own decay

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:27.340
and reactions.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.480
So when beta decay
occurs, it's actually

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.000
one of these up quarks
turning into a down quark

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.360
and releasing an electron
and an antineutrino.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.050
But again, we're not going to
delve even deeper into this.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.080
There are other particles
composed of other arrangements

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.380
of quarks.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.780
So if you have just an up and a
down, you have a positive pion.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.020
Which should have a charge--

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.580
I think one's 2/3
of one's minus 1/3.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.990
Yep, that is correct.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:58.800
So a plus pion should
have a charge of 1/3

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.420
the charge of an electron.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.370
So if you know the
mass of some particle

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.260
because you know the
number of quarks,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.090
and you know the
charge of it, you

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.873
should be able to calculate
its own stopping power.

00:49:08.873 --> 00:49:10.290
And figure out how
many should get

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.270
through the atmosphere
and such, or how many

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.800
get absorbed in your detector.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.310
And so when a very high
energy proton collides

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.070
with an atmospheric molecule,
it creates neutrons,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.140
creates a shower of pions.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.400
These neutral pions-- much like
electron positron interaction--

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.130
can produce their own gammas.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.400
So they can spontaneously
decay from particles

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.450
that are mass into gamma
rays of pure energy.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.140
Which then go on to create
their own shower of electrons

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.420
and positrons by
pair production.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.540
Because as we saw, the higher
in energy you go for photons,

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.120
the more likely pair
production becomes.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.660
And there you have it.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.820
This is part of the 22.01 stuff,
but taken to the nth degree.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.460
And then the evidence
for pion decay

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.670
comes from extremely
fine measurements

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.660
of the number of these pions
as a function of energy.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.910
Or in this case, look at that.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.110
They're-- what is it-- ergs per
centimeter squared per second.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.765
What does that unit
physically mean?

00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:13.250
Not going to get into that.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.120
But at any rate, there
are different models

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.050
for how many of these pions
or their high energy gamma

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.085
decay products
should be observed.

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.710
And by looking at
those very carefully,

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.710
you can tell where
they came from.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.680
Should they have come from
coronal mass discharges,

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.930
so we should know what energy
those protons should be,

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.675
or some other source

00:50:33.675 --> 00:50:36.820
But I am going to stop
there, because it is five of.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.540
So after that crazy detour, give
you guys 10 minutes to degas

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.440
and absorb some neutral
pion gamma decay products.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.910
We'll meet upstairs in 10
minutes for an exam review.

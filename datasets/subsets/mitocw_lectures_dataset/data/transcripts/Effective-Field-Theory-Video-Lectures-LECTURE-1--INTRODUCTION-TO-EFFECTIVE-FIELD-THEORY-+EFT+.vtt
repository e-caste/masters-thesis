00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.900
PROFESSOR: --the
back of the room.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.910
This course is being taped.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.110
It may appear in the
future on EdX or MITx.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.272
It will appear on
OpenCourseWare.

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:32.439
So that means that by just
sitting in the classroom,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.590
you're choosing to participate
in this adventure of having

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.940
the course videotaped.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.340
If you want to hide, you
can sit in the back row.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.892
If you want to be part of the--

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:44.850
if you want to be famous,
sit in the front row.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.910
So I handed out the syllabus.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.100
And I'll just go through
some of the things on here.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800
So as a prerequisite--

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
so at MIT, we have three quantum
field theory courses, 1, 2, 3.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.099
As a prerequisite, I've listed
quantum field theory two.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.770
I don't want to stop people
that are taking quantum field

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.920
theory 3 this term from also
registering for this course.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.020
But some of the things
that you'd usually

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.480
see in quantum
field theory 3 are

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.340
kind of important background
things for this course.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.078
So what I've done is I've posted
on the website for the course

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:24.120
my lecture notes from when
I taught quantum field

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.730
theory 3 last year.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.730
So you can look at that.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.340
And I'll assign some reading
for that as background material

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.410
for this.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.440
Some things actually were
taught in quantum field theory 2

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.600
last term, some things
like, for example,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.828
the beta function of QCD
for normalization group.

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.120
So those things are going to
be important prerequisites

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.770
for this course.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.170
And I'll assign some
background reading

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.900
so that you can remind
yourself about those things.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.900
If you have any concerns
about your preparation,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.390
please feel free to talk to me.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.040
In terms of grading,
this is pretty low key.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.300
We have five problem
sets that will

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.920
be roughly every two weeks.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.120
We won't start the first
problem set until next week.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.979
And then there'll
be a presentation

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.979
at the end of the class.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.520
There's no exams, no tests.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.370
The purpose of the
presentation is basically,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.527
effective field theory
is a very broad topic

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.360
and there's no chance
we'll be able to cover

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.110
every possible thing
about effective field

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.300
theory in this course.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.010
In particular, a
lot of applications

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.610
we'll have to be brief on
or we won't touch on at all.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.080
So if you look at the
syllabus on page three,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.810
there's a list of possible
presentation topics.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.010
Each one of you will pick--

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.900
each one of you that
registers for the course

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.380
and wants to give a presentation
will give a presentation

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.820
at the end on one
of these topics,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.323
prepare it, and stand up
and lecture to the class.

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:46.740
And the idea is
that basically you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.428
will teach the class for
half an hour or so about one

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:50.970
of these topics,
and then that way we

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.500
will broaden the scope of things
that we'll be able to cover.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.430
Even this long list
is not complete.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.740
And you can also pick a
topic that's not on this list

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.790
if you talk to me about it.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.622
So a little later I'll also give
you some suggested references

00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:08.580
for reading about this.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.410
I just, at this point,
give you the list.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.090
And we'll talk about where you
might read about these things

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.590
later on.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.340
I'll give you a more
detailed handout.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.970
So even if you just
look at this list,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.480
you kind of see the breadth
of-- the idea of effective field

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.240
theory, how broadly it impacts
physics, and particle physics,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.230
in particular.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.200
So you know, everything
from finite temperature QCD,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.280
finite density, effective
field theories in inflation,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.215
popular these days.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.840
Effective field
theories of cold atoms,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.810
are also very
popular these days.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.470
Non-relativistic QCD production
of quarkonia, both in medium,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.820
out of medium.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.860
Relativistic super fluids.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.320
Conformal effective
field theories.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320
The list goes on and on.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.120
Lattice effective
field theories.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.650
So it's a very broad topic.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.540
And what I'm going
to do in this course

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.180
is I'm going to start out with
the first half of the course

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.693
teaching you about the ideas
of effective field theory,

00:03:59.693 --> 00:04:01.110
some of the basic
ingredients that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.060
go into all effective
field theories

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.645
and some more technical
things that only show up

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.020
in some effective
field theories,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.702
but that are kind
of providing you

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:10.410
with lessons if you
had to ever construct

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.880
your own effective field theory.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.153
That's the idea of the
first half of the course.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.570
The second half
of the course, I'm

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.862
going to focus on a particular
effective field theory--

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:19.860
soft-colinear effective
field theory, which

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.860
is an effective field theory
that's close to my heart that's

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.350
exciting these days because
of its applications to the jet

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.690
physics in the LHC.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.270
So we'll talk about that as
the second half of the course.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.060
So as I say on the
outline, there's not really

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.330
a textbook for this course.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.830
I suggest some text
that may be useful,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.710
but they're not any
one of them will

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.740
be useful for more than 20%
of the material, many of them

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.640
for less than 10%
of the material.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640
So I don't necessarily
recommend that you go out

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.890
and buy all of them--
or buy any of them.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.040
I will try to post
chapters of things

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.020
on the website when
it's required reading.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.270
And these books will be
available in the reading room,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.580
so you can do it that
way, if you like.

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.100
If you're really serious about
phenomenology, of course,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.392
you should own all these books.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.300
So on the course outline,
I also listed office hours.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.130
And I will adjust those when
I find out all your schedules.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.710
And I also listed
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.760
who's sitting in the back,
is a 10% TA for the course.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.590
He'll be doing some
grading for us.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.715
He won't have office hours.

00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:43.437
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:48.440
PROFESSOR: So I know
that some of you

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.732
have registered for the course.

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.320
And some of you are
here as listeners.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.410
If you are here is a
listener, I have an add form

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.450
and I want you to
add it as a listener,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.640
just so that we have
a record of you,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.770
partly because that
affects the ability

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.600
to offer this course
in the future,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.090
also because we're going
to use online tools

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.790
and we may even use
some online MITx

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.010
tools if I find out that they're
very useful for the course.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.600
So I want you to
be in the system.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.070
And I want you to be able to
access that information if we

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.000
end up going that way.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.110
So I think that's it.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.520
So as far as preamble, does
anybody have any questions?

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.610
OK.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.610
All right.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.965
So let's start.

00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:52.465
So let's start with
the big picture.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.370
I like to say that
the big picture is

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.328
that there's interesting
physics at all scales.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.690
What effective field
theory lets you do

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.760
is it lets you tease out
this interesting physics

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.080
at all scales.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.190
So in particular, you can
focus on a particular scale

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.470
and find the interesting
physics there using

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.620
the tools of effective
field theory.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.200
Now that's a little different
than how we teach physics.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.860
If you think about drawing a
diagram from your freshman year

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.490
to now many of you in graduate
studies about how you learned

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.400
physics, it was not
by kind of focusing in

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.980
on individual particular
scales, but more

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.230
from a kind of
bottom-up point of view.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.980
So I would draw a
picture of how we teach

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.870
physics in the following way.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.540
So you start out as a freshman.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.980
You learn classical mechanics.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:17.640
You learn E&M, classical E&M.
You learn Newtonian gravity.

00:08:22.932 --> 00:08:24.390
And then you build
on these things.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.530
These things are
your starting point

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.655
and then you build on them.

00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:35.429
So you learn quantum
mechanics and that

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.440
builds on classical mechanics.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:46.590
You learn special
relativity, which

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:53.220
is building on both classical
mechanics and electromagnetism.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:09.900
At some point, you learn general
relativity and quantum field

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.400
theory.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.250
And quantum field
theory is synthesizing

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.880
quantum mechanics and special
relativity, and then these two

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.380
here.

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:37.190
So you think about learning
physics from the bottom

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.562
up in this picture.

00:09:38.562 --> 00:09:39.770
You learn these things first.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.700
And then you learn these things.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.140
And you sort of
keep synthesizing,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.257
keep putting things together.

00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:45.840
We're going to be
doing in this course

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.930
the exact opposite of that.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.910
We're going to be taking
one of these blobs--

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.523
in particular, this one--

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:52.940
and we're going
to be looking deep

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.665
inside it trying to make
more and more specific field

00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:56.165
theories.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.870
So if you like, if you
want to draw it as a blob,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.500
we'll be taking quantum
field theory and we'll be

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.410
looking for derivatives of it--

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.425
or perhaps derivatives
of derivatives of it,

00:10:19.425 --> 00:10:22.050
like this-- and figuring out how
to take a very general theory,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.630
like quantum field theory
for the standard model,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.960
and finding things that are more
specific and in some ways more

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.040
powerful than just having
the original theory

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.390
we started with-- more
powerful in the sense of being

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.620
able to do calculations.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.520
So why do we want to do that?

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.820
There's a couple of
different reasons--

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.390
or why do we do
that, since, as I've

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.610
tried to convince you with
the outline of the course

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.230
and some of the
presentation topics,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.170
that this is something that
happens all over the place.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.260
So as you go up in this
chart, it actually becomes--

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.010
even though you have
a more general theory

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.177
and it becomes more beautiful
and you can write down

00:11:35.177 --> 00:11:37.710
a synthesis of physics
in fewer lines,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.910
it also becomes harder
to compute things.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.080
So just as an
example, if you just

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.820
wanted to compute the
energy spectrum of hydrogen,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.740
and you know very
well that you can

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.060
do that in quantum mechanics.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.443
And particularly it's a classic
example, and fairly easy.

00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:04.360
If you try to do that
in quantum field theory,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.130
it's much harder,
because quantum field

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.143
theory, in some sense, has
too much for that problem.

00:12:09.143 --> 00:12:10.060
So that's one example.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.760
Another is the elliptical
orbits of the planets,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.490
which are easier in
Newtonian gravity

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.360
than in general relativity.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.790
And these are just two examples.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.800
There's many more
where the field--

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.440
one of these blobs may be
too general for actually

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.040
tackling the problem that
you want to deal with.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.060
And by focusing in, which
is what effective field

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.710
theory allows you to do,
you can get more ability

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.730
to compute more accurately
and in a simpler fashion.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.030
So what we want when we think
about effective field theory

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.280
is we want the
simplest framework that

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.690
captures the essential physics.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.720
We don't want to carry
along for the ride

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.220
a whole bunch of
superfluous things

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.053
that are not important
for the problem we're

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:15.730
trying to deal with.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.970
But we also don't want
to give up anything.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.170
So we're very demanding.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.180
So even if we're giving up
something in our leading order

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.400
description, we want
to retain the ability

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.770
to correct that leading
order description--

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.070
order by order in
some expansions--

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.375
so that we can make it
as precise as we desire.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.800
So I'll say that we can correct
it, in principle, to arbitrary

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.430
precision.

00:13:52.322 --> 00:13:53.780
So if you like,
what we're doing is

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.690
we're taking quantum field
theory and we're expanding it.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.940
And the lowest order
determine that description

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.800
is an effective field theory.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.400
And that effective field theory
may have different fields.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.670
It may have
different symmetries.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.112
And it will certainly
have ability

00:14:10.112 --> 00:14:11.570
to calculate in a
different fashion

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.100
than the original theory.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.615
But we will keep higher order
terms in that expansion.

00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:17.240
And therefore, we'll
be able to correct

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.750
it to arbitrary precision
just by expanding

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.180
to higher and higher order.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.540
So examples of this that
even are familiar here--

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.520
non relativistic
expansion, getting back

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.860
to non relativistic
quantum mechanics,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.400
or doing a post-Newtonian
expansion in general relativity

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.352
to go back towards
Newtonian gravity.

00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:38.060
You don't have to stop
at the first term.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.740
You can keep higher-order terms.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.310
And in that way,
you could calculate,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.010
for example, energy
levels in hydrogen

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.110
using a non-relativistic
framework that

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.260
encodes all the ingredients
of quantum field theory.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.730
Or you could use--

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.142
you could look at
the orbit of planets

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:54.350
and relativistic corrections
and general relativistic

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.557
corrections by
expanding this theory.

00:14:57.557 --> 00:14:58.640
So those are two examples.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.670
So most of the examples that
I've listed on the project list

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.010
are the type of
taking quantum field

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.040
theory for the standard model.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.110
Some of them involve
gravity, but most of them

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:28.960
involve the standard
model and expanding it

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.270
and focusing in on particular
degrees of freedom.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.270
So let's say that we've
picked a physical system

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.920
and we want to describe it.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.390
What are the things
that we should

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.000
do in order to develop an
effective field theory?

00:15:51.828 --> 00:15:52.620
What are the steps?

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.330
I should say that I'm going
to post my lecture notes.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.580
So if you don't want to take
notes, you don't have to.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.470
If you'd like to take
notes, feel free.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.310
But I will scan
and post my notes.

00:16:22.305 --> 00:16:23.680
So the first thing
you need to do

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.972
is figure out what the relevant
degrees of freedom are.

00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:31.240
What are the things
that actually

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.850
matter for the problem
you want to study?

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.500
Sometimes that is
easier than other times.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.070
Sometimes it's
completely obvious.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.063
You want to study some
low energy properties

00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:41.980
of the standard model.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.438
You get rid of the
heavy particles.

00:16:43.438 --> 00:16:44.740
You keep the light ones.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.270
Fairly straightforward.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.370
Other times it may be
tricky to actually determine

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.230
what the relevant
degrees of freedom are.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.330
And people in the field may
even argue about what they are.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.090
So we'll talk about
examples of both types

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:59.420
here throughout the course.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.296
So it sounds trivial,
but it may not be.

00:17:02.296 --> 00:17:04.588
You also want to think
about the symmetries.

00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:06.130
Sometimes that guides
you in thinking

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.713
about the relevant
degrees of freedom.

00:17:07.713 --> 00:17:10.240
Sometimes these things
go hand in hand.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.190
But that's certainly
an important ingredient

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.119
in developing the
effective field theory.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.670
And you also have to be careful
here, because sometimes you

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.030
might have a theory
that has no symmetry,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.280
or doesn't have an
apparent symmetry.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.829
But when you start expanding--
which is what I've argued

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.000
you're going to be doing--

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.910
when you start expanding, you
may have a symmetry suddenly

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.870
appear.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.270
And we'll actually talk
about several examples

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.690
of that happening throughout
the course, as well.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.990
So your effective field
theory may have more symmetry

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.402
than the theory
you started with.

00:17:43.402 --> 00:17:44.860
Because you've
neglected something,

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.068
you could have more symmetry.

00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:50.680
And the other important
thing is to figure out

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.722
what you're expanding in.

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:00.100
And at the same time,
what the leading order

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.690
description of the theory is.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.622
What is the lowest
order Lagrangian?

00:18:04.622 --> 00:18:06.080
And basically,
these are the things

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.560
you have to do to get started.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.620
If this is true, actually,
independent of kind

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.180
of what theory
you're talking about,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.240
if you're doing quantum field
theory, what this first one

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.620
means is figuring
out what fields

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.662
you're going to be using.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.040
The symmetry is
basically guiding you

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.750
about the interactions.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.210
If you have gauge
symmetry, then of course

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.070
you're going to
write down something

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.277
that respects that symmetry.

00:18:37.277 --> 00:18:39.610
That's going to tell you
something about the interaction

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.050
terms.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.380
And then finally, this
expansion parameters

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.050
goes under the rubric of what
is called power counting.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.920
And if you take those
three things together

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.962
and you figure out the
leading order description,

00:19:03.962 --> 00:19:05.640
then you have an
effective field theory.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.140
You write down he
Lagrangian for it.

00:19:17.736 --> 00:19:19.370
You should try to
use some color.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.340
So if you thought about
regular quantum field theory--

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.098
for example, for
the standard model--

00:19:34.098 --> 00:19:35.640
you'd also do these
first two things.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.840
You figure out what
the fields are.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.040
You figure out what
the interactions are.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.332
But you don't think about
too much about this question,

00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:42.060
about the power counting.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.420
And actually, more broadly, in
the field of effective field

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.690
theory, this idea here of power
counting is very important.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.650
It's as important as
something like gauge symmetry.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.530
It's really a fundamental
thing about the whole framework

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.280
that you're doing.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:17.720
So in an effective field
theory, power counting

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.090
is just as important as figuring
out things like symmetries.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.590
And in particular,
just to make it

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.283
sort of clear that
it's important,

00:20:27.283 --> 00:20:28.700
I'll compare it
to gauge symmetry.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.030
It's really a fundamental
ingredient in what you're doing

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.343
and in the whole theory,
because the power counting

00:20:38.343 --> 00:20:40.760
being consistent is actually
necessary for the whole field

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.270
theory--

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.895
effective field
theory-- to make sense.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.910
OK, so what's the key principle?

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.640
Well, there's a key principle
of quantum field theory

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.500
that we're using when we design
effective field theories.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.385
And that is that we're
insensitive to physics

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.385
at higher energy scales.

00:21:10.654 --> 00:21:15.630
So going back to
Wilson, if we're

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.210
interested in describing
the physics at some scale

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:24.660
m squared, we don't need to
know the details of physics

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.410
at higher energy.

00:21:48.978 --> 00:21:53.028
So at scales lambda squared that
are much bigger than m squared,

00:21:53.028 --> 00:21:55.570
we don't really need to know
the details of the dynamics that

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.962
are going on there.

00:21:56.962 --> 00:21:59.170
We don't need to know the
field content, necessarily,

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.505
at those scales, or anything
else about the dynamics.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.575
And that is, in some
sense, a key idea

00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:12.700
that makes the whole idea
of effective field theory

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.200
possible.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.470
I want you to make
sure that you don't

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.020
think of this too narrowly.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.520
In the way that I've written,
it's actually a little bit too

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.100
narrow, because I said that--

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.940
I've described it in
terms of mass scale.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.120
So I've kind of intuited
in your mind something

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.940
like a Z' boson or
a W' boson, which

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.850
is a heavy particle
from some perspective.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.490
And maybe they treat that
as a heavy particle and I'm

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.760
interested--

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.925
and let me say it differently.

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.550
Say I'm interested
in a light particle,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.860
like the bottom quark.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.460
Then I can get rid of physics at
a heavy scale, like the w mass.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.630
Or if I think about how new
physics impacts precision

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.390
electroweak data and that
new physics is heavy,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.580
then I can think about
effective operators.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.955
That's kind of
the intuition I've

00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:04.080
given you with the sentence
that I've written here.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.200
But it's actually not--

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.670
that's not quite general enough.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.610
And the reason it's not
quite general enough

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.780
is that this mentality doesn't
always apply just strictly

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.820
to math scales.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.555
If I say this-- m squared much
less than lambda squared-- then

00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:19.930
you immediately
think that you're

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.480
expanding an m squared
over lambda squared.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.470
And that, of classic
effective field theory,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.150
that's exactly what you do.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.990
You expand in light scales
divided by heavy scales.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.920
They're mass scales.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.030
They're invariant masses.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.100
They're Lorentz
invariant quantities.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.092
That's the most common
thing that you do.

00:23:35.092 --> 00:23:37.550
We're going to be doing much
more than that in this course.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.675
We'll be doing-- we'll be
talking about cases where

00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.150
the power counting is in
situations that are not simply

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.300
m squared much less than lambda
squared, but other things--

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.010
dimensionless parameters.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.025
So sometimes it will
become more complicated.

00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:51.400
But still, this
guiding principle

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.450
that there's physics that's
far away, in some sense,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.820
from the physics that you're
interested in, that it can

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.900
be removed from the theory when
you're just talking about it,

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.640
in that sense, this
is more general.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.370
It's really not just a
strictly one-dimensional thing,

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.310
as it would be if I describe
it in terms of mass scales,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.890
but a more general principle.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.260
And I think that
will become clearer

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.720
when we actually do examples
where it's not simply

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.980
mass scales.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.040
We will, of course, start out
by talking about mass scale,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.835
since that's the classic
thing that most people think

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:25.710
of when they think of
effective field theory.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.950
So can anyone give
me an example--

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.180
just to try to get the
class engaged here--

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.170
can anyone give me an example of
an effective field theory that

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.815
doesn't involve expanding
strictly in mass scales,

00:24:38.815 --> 00:24:41.477
involves some other
type of expansion?

00:24:41.477 --> 00:24:43.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.270
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.150
HQT you can say is
just an expansion

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:55.564
in lambda QCD over MB
or MC, so not quite.

00:24:55.564 --> 00:24:56.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.480
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
Well, you've studied it.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.630
But correct answer.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.088
Any other thoughts?

00:25:08.088 --> 00:25:09.630
So another example
would be something

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.000
like non-relativistic QED.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.710
If you do non-relativistic
QED, you're

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.480
actually expanding
in the velocity,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.760
not strictly in the
ratio of mass scales,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.400
although you would think,
for example, non-relativistic

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.230
QED would be for a heavy
electron, which is true--

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.230
a heavy, massive particle.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.410
That's not what the power
counting expansion is in.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.180
It'll actually be
in the velocity

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.930
being much less than
the speed of light.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.638
And that actually
plays an important role

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:35.400
in designing the
effective field theory,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.710
determining what the
leading operators are.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.790
So even something
as simple as going

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.010
to higher order
corrections in hydrogen

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.018
involves thinking about--

00:25:46.018 --> 00:25:47.810
thinking beyond this
simple statement here.

00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:55.360
Well, since we're on
the topic of hydrogen,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.990
let me go into a little
more detail there.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:11.070
So just to flesh this out a
bit and to talk about some

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.990
of the things that you
have to be careful about,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.840
I'll phrase an example of
this statement as the fact

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.420
that we don't need to
know about bottom quarks

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:28.550
to describe hydrogen.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.300
Well, that's good.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.230
When you took quantum
mechanics as an undergraduate,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.540
you didn't have bottom
quarks in your description.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.779
So if you did need them, you
would have missed something.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.192
What did you have
in your description?

00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:44.900
Well, in a quantum
field theory language,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.910
you have this diagram.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.760
You had an electron and a
proton with photon exchange.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.300
And you also, when you thought
about the binding energy,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.300
if we work in units where h bar
and c is 1, which I will always

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.480
do, then the binding energy
is 1/2 ME alpha squared.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.470
And if you ask about
the bottom quarks,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.600
the reason that you
didn't need them

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.900
is because they were suppressed.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.870
They weren't negligible--
completely negligible--

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.450
at least, at the level
of how accurately we

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.070
can measure this thing.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.295
Well, they're pretty small.

00:27:20.295 --> 00:27:21.920
They're at the 10 to
the minus 8 level.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.110
And that's because
they come in suppressed

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.030
by the mass of the
electron squared

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.070
over the mass of the
bottom quarks squared.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.000
So how would you think
of them coming in?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.660
Well you'd think of them
coming in through some diagram,

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:45.350
for example, where the bottom
quark couples to the photon

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.860
through a vacuum
polarization like that.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.840
And this diagram,
indeed, will give you

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.390
corrections of this type.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.400
Now, it's a bit more
subtle than that.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.980
And that's because
a diagram like this

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.860
also has other contributions
besides just these ones that I

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.550
mentioned here.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.158
So the basic picture
is, indeed, correct

00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:12.200
that we can neglect the
bottom quark because it's

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.580
giving small corrections.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.110
But there is one subtlety.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.700
And that has to do with the
fact that we have to decide

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.950
what we mean by this coupling.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.370
OK.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:29.510
So from your previous courses
in quantum field theory,

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.148
when you learned about
running couplings,

00:28:32.148 --> 00:28:34.190
you learned the diagrams
like that one contribute

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.610
to running couplings.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.200
And so the B quark, therefore,
can affect the coupling

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.873
if you worked in, for
example, the MS bar scheme,

00:28:45.873 --> 00:28:48.040
since it contributes to the
running of the coupling.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.910
And in particular, you know for
the electromagnetic coupling,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.250
if you ask about what
that coupling is,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.420
it has a different
value because it runs--

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.100
if you evaluate it at a
scale like the W mass,

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.710
then it's like 1/128, versus if
you evaluate it at a very low

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.170
energy, the electron
mass or below,

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:18.270
then it's the classic 1/137.036.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.770
OK.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.540
So there's some change.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.295
And the bottom quark
is part of what

00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:23.420
contributes to that change.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.462
Of course, other particles
are contributing, too.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.440
So if we want to say this
statement about bottom quarks

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.130
and we want to state the
conclusions more precisely,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.450
then we would do it this way.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:58.970
We would say if alpha is a
parameter of the standard model

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.320
and we imagine that we
fix it at a high energy--

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.820
so we could imagine
that we fixed it

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.960
by doing [INAUDIBLE] on physics
in an E plus E minus collider.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.290
But some process that's
a high energy process,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.180
we determine, say, for
example, this value.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.430
If we take that attitude as
how we define the parameter,

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.250
then the parameter
that actually matters

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.950
for hydrogen, which is this
parameter at the low scale,

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:36.718
does depend on the
bottom quark, because how

00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:38.510
we get from the high
scale to the low scale

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.600
depends on the fact that
the bottom quark exists.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.180
But we could also take
a different attitude.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.250
And that is we could take
a low energy attitude.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.830
So we could say, let's forget
about doing high energy

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.800
physics.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.370
Let's just do low energy
physics and extract

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:18.839
alpha of 0 from some low
energy atomic experiments.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.700
And if that's the way that
we define the parameter,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.700
then the value can be
used in other experiments.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.533
And we never have to
know anything about MB.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.500
So we didn't really have to
know about the high energy--

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.558
about the higher energy
theory unless we actually

00:32:00.558 --> 00:32:02.100
were doing some
experiments up there.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.660
Is there any
questions about that?

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.160
Good.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.847
So if we want to write
an equation for that,

00:32:20.847 --> 00:32:22.680
what it means is that
when you integrate out

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.830
particles like the B quark,
remove them from your theory,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:31.470
stop considering them, that
it's not simply the case

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.830
that you generate higher
order terms in the series.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.080
You can also affect what you
mean by the leading order

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.750
term in the sense of changing
what you mean by the coupling.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.300
So if I write it in
terms of Lagrangian,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.690
I would say that the
Lagrangian for hydrogen,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.090
if we include the
B quark, well, it's

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.820
got our proton,
electron, and photon.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.280
And let's keep the B quark.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.490
Alpha and MB are parameters.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.770
If we drop the B quark because
it's giving small effects,

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.450
we just have these fields--
proton, electron, and photon.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:24.240
We get a different coupling
in practice-- in principle.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.730
So you think of this as being
a higher energy coupling

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:30.223
and over there alpha prime
being the low energy coupling.

00:33:30.223 --> 00:33:31.890
There's a lot of other
things, actually,

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.360
that if you think about
hydrogen for a minute,

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.930
there's a lot of other
expansions that you've done.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.360
Hydrogen is a very
fertile ground

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.480
for effective field theory.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.142
So let's do that.

00:33:43.142 --> 00:33:45.600
Let's make a little list of
what we dropped when we thought

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.960
about hydrogen. How much did
we lie to you when we first

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.295
taught you the hydrogen atom
in a quantum mechanics course?

00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:55.920
Well, we didn't teach
you about quarks.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.480
Why didn't we teach
you about quarks?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.907
And the reason we didn't
teach you about quarks

00:34:04.907 --> 00:34:06.990
is because if you think
about the typical momentum

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:12.302
transfer in hydrogen,
three momentum transfer,

00:34:12.302 --> 00:34:14.010
it's [INAUDIBLE] the
mass of the electron

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.679
times the fine
structure constant.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:20.190
And that's much less
than the proton size.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.250
So the typical photons that are
involved in binding together

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.920
the hydrogen atom just have much
lower energy and they can't see

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.760
inside the proton.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.425
They just see it as
one overall object.

00:34:31.425 --> 00:34:33.300
And so we don't need to
know about the quarks

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.730
inside the proton.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:37.830
So that was an expansion.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:50.769
It's also an insensitive
to the proton mass itself.

00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:57.840
So the proton we keep as an
object, but the mass of the--

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.170
again, the momentum
transfer, ME alpha,

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.330
is much less than the
mass of the proton, which

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.930
is of order of GeV.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:10.230
And so we expand in our
treatment of the proton,

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.830
as well.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:17.960
And basically what this
means is that the proton

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.975
acts like a static charge.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.150
But proton mass wasn't
showing up in our lowest order

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.950
description of the energy here.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.233
It would show up in higher order
corrections that we neglect.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.610
And again, it's because
we're expanding.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.400
And that actually affects, when
we design an effective field

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.040
theory for this situation,
how we would treat

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.570
the proton, what
type of Lagrangian

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.210
we would write down for it.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.010
And that will be
one of our topics

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.040
is to figure out how we treat
heavy particles, like a proton,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.670
in this case.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.265
Another expansion that we
did is we used the fact

00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:06.640
that the momentum transfer is
much less than the electron

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.980
mass, not just the proton mass.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.943
And that meant that the
theory is non-relativistic

00:36:12.943 --> 00:36:14.860
and that's why we did
non-relativistic quantum

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.520
mechanics.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.520
If we wanted to do it as
a quantum field theory,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.710
we would do a non-relativistic
quantum field theory.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.510
So already in something
as simple as hydrogen,

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.720
we have here three
expansions plus many more,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.220
thinking about the
particles that we

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.112
neglected in the description.

00:36:37.112 --> 00:36:38.820
AUDIENCE: So the second
point [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.176
and the alpha, how do you know
that's not just the ratio of ME

00:36:42.176 --> 00:36:45.630
by MP rather than ME alpha?

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.320
PROFESSOR: So--

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.153
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:47.153 --> 00:36:49.140
AUDIENCE: --electron
was 1 [? GeV. ?]

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:49.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:50.050
So--

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:50.850
AUDIENCE: We would
care about it.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.767
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:36:51.767 --> 00:36:54.780
So in some sense, I could
have written ME here,

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.373
and that would have been fine.

00:36:56.373 --> 00:36:58.290
If you take these together,
then of course you

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.310
could take a ratio and
you'd get ME over M proton.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.260
The reason I wrote ME
alpha is I was really

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.560
thinking about
the momentum, sort

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.200
of the non-static
properties, the dynamics.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.220
And the momentum of the photons,
the largest energy is this.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.720
That's why I was
thinking about it.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.210
But you're right that I
should write ME over M proton,

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:19.710
as well.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.660
As any other
comments, questions?

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.280
So another point that I just
want to briefly comment,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.850
which has to be true if
everything I'm telling you

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.460
is right, which has to
be true because it's

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:55.910
what we taught you, is that
this whole description is true

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.660
even though there's
ultraviolet divergences.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.410
When you start doing
quantum field theory,

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.493
even if you do quantum
field theory, in this case,

00:38:02.493 --> 00:38:05.990
for the hydrogen atom, you run
into ultraviolet divergences

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.160
where things are blowing up.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.066
Actually, even this diagram
has ultraviolet divergences.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.900
So before you
regulate the theory,

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.970
the bottom quark
group is infinity.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.970
Once you regulate the
theory, it's well-defined.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.300
And you can make
everything well-defined.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.187
But you may worry that
this diagram seems

00:38:28.187 --> 00:38:30.020
to be contributing an
infinite amount rather

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.310
than a finite amount.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.230
And the whole story
goes through even

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.080
in the context of having
ultraviolet divergences.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.543
That better be true,
because, for example,

00:38:41.543 --> 00:38:43.460
if we had graviton loops,
they would also lead

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.500
to ultraviolet divergences.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:51.650
And so we're neglecting gravity.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:54.320
So it better that these ideas
of effective field theory

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.980
are not changed by having
ultraviolet divergences.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.620
And we'll encounter that
in our discussion later on.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.450
OK.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.880
So that gives you
a bit of a sense

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.370
for how these ideas of
effective field theory, you've

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.160
been using them all along,
whether or not you knew it.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.990
And we will, in this
course, flesh out

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.030
how we figure out some
of these corrections,

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.280
how we would actually
compute them,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.070
how we would actually figure out
how to even the leading order--

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.487
what the leading
order description

00:39:29.487 --> 00:39:32.630
of a theory in cases where we
may not know it or someone else

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.890
hasn't figured it out yet.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.598
Those are the type of
things we're after.

00:39:37.887 --> 00:39:40.220
Now, if you talk about the
categories of effective field

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.595
theories, if you
look at the list

00:39:41.595 --> 00:39:44.030
that I handed out to you
or the list of things

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.010
we're going to do
in the course, then

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.440
there's really, in
general, two ways

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.090
that effective field
theories are used.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:14.335
So the two ways are from the
top down or from the bottom up.

00:40:14.335 --> 00:40:15.710
So we'll start
with the top down.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.920
So in the top down
situation, you

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.020
know what the high
energy theory is.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.270
I'm going to keep using
this language of masses,

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.665
where I have a high energy
and low energy theory.

00:40:28.665 --> 00:40:30.290
And we'll think about
it more generally

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.248
when we come to examples
where we need to think

00:40:32.248 --> 00:40:34.020
about it more generally.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.790
So in this top-down case, we
have a high energy theory--

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.440
say, the standard model--

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.330
and that theory is
understood in the sense

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:45.560
that we can write down
the Lagrangian for it.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.550
But we're not
satisfied with that.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:41:01.190
We find it useful to
have a simpler theory

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:09.013
to do some low energy physics,
or even to do some high energy

00:41:09.013 --> 00:41:10.430
physics, where not
all the degrees

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.220
of freedom of this high
energy theory are relevant.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.360
So we're in a situation where
we have some theory, which we'll

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.030
call theory one, which is
this high energy theory

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.340
that we understand
it that we can think

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.037
about doing calculations in it.

00:41:27.037 --> 00:41:29.120
But we want to go over to
some other theory, which

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.230
I'll call theory two, which
has less degrees of freedom.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.300
And we're making expansions.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.040
And that's a low energy theory.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.581
This is the high theory.

00:41:39.581 --> 00:41:42.450
This is the low theory.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.080
So that's what we are in
this situation of what

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.320
we call top down, coming from
the top, from high energy,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.220
down.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.387
So what do we do?

00:41:51.387 --> 00:41:52.970
Well, in this case,
it's kind of nice,

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.640
because we can actually use the
fact that we know this theory

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.820
one and can do calculations
in that theory one

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.830
to even think about
constructing theory two.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.080
So what we can do is we could
just start calculating things

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:21.450
in theory one and integrate
out-- i.e. remove--

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.590
the heavier particles.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.700
And in doing that,
we can do what's

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.680
called matching onto
the low energy theory.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.700
That means we can
use this ability

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.060
to do calculations in
the high energy theory

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.320
to find what the operators
are of the low energy theory,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.740
just by direct calculation.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.170
And also if there's new low
energy constants that show up,

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.810
we can calculate the
values of those constants

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.590
by using information
and connecting them

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.300
to the high energy theory.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.740
So in this case, we're able
to use calculations really

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.330
to construct the
low energy theory.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.500
So just schematically, I
start with some high energy

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:36.930
Lagrangian and I go over to some
low energy Lagrangians where

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.360
there's an infinite series,
which I've indexed by n.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.970
And that index is to
denote higher order

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.608
terms that are less relevant
in whatever expansion

00:43:44.608 --> 00:43:45.150
you're doing.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:56.630
So just to be
general, I'll say it's

00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:00.245
an expansion in decreasing
relevance of the terms.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.360
So if you're in this situation,
then these two theories

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.090
are, in some sense,
describing common things.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.580
The high energy theory describes
more than the low energy

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.247
theory, because you've
removed something

00:44:15.247 --> 00:44:17.270
in constructing a
low energy theory.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:22.430
But the two theories have to at
least agree where they overlap.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:47.050
And so they have to agree on
certain infrared observables,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:52.050
which I will also often
denote as IR for infrared.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.680
The place where they differ
is in the ultraviolet.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.440
So they might have different
ultraviolet divergences.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.410
Most often, they will
have different ultraviolet

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:02.910
divergences.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.340
They don't have to agree
in the ultraviolet.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.290
And actually, you
exploit that to do things

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.510
with the effective theory
that would be hard to do

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.770
with the full theory.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.467
We'll talk about how
we do that later on.

00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:16.800
So the fact that they differ
is actually not necessarily

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.590
a negative thing.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:18.390
It can be a bonus.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.040
And finally, you have to
ask about this sum over n.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.870
Well, this sum
over n is infinite.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:37.390
Goes on forever.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.135
And so you have to ask the
question, when should I stop?

00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:43.010
And therefore you have
to look to experiments

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:49.940
and see how precise they are,
or just to your own perseverance

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.160
and figure out what
level do you want,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.790
what precision do you
want in your description?

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.520
So what n do you
want to stop at?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.020
Sometimes experiment tells you
to only do the first two n's.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.478
Sometimes you have
to decide, maybe

00:46:04.478 --> 00:46:05.970
I only want the first one.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.553
If you're doing it
for the first time,

00:46:07.553 --> 00:46:09.090
I suggest you stop
at the beginning

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:13.380
and let someone else
to do the corrections.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:18.113
This idea of doing this can
be important for separating

00:46:18.113 --> 00:46:19.530
physics of the
high energy theory.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.120
One example of this is in QCD.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.290
If you take QCD for
just about any process,

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.600
there will be some parts of
it which were perturbative

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.150
and some parts of it that
were non-perturbative.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:33.150
And by doing this kind of
thing where you expand,

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.950
you could construct
a low energy theory

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.860
that only has the
non-perturbative scale in it

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.870
and removes all the
perturbative scales.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.540
If you did that, then just doing
this procedure would allow you

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.970
to figure out, what is the
non-perturbative physics

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.810
and what is the
perturbative physics?

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.860
You'd separate out, in
that case, into operators.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.930
You'd separate out
the infrared physics.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.540
You'd have operators built
out of the infrared fields.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.010
And those operators
would describe

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.533
the non-perturbative physics.

00:46:57.533 --> 00:46:58.950
And you'd have
some new low energy

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.980
constants, which would describe
the perturbative physics.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:07.915
And some of the examples that
we'll do will make use of that

00:47:07.915 --> 00:47:08.415
probably.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.600
So that's kind of a
motivation, actually,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:21.492
for some of the examples
in the standard model.

00:47:21.492 --> 00:47:22.950
So if you think
about, for example,

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:32.220
integrating out heavy
particles like the w

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.233
or the z or the top quark,
one of the motivations

00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:39.150
is sometimes what I just
said, to separate out

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.770
perturbative and
non-perturbative physics.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.190
So that's one example.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.810
Heavy quark effective
theory is also

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:51.397
an example of this top-down
effective field theory.

00:47:51.397 --> 00:47:52.980
In heavy quark
effective field theory,

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:57.210
you have a field theory for the
B quark or for the charm quark

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:02.800
but you want to describe things
like the B meson or the charm

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.300
mesons.

00:48:07.245 --> 00:48:09.120
Objects have non-perturbative
physics as well

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.942
as perturbative-- have mostly
non-perturbative physics.

00:48:11.942 --> 00:48:14.400
And in order to do that, you
want to actually integrate out

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.490
the mass scale of the charm
quark or the bottom quark.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:19.380
If you integrate out
the mass of the charm

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.640
quark and the bottom
quark, you go over

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.998
to something called heavy
quark effective field theory.

00:48:22.998 --> 00:48:25.290
But it can be done in exactly
this way that I described

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.402
to you, where do you start
with the theory with the full B

00:48:28.402 --> 00:48:30.360
quark relativistic
description and you actually

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.318
just expand and figure
out what the heavy quark

00:48:32.318 --> 00:48:33.675
effective theory is.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:46.740
So non relativistic QED
and non-relativistic QCD

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.240
are also examples here.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.820
And soft-collinear
effective theory,

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.812
one of our main subjects, is
also an example of this type

00:48:54.812 --> 00:48:57.972
where we can just start
in QCD, do an expansion,

00:48:57.972 --> 00:48:59.430
and get the effective
field theory.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.160
So what's the other category?

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.990
So the other category
is from the bottom up.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.300
And typically in
this case, you're

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.120
interested in using
effective theory logic.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.923
But maybe you don't know
the high energy theory.

00:49:20.923 --> 00:49:22.590
You don't really know
anything about it.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.810
Maybe we've never probed it.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.330
That's one way in which
bottom-up effective field

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.270
theory shows up.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:34.920
Or it could be that the
high energy theory is known

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.510
but actually doing the matching
calculations to integrate out

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.330
the degrees of freedom to do
those calculations explicitly

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:48.060
could be just very,
very difficult.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.480
Maybe it would be
non-perturbative, for example.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.980
So if the matching
is too difficult,

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.750
then you may also
want to be thinking

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:59.550
in this bottom-up framework
where you really just start

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.860
by thinking about
the low energy theory

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.210
without worrying about what
the high energy theory was,

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.363
or without thinking too hard
about the high energy theory,

00:50:09.363 --> 00:50:12.030
and in particular, without doing
calculations in the high energy

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:17.860
theory in order to motivate
the low energy theory.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.538
You need to know some things
about the high energy theory,

00:50:21.538 --> 00:50:23.580
like you may need to know
that it's [? llorens ?]

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.378
invariant, that it has
certain gauge symmetry,

00:50:27.378 --> 00:50:28.545
that it's not totally crazy.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.790
But you don't need to
know it at the level

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.980
where you would actually
carry out calculations with it

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.890
in order to construct
the low energy theory.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:40.890
Instead, you think about
the lower energy theory

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:45.170
from the bottom up, where
you can just devise it

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:48.080
based on the symmetries,
based on your power counting,

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.780
and based on identifying
the degrees of freedom.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:10.950
So construct the series simply
by writing down the most

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.750
general operators
that we can think

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:32.870
of consistent with whatever
degrees of freedom we have,

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.142
and of course, consistent
with the symmetries

00:51:35.142 --> 00:51:35.975
that we're imposing.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.620
OK.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.450
So the picture is
that you don't know

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.930
or you want to remain
agnostic about theory one,

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.320
but you still are interested
in constructing theory two.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.180
If you do this, then
unlike the other case,

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.520
the couplings that you have when
you write down these operators,

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.228
they all are multiplied
by some couplings

00:52:03.228 --> 00:52:06.330
if they're higher
dimensional operators

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.500
and they're not constrained
by gauge symmetry.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.440
Then all of those
couplings are unknown.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.165
But you can fit
them to experiment.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.210
So the effective theory
may still be powerful

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.810
because you can make more
predictions than the number

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:31.351
of parameters that you
have, like for hydrogen,

00:52:31.351 --> 00:52:32.920
where we have very
few parameters

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.462
and the effective theory, but
we can make lots of predictions

00:52:35.462 --> 00:52:38.020
from non-relativistic
quantum mechanics.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.145
Or it could be in
the case where you

00:52:40.145 --> 00:52:41.770
imagine is too
difficult that maybe you

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.562
have to carry out the
matching numerically,

00:52:43.562 --> 00:52:46.090
like with a lot of QCD.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.630
And so that would be
another possible way

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:52.400
of determining couplings.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:57.150
And again, the desired
precision tells us when to stop.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.500
So it's important that we have a
power counting for this theory.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.840
But that power counting
is in some sense defined

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.800
irrespective of what the full
theory was so that we can stop,

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.620
even in the bottom-up case.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.510
So what are examples here?

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.100
Well, the classic
example of this type

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.890
is chiral perturbation
theory, when

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:28.325
you're thinking about a field
theory for kaons and pions.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:36.050
And doing the matching onto
kaons and pions from QCD

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.257
is a non-perturbative
process, so you

00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:40.340
think about constructing
the effective theory just

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.350
from low energy and
from symmetries,

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.510
knowing the symmetry breaking
pattern, in particular.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:47.510
And you construct the
chiral perturbation theory

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:51.530
without thinking about doing
the matching explicitly.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.640
So that's one example.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.442
Another example of
this type is actually

00:53:55.442 --> 00:53:56.525
the standard model itself.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.320
If you think about
the logic that we

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.330
used when we construct
the standard model,

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.870
it was exactly this
effective field theory logic.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.790
We said, what are the
relevant degrees of freedom?

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:11.600
Electron.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.560
Quarks.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.150
W bosons.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.260
Listed them.

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.105
We wrote down.

00:54:16.105 --> 00:54:18.230
We said, what are the
important guiding principles?

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.107
Gauge symmetry.

00:54:20.107 --> 00:54:22.190
And then we wrote down the
most general Lagrangian

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.180
that we could think of.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.640
That was the standard model.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.090
OK, so it's an example of
a bottom-up effective field

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:29.670
theory.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:34.200
We don't ask questions
about what's higher up.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.960
Let me write down the
leading order Lagrangian.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.090
And we can actually
construct higher order terms

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.430
in the standard model
expanding in the idea

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:44.820
that there's physics above the
scales of the standard model

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.560
and write down higher
dimension operators

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.867
and have a real standard model
that has an infinite series.

00:54:50.867 --> 00:54:52.950
So the standard model is
an effective field theory

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.200
that has an infinite
number of operators.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.257
And we'll talk about that
momentarily as well next time.

00:55:00.257 --> 00:55:02.340
So that'll be the first
example we actually treat,

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.297
is the standard model as
an effective field theory.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.050
Another example is
quantum gravity.

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.050
If you take Einstein
gravity and you

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:23.198
make it quantum and you
allow yourself to expand--

00:55:23.198 --> 00:55:25.240
i.e. you say you're only
interested in low energy

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:25.870
physics.

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:28.120
So you allow yourself to
write down an infinite number

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.710
of operators.

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:32.770
Then you can also
renormalize that theory order

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.740
by ordering those infinite
number of operators.

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.600
And so it's also an
example of something

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.040
that you can treat from
this effective field theory

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:40.540
paradigm.

00:55:43.365 --> 00:55:45.240
That was the last topic
that I would actually

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.117
be cover in this-- if we had a
couple extra weeks of lectures,

00:55:48.117 --> 00:55:48.950
I would get to this.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.590
But probably we won't.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.870
So that's a topic that somebody
might pick for their project

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:54.890
at the end.

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:57.920
That's a good presentation.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.440
OK, so important stuff.

00:56:04.705 --> 00:56:06.080
Is there any
question about that?

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.360
Sits well with everybody,
makes them feel good inside?

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:13.860
OK.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.430
So far when we've been
talking about this sum over n,

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:32.300
we've been really thinking
about expansions in powers.

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.580
Some mass scale divided
by some other scale

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.730
being much less than 1.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.710
OK, that's what
we've meant by it.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.550
But when you have two scales
like this, m and lambda,

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.930
you also get logarithms.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.618
So it's not always powers.

00:56:55.618 --> 00:56:56.910
There's also logs that show up.

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.010
And this comment I meant about--

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:05.550
that I made about
ultraviolet divergences

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.640
in the low energy
theory, it can actually

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.470
help you to understand
those logarithms.

00:57:13.886 --> 00:57:17.150
Let's get you over here.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.760
So when you treat
the renormalizaiton

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:27.810
of the low energy theory, as
you know from quantum filtering,

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.840
you have different types of
divergences, power divergences.

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.105
But the logarithmic
divergences, in particular,

00:57:33.105 --> 00:57:36.390
are things that are playing
an important role, often,

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:37.800
in quantum field theory.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.080
And in effective field
theory, it's the same thing.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.870
Logarithms can be tied
to the re-normalization

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:48.100
of the low energy
effective theory

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:54.460
and allow us to sum infinite
series of those logarithms.

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.280
So often just the power counting
and the re-normalization

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.830
of the low energy
theory will actually

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.840
allow us not only to
calculate the logarithms,

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.150
but to think about
summing up infinite series

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:17.050
of those logarithms.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:17.550
OK.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.080
So that was kind
of just elaborating

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.910
on a point I made earlier.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.070
And again, I should say
here that I've said this

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:26.430
in the language of there being
two masses, m1 and m2 and w

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.720
over MB.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.080
But this is actually true
more generally again.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.160
So I'd actually make a claim
that there's not any log

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.830
that you've seen in quantum
field theory that shouldn't

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:40.650
be possible to figure out an
effective field theory that

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:44.280
allows you to understand those
logs and predict logarithms

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.680
at higher orders in
perturbation theory.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.840
There's not an example
in quantum field theory

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.347
that I've met that hasn't
fallen into that rubric where

00:58:51.347 --> 00:58:53.430
some effective field theory
description allows you

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:56.170
to understand the logarithms.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:56.670
OK.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.728
So that's kind of a bonus.

00:59:00.728 --> 00:59:02.020
It's not the guiding principle.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.020
It's not what we're doing when
we're expanding in powers.

00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:09.010
But it's something that
we get along for the ride.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:10.510
And maybe it would
be the motivation

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.790
if you see some logarithms
and some process

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.150
and you want to understand them.

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.625
Maybe we would
say, well, I'd like

00:59:16.625 --> 00:59:19.000
to understand what effective
field theory would give rise

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.708
to a description where
I could understand

00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:23.745
those logarithms from a
re-normalization perspective.

00:59:23.745 --> 00:59:25.120
And sometimes
that's very useful,

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.910
because maybe those logarithms
are phenomenologically

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:29.680
important and you want
to make predictions

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.870
about higher order logarithms,
or maybe there's controversy.

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:37.090
When I was a postdoc,
there was some controversy

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:43.120
about a term that was alpha
to the 8 log cubed alpha

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.990
in hydrogen energy levels.

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:49.720
8 powers of alpha,
3 powers of logs.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.918
There was four groups.

00:59:50.918 --> 00:59:52.210
Two of them had got one answer.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.310
Two of them had
got another answer.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:56.227
And using the ideas of
effective field theory,

00:59:56.227 --> 00:59:58.768
we were able to figure out that
one of those groups was right

00:59:58.768 --> 01:00:00.550
and the other was
wrong very clearly,

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:04.322
because you could
connect these logarithms

01:00:04.322 --> 01:00:05.530
to an effective field theory.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:08.072
And then the whole consistency
of that effective field theory

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:10.510
really allows you to
connect this logarithm

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:14.260
to other logarithms and really
to build a picture for what's

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.440
going on with the physics that
makes it totally clear what

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.470
the answer must be.

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.970
OK.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.360
So just to give you an
example from my own past.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.030
So let's now turn to this
question of the standard model

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:44.667
as an effective field theory.

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:51.520
So we have sum over n
and we're treating this

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.490
from the bottom up.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:54.700
So we're going to
just talk about what

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.580
the degrees of freedom
are and then think

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.870
about constructing operators.

01:01:02.648 --> 01:01:04.690
And part of the job has
already been done for us,

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.988
because I'm assuming
you have a background

01:01:06.988 --> 01:01:09.280
in the standard model, at
least at the level of knowing

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.732
what the Lagrangian is.

01:01:10.732 --> 01:01:12.190
And if you haven't,
then you should

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.210
look at the quantum field
theory three lecture notes.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:19.540
So the L0 here is
the standard model,

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.370
as taught in quantum
field theory three.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.600
So [INAUDIBLE] be interested
in as the higher order terms.

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.953
But let me
nevertheless remind you

01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:38.370
of what the degrees of freedom
were in the standard model.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.310
So you at least know
what the players are

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.780
when we go to talk about L1.

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:54.210
So it's a gauge theory.

01:01:57.609 --> 01:02:05.200
So we have color across
Su 2 weak across the un

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.726
of hypercharge.

01:02:07.726 --> 01:02:20.650
And so we have eight gluons
here, three week bosons here,

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:23.710
and one guy here.

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.290
So just to introduce
some notation for fields,

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.200
I'll call these guys with
an index capital A running

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.390
from 1 to 8, these
guys with an index

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:38.850
lower a running from 1 to 3.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:42.780
And B here would be
the analog of a photon

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.770
field for U1 electromagnetism.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:49.300
But this is the U1 of
hypercharge, so it's B mu.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.110
So we have gauge bosons.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.210
We have fermions.

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.610
Let me do the
fermions over here.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.620
So an important
thing and thinking

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.330
about this as an
effective field theory

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:08.920
is to note what the
mass scales are.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.060
So maybe I should do
that already here.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.530
Protons are massless.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:21.820
That's one combination
of the weak and U1 boson.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.160
Gluons are massless.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.440
That's these guys.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:35.188
And then there's the mass
of the W. 80.42 GB the mass

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:40.390
of the Z, 91.19.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.348
And for the first time in
me teaching this course,

01:03:44.348 --> 01:03:46.140
we also know what the
mass of the Higgs is.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.170
So let me just--

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.688
that's not part of
the gauge theory,

01:03:48.688 --> 01:03:50.230
but I'll just list
it there, as well,

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.980
since it doesn't fit
in with the fermions.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:04.660
So fermions-- so you can
see that these scales here

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.110
are kind of similar.

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:08.360
For the fermions, there's
a broad spectrum of scales.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.568
And that's why I wanted to
put them all on one board.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:24.280
So quarks-- up quarks, down
quarks, strange quarks--

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.400
they all come in left and
right handed [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.350
and the gauge couplings
are different for left

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:33.088
and right handed, for the
electroweak and U1 parts

01:04:33.088 --> 01:04:33.880
of the gauge group.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.830
So there are six different
flavors and both right

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.050
and left handed.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.180
What masses do we have?

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.070
Up quarks and down
quarks are rather light,

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:52.525
about a couple of MeV.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.820
It's hard to measure
the light ones.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.827
It's a little easier to measure.

01:05:02.827 --> 01:05:04.160
Everything's going to be in MeV.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.370
I'm going to stop writing MeV.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.050
Oh, that's not true.

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:10.240
I switched to GeV.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.000
Sorry.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.250
Everything is
going to be in GeV.

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:25.505
Oh, sorry.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:26.380
That's the top quark.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.510
OK.

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.220
So there's a pretty
wide range of scales

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:47.150
here from an MeV to 100 GeV.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:49.022
That's just the quarks.

01:05:49.022 --> 01:05:50.480
And then we also
have the leptons--

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.150
three types of charge
leptons, again,

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:04.815
with a fairly wide
range of scales.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.790
So now I'm switching
back to MeV,

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:14.040
just to keep you on your toes.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:18.770
Whoops.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.490
Then we have neutrinos.

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.830
The left-handed ones
we've studied much more

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:33.600
than anything else.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.350
And in particular,
what we know most about

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:39.280
the left-handed guys is mass
splittings from neutrino

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.245
oscillations.

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:42.790
And these are pretty
small numbers.

01:06:46.425 --> 01:06:48.050
We also know that
overall, these things

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.530
are quite light, from
cosmological constraints

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:52.659
and otherwise.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.150
And we don't really
know about anything

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:07.570
like a sterile neutrino but that
we can put bounds on its mass.

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.110
So even within the
standard model,

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.527
there's a lot of
different scales.

01:07:12.297 --> 01:07:14.630
And if you think about it
from an effective field theory

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:17.210
point of view and you think
about it from the top down,

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:19.850
the first thing you'd get rid
of would be the top quark.

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:23.660
And then you'd get rid of the
W and the Z and the Higgs.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.380
And then you would proceed down.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.595
The next thing to go would be
the bottom quark, et cetera.

01:07:29.595 --> 01:07:31.970
And you could think about
constructing an effective field

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:33.865
theory by integrating
out one at a time,

01:07:33.865 --> 01:07:35.990
getting a new effective
field theory every time you

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:38.216
remove a degree of freedom.

01:07:38.216 --> 01:07:39.680
You could take
the standard model

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.858
and expand in that fashion.

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:44.150
That's not the sense in which
we are thinking about it.

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:46.692
That would be the top-down sense
of taking the standard model

01:07:46.692 --> 01:07:48.200
and deriving something else.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.780
We're thinking of it here
in a different context

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.162
where we have all this stuff.

01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:53.870
And we're actually
interested in thinking

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.670
about physics at
higher energy scales,

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.930
beyond the scale
of the weak bosons,

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.140
beyond the scale of the
top quark, the things

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:04.143
we're trying to figure
out at the LHC, scales

01:08:04.143 --> 01:08:05.060
we're trying to probe.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.910
That's the attitude in
this bottom-up approach.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.300
OK.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.800
So the lowest order
Lagrangian would

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.170
be the gauge sector of
the thermionic Lagrangian,

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.189
the Higgs Lagrangian.

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:29.098
And if we have
right-handed neutrinos,

01:08:29.098 --> 01:08:30.640
we'd need a Lagrangian
for them, too.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:42.790
So these are topics that
come up in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:49.229
I'm not even going to
touch them at the moment.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:57.540
I can't give you a complete
review, but just a taste,

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.725
emphasizing things
that are important.

01:09:00.725 --> 01:09:07.838
So to give you a taste, I
just write the other two down,

01:09:07.838 --> 01:09:09.380
which are the prettier
parts, anyway.

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:18.620
So we have field strengths
for the kinetic terms

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.495
for our gauge bosons.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.540
And the thermionic
Lagrangian, I can write it

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.609
as a sum over the
left handed fields--

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:38.060
fermion, covariant
derivative fermion.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.440
Add a sum over
right handed fields.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.620
Fermion covariant
derivative fermion

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:51.220
where this covariant derivative
is a covariant derivative

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.750
with these gauge fields.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:10:00.960
So there's some gauge
coupling, G1, for hypercharge,

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.460
some gauge coupling, G2,
for [INAUDIBLE] weak,

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.490
and some gauge
coupling, G, for QCD.

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:20.064
So what is the power counting?

01:10:20.064 --> 01:10:24.940
So we've just said what
the degrees of freedom are

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.060
and what kind of some of
the guiding principles

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.282
are-- the symmetries,
the gauge symmetry.

01:10:31.282 --> 01:10:33.490
You learn much more about
symmetries in quantum field

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.780
theory three, so I'm not
going to go into that.

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.250
But those are basically
the guiding principles

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.470
in figuring out this L0.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.980
What is it that we would do
a power counting in here?

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.110
So the power counting in
this bottom up approach

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.730
is related to what we left out.

01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:02.650
So we're expanding
an epsilon here,

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:06.580
where epsilon is mass scales
in this standard model divided

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.800
by things that we've left
out of our description.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.220
So in the numerator would
be things like the top quark

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:17.140
mass, the W mass, Z mass,
Higgs mass, all the mass scales

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.640
of the standard model.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.040
In the denominator,
well, certainly something

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.750
like M plank is left out
of our description here.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.120
If we had some grand
unified theory,

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.010
that goes in the denominator.

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:32.920
If we have supersymmetry
and we broke it,

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.310
that would go in
the denominator.

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:36.010
So from this effective
field theory point of view,

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:38.260
any physics that we've left
out of the standard model

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:42.050
description is anything that
generates a higher energy

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.550
scale.

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.246
That goes in the denominator.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.515
And this is what we expanded.

01:11:56.515 --> 01:11:58.890
So even not knowing something
about what this physics is,

01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:02.430
we can come up with a universal
description-- a universal L1--

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.650
that describes corrections
beyond the standard model.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.370
And what will be describing
that physics is higher

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:14.340
dimension operators-- operators
beyond dimension four.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:25.670
But they'll be built out
of standard model fields.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:42.060
So kind of from your teaching
of quantum field theory, maybe

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.150
perhaps the idea that these
two things are connected

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:47.580
may be clear to you,
but it's something

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:55.530
that we will actually cover
mostly next class, actually.

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:57.670
Some part of the
beginning of next class,

01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.250
we'll make this connection
between the fact

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.790
that we want to expand in
that epsilon and the fact

01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.522
that we can do--
in doing so, we get

01:13:05.522 --> 01:13:06.730
higher dimensional operators.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.682
We'll make that
absolutely clear.

01:13:08.682 --> 01:13:09.640
That'll come next time.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:15.750
So in the remainder
of today, let

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:22.620
me just address one
final point, and that

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.590
is the idea of what it means
to have a renormalizable field

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.210
theory.

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:29.820
So in our description of the
standard model that I gave

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.708
here, I mentioned symmetries.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.000
I mentioned degrees of freedom.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.436
I didn't mention
renormalizability.

01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:46.280
So what does
re-normalizable mean?

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.070
So the traditional definition
of what renormalizable will mean

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.540
would be the following.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:59.130
You would say a theory
is renormalizable

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:06.620
if at any order in perturbation
theory in this quantum field

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:20.956
theory the UV divergences
can be absorbed--

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:24.215
so there's UV divergences
from loop integrals.

01:14:24.215 --> 01:14:26.340
If they can always be
absorbed into a finite number

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.146
of parameters, then you'd say
the theory is renormalizable.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.430
But that's a
traditional definition.

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.388
And we will use a more
general definition here.

01:14:46.177 --> 01:14:47.760
Certainly this was
a guiding principle

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.552
when people constructed
the standard model.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.390
What is the effective field
theory definition of this?

01:14:55.390 --> 01:15:00.360
It's a little more
general because it

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.950
brings in the idea of
doing power counting.

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:08.160
So the effective field
theory's definition

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.620
allows for the possibility
of having an infinite number

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.210
of parameters.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.388
But at any order that
you truncate the theory,

01:15:14.388 --> 01:15:15.930
there should only
be a finite number.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:26.770
So it says that a theory must
be renormalizable order by order

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:28.654
in its expansion parameter.

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:35.588
Well, if there's more than
one, it's expansion parameters.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.820
So even just this
sentence alone tells you

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.000
why power counting is
such an important part

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.970
of the effective theory,
because the effective theory

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:51.010
to make sense as a
renormalizable quantum field

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:53.560
theory needs to know about
its expansion parameter.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.498
We're saying that
it's renormalizable,

01:15:55.498 --> 01:15:57.040
that we can make
sense of the theory,

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.370
absorb all the infinities, only
order by order in expansion

01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:02.920
parameters in general.

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:12.185
So it could be that you
do some calculation,

01:16:12.185 --> 01:16:13.715
you counter some divergences.

01:16:13.715 --> 01:16:15.590
But if they're higher
order in the expansion,

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:18.590
then what you need-- and you
have a power counting that

01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:19.760
tells you that--

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.892
they would be absorbable
into some operators

01:16:21.892 --> 01:16:24.350
that you haven't even written
down, you can just drop them.

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:41.140
So this definition allows
for an infinite number

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.430
of parameters that are
needed, for example,

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:54.170
for normalizability, but only
a finite number at some fixed

01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:54.670
order.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.785
Now, if you take this
logic that I just

01:17:07.785 --> 01:17:09.910
said to you, that you could
think about things more

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:11.530
generally, then
you can ask, well,

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:14.250
what was the point of thinking
about the standard model, where

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.000
the theory turned out
to be renormalizable

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.900
in the traditional sense?

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.100
How does this fact, which is
just a subset of this case,

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.500
but an important
one, how does it

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.170
fit into this rubric
from an effective field

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.640
theory point of view?

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.660
And so the way that that
fits in is as follows.

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:36.310
It could turn out that
your L0 in your expansion

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:39.040
is renormalizable in the
traditional sense rather

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.140
than this more general sense.

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.150
And if that's
true, what it means

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:52.930
is that you don't see the higher
energy scales from your lowest

01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:53.740
order Lagrangian.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:11.920
So we do not know
directly about lambda

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.590
new from just looking at L0.

01:18:17.233 --> 01:18:19.150
And that's what happens
in the standard model.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:22.593
We don't really know
precisely what the high energy

01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:24.010
scale should be
just from studying

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:26.650
the effect-- from studying
the leading order Lagrangian.

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:28.070
This will not
always be the case.

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.470
Sometimes we'll
be in a situation

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:32.613
where when we study the
effective theory at lowest

01:18:32.613 --> 01:18:34.030
order in the
Lagrangian, we really

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:36.910
find that even in order to
make sense of that as a quantum

01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:39.550
field theory that we need to--

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:41.530
that there's a scale
that gets generated

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:43.310
and it's part of our expansion.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:45.430
And there's some terms
that we calculate

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.400
with L0 that end up being
higher order in our expansion.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.430
And we can't
renormalize the theory

01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:55.570
unless we actually include
higher dimension operators.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:58.090
Chiral perturbation theory
is an example of that type.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:00.560
And that's an example
that we'll treat.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.560
So it's not always the
case in the standard model,

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.830
whether it's renormalizable
in a traditional sense.

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:11.030
That's a special case,
though it's an important one.

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.860
So questions?

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:21.575
OK, so hopefully this has been
partly a review of some things

01:19:21.575 --> 01:19:23.950
that you've thought of before,
but putting them together,

01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:25.690
perhaps in a nicer package.

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:28.450
And we'll continue
next time talking

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:30.702
about the standard model as
an effective field theory.

01:19:30.702 --> 01:19:31.910
What can be gained from that?

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:34.750
How do we construct
the operators?

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:37.260
And we'll keep going from there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.992
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.486
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:04.980
[CLICKING]

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:12.210
FRANK SCHILBACH: OK.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.770
So let me sort of
just recap what

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.140
we discussed last
time fairly quickly,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.180
and then I want to move
to empirical evidence

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.710
on a variety of settings.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.050
We might not get through
all of the slides.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.070
That's fine.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.370
In that case, we'll just discuss
some of this in recitation.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.210
So let me sort of recap
what Kahneman and Tversky,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
in their 1979 article,
were proposing

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.510
based on a bunch of experiments
and empirical evidence

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.610
that they had collected.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
So their theory, it was
called prospect theory

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.950
what they proposed.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.050
Versions of prospect
theory is essentially

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.500
versions of reference dependent
utility, have been used

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.608
or used prominently
now in economics.

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.150
So the first thing
that they proposed

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.550
was, what matters, what
the carrier of utility is,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.390
is changes rather than levels.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.370
That's to say it doesn't matter
for you necessarily how warm it

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.870
is.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.370
It matters kind of what's the
change of temperature compared

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.140
to yesterday.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.640
It doesn't matter
that much how much

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.170
money people have in total.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
It matters how much that
changes relative to what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.290
they had previously.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.750
More generally, what matters
for people is essentially

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.220
a certain consumption
or the like relative

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.240
to reference point as
opposed to in absolute terms.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
Second, loss aversion, this is
losses loom larger than gains.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.910
And we had some evidence of
that in the last lecture.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.110
That's to say, if you lose
some money or some consumption

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.040
or anything else,
grades, et cetera,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.350
a loss relative to
either your status

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
quo or to your expectation
looms larger, is more important,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.010
hurts more than a gain
of the same magnitude

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.200
in the positive direction.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.660
And number three, which
we talked about quickly,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.380
is what's referred to as
diminishing sensitivity.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.470
That is people are risk
averse in the gain domain,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.020
but risk loving in
the loss domain.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.539
That's to say, for example, if
you think about distance, time,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.380
chance, and the like, going
from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 2

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.810
or from 2 to 3 is
more important for you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.400
than going from, like, 100 to
101, 101 to 102, and so on.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.700
Essentially, the
further you go away

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.120
from your status quo,
your reference point,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.490
any marginal change
is diminishing, right?

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.310
And that's true for both
the gain domain and the loss

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.810
domain.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.720
So these are sort of the
main three characteristics

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.728
related to what Kahneman-Tversky
called the value function.

00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:41.520
We can think of this
as essentially version

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.267
of the utility function.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:44.850
There's a fourth
characteristic, which

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.808
is probability weighting,
which we're not going

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:49.170
to talk about at least for now.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.870
Are there any questions on
these three things so far?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.610
OK.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.310
So now, prospect theory is
then what Kahneman and Tversky

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.120
were proposing.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.010
They were essentially
saying, instead of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.820
having concave utility,
which I showed you last week,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.790
instead your utility
function may look like this.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.580
And what are sort of the
features of this utility

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.360
function?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.913
What are the three key features
that I just showed you?

00:03:19.913 --> 00:03:21.830
How are they showing up
in this function here?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.040
Yes?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.873
AUDIENCE: C minus
[INAUDIBLE] is the change?

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:36.832
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:03:36.832 --> 00:03:38.610
So the carrier of the
utility function--

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.030
so what we have here is c and r.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.082
c is like consumption.

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:43.040
That could be anything.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.850
That could be apples.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.767
That could be bananas.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.990
That could be sort of how
much money people have

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.840
available to consume overall.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.480
The carrier of the utility
function is not c itself.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.360
It's c minus r, so it's c of
relative to some reference

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.840
point r.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.240
That's exactly right.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.520
And if r is the
status quo, if r is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.310
how much we have right now
or the person has right now,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.430
c minus r is the change
relative to the status quo.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.005
Notice that r-- we're going to
talk about this a little bit--

00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:11.130
could be also other things.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.500
It doesn't have to be
necessarily the status quo.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.100
It could be also people's
expectation or their goals

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.380
or their aspirations
for the future, right?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.089
The key part is,
however, what matters

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.980
is-- this is the first
thing I was saying.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.050
It's changes rather
than levels, changes

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.960
relative to some reference
point or consumption relative

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.252
to some reference point.

00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:29.210
That's number one, yes.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.155
Yes?

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:34.530
AUDIENCE: The
curve flattens out,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.140
which is diminishing
sensitivity.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.590
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.670
The curve flattens out
in both directions.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.670
That's diminishing sensitivity.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.340
It's essentially concave
in the gain domain,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.220
in the domain where
c is larger than r.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.020
And it's convex
in the loss domain

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.870
where c is smaller
than r, right?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.920
And that's exactly the issue
that essentially the first,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.050
the marginal change,
going from, say, 1 to 2

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.510
is relatively large compared
to a marginal change going

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.620
from 10 to 11.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.350
That's both going in the right
direction in the gains domain

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.450
and the left direction
in the loss domain.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.420
Yes?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.960
AUDIENCE: For the loss
aversion, the left side

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.630
is steeper than the right side.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.672
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:18.290
In particular, there's
a kink in this function.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.100
When you look at 0, where c
equals r, the gain and loss

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.720
domain intersect, there we have
a kink in the value function,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.510
in the utility function, which
essentially exactly is the loss

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.210
domain, the loss aversion which
is like going to the right

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.190
is less steep than
going to the left.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.870
Put differently, if
you lose, if you're

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.820
sort of below the
reference point,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.807
that's more painful than being
the same amount of units to be

00:05:45.807 --> 00:05:46.890
above the reference point.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.640
That's number two.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.980
That's essentially
exactly the loss aversion.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.390
So I just wrote
down all of that.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.480
Again, let me repeat.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.880
Carrier of the utility changes
relative to the reference

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.720
point--

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.940
excuse me-- rather than levels.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.010
Second, there's loss aversion.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.750
There's a kink at
0 in this function.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.640
And three, there's
diminishing sensitivity,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.270
which is concavity in gains
and convexity in losses.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.090
Any questions on that?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.343
Now, a key question here is--

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.510
I want to sort of flag this.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.740
We're going to talk
about this a little bit

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.823
at the end of the lecture.

00:06:20.823 --> 00:06:23.323
We're going to talk to this a
little bit in the next problem

00:06:23.323 --> 00:06:25.740
set is kind of like how is the
reference point determined.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.540
And does it matter?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.550
As I said before, in
Kahneman-Tversky's work,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.840
a lot of the reference
point is the status quo.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.020
So they essentially
postulated the status quo is

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.510
what really matters originally.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.583
I think people have moved toward
saying the reference point.

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:42.000
And this is what Koszegi and
Rabin and others have written

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.430
down in their models of
reference dependence utility

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.110
and recent more economics
work is what really matters

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.440
is expectation.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.690
So what do you expect to
consume or to have and so on?

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.710
That matters.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.325
That sometimes coincides
with the status quo.

00:06:58.325 --> 00:06:59.700
For example, if
you have a house,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.367
the status quo is
that you have a house.

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:04.050
You probably assume that you
have a house in the future.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.340
These things coincide.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.900
If you think about
wages, et cetera,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.210
what seems to matter
often is not so much

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.370
what people's wages
are right now.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.770
What matters is what
wage gains and so on do

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.720
they expect to
receive in the future.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.800
And they evaluate their future,
their outcomes in the future,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.740
not necessarily to the
current wage, but rather

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.690
what they expect they
would get in the future.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.190
OK.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.810
And so here's an example.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.210
And you'll have some
problems set questions.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.040
Again, this is a
problem set three--

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.440
which is not posted
yet, but will be--

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.290
of that kind, which is
you might have reference

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.060
dependent utility over--

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.680
this is just a very
simple example--

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.760
shirts and money.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.780
So you have essentially
two different domains.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.630
You have, essentially,
losses and gains over

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.040
both of those domains.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.810
You have a reference
point, which is rs,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.227
is how many shirts
you might have.

00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:53.100
You have a reference point, rm,
how much money you might have.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.900
Now, what's important
here is that,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.150
essentially, when you
think about buying a shirt

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.420
or selling a shirt,
there's going

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.547
to be two dimensions which
you have to sort of consider.

00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:05.130
And when you think
about the endowment

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.500
effect of [INAUDIBLE]
and so on, you

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.830
have to consider
not only the losses

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.173
and gains and shirts, but also
the losses and gains and money.

00:08:15.173 --> 00:08:17.340
So that's to say, if you're
trying to buy something,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.840
you're going to get
a gain in shirts

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.060
relative to the reference
point if it's unexpected.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.890
But you'll also have
a loss in money.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.720
Similarly, if you're
going to sell a shirt,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.650
you're going to have a loss in
shirts, but a gain in money.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.390
And these things then interact.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.728
Now, what's the value function?

00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:33.270
The value function,
as I said before,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.909
is usually concave
in the gain domain

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.679
and convex in the last domain.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.630
There's a kink at 0.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.640
It's steeper on the
left than on the right.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.670
Usually, we think the relative
slope is about 2, 2.5, OK?

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.010
So one version of that
would be this function

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.940
that I wrote down.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.920
Again, there will
be some problem

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.080
set questions, et cetera,
sort of to clarify that.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.050
But one key question
here is, then

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.370
what are the different domains?

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.020
And that's kind of a question
of mental accounting.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.235
We'll get to this in the
second half of the course.

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.610
The question's
kind of like, what

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.818
are the different categories?

00:09:06.818 --> 00:09:07.950
Do you have shirts?

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.800
Do you have pants, sweaters?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.680
Or is it just for
clothes overall?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.490
Or when you think about earnings
and consumption, et cetera,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.510
is it daily consumption?

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.560
Is it weekly consumption?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.190
Is it monthly consumption?

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.150
So there's lots of questions
on how to exactly specify

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.560
this utility function.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.590
These questions are mostly
unanswered in the literature.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.445
So for now, for us
in our purposes,

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:32.820
we're going to
essentially assume

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.490
there is a value
function given and then

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.900
sort of work with that.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.610
Any questions on that?

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.120
OK, great.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.160
So now, we're going
to talk about a number

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.310
of different applications.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.480
We talked a little bit already
about the endowment effect

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.380
and about insurance.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.660
I'm going to skip this.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.565
There's some of this already in
recitation in the problem sets.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.690
We're going to particularly
talk about labor supply

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.310
and employment
decisions, essentially

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.990
how much do people like to work.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.150
And is effort or
people's work decisions,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.430
are they reference dependent?

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.180
We're going to talk
about finances,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.540
what was mentioned last time
already about investment

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.110
decisions.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.963
When do people sell
and buy stocks?

00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:16.380
We're going to
talk about housing.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.300
When do people decide to sell or
buy a house and at what price?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.970
We're going to talk about
sports, in particular marathon

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.510
running and golf.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.280
There's some papers
on domestic violence

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.990
we're going to talk
very briefly about.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.740
And then we talk a
little bit about firms.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.790
How do firms think
about pricing and so on?

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.340
What is sort of
the market response

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.140
to reference dependence?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.690
That's to say, given that we
know there's lots of reference

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.900
dependence in the
world, now, as a firm

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.070
or treating other people,
how should we think about,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.020
how does that affect,
our own behavior

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.750
or how maybe firms
interact with us?

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.710
OK.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.230
So let's start
with labor supply.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.130
Let's start with a
very simple example.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.650
Suppose there's a worker
in the following situation.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.110
She can freely choose how many
hours she works every day.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.330
And there are frequent temporary
changes in her hourly wage.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.220
Now, there's different
relationships

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.620
between wages and hours per day.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.080
You could always work
the same number of hours.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.960
You could work more hours on
the days when wages are high.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.137
Or you could work fewer hours
on days when the wages are high.

00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:27.720
What does sort of
standard theory say?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.590
What should you do?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.130
Yes?

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.700
Two?

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.300
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.190
FRANK SCHILBACH: Why is that?

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.262
AUDIENCE: Because that maximizes
your expected value for time.

00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:47.220
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.070
So if hours are effortful, you
usually don't like to work.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.370
You should work
during the hours when

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.558
your payment is the largest.

00:11:56.558 --> 00:11:57.100
That's right.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.920
So what about option number one?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.450
Why might option
number one be optimal?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.225
So what you're saying
is exactly right.

00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:06.442
It depends a little
bit on something else.

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:07.150
And what is that?

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:12.310
Why might you choose
number one anyway?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.970
AUDIENCE: Habit-forming is nice.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.640
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah, there
could be sort of habits,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.130
exactly.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.047
Or it could just be that
it's really effortful

00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:22.750
to work 12 hours in one day.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.180
Maybe there's kids at home, or
maybe it's just really tedious

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.680
to work.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.430
At some point, you just want
to go home and do other stuff.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.900
So it could just be that working
beyond, say, eight or nine

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.435
hours per day is
really tough to do.

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:34.810
So then you might
say, I'm always

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.893
going to work eight hours.

00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:38.385
I'd love to work more,
but it's difficult to do.

00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:39.760
So essentially,
it's just to say,

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.930
if the function of the effort as
a function of hours is convex,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.845
then you might sort
of keep it the same.

00:12:46.845 --> 00:12:48.220
Surely, what you
don't want to do

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.210
is number three,
working fewer hours

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.300
on days when wages are high
unless effort costs are

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.770
particularly high on those days.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.750
So it could be that
it's really super hot.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.990
Or it could be it's tedious
to work on those days.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.990
And you might say, then
you don't want to do it.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.480
But assuming that's
not the case,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.788
you kind of want to avoid this.

00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:07.330
Because for the same
number of hours,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.710
you're going to make
less money overall.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.010
And so here's a
concrete example.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.280
Suppose wage is 5 hours
an hour on day one

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.190
and 10 hours a day on day two.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.700
So there's three strategies.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.170
You can work 8
hours on both days.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.960
You can work 6 hours on day
one, 9 hours on day two,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.950
or the opposite, 9 hours on
day one and 6 hours on day two.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.313
So if you do that, you can sort
of calculate how much that is.

00:13:30.313 --> 00:13:32.230
You can essentially work
8 hours on both days.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.310
You get 120 hours.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.980
You can work 6 hours
on days one and two,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.200
which makes $120 as well.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.130
Or you can essentially do the
opposite, which makes you $105.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.510
This is what I was saying.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.180
Option three doesn't
make a lot of sense

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.950
unless effort costs
are particularly

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.350
high on certain days
when the wages are high.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.730
We're assuming
that away for now.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.688
And so now option two--

00:13:56.688 --> 00:13:58.605
and this is what you
were saying-- essentially

00:13:58.605 --> 00:13:59.770
saves you an hour overall.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.950
You work only 15 hours
instead of 16 hours.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.270
And you make the
same amount of money.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:10.360
Now, unless the ninth hour is
extremely costly for you to do,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.410
you might not want to do that.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.200
OK.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.390
Now, why might you do
something else instead?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.000
Or where does reference
dependence come in here?

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.100
Yes.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.105
AUDIENCE: I see on the
high wage day you make more

00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:31.743
than the less wage day, so
I feel like stopping maybe.

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.410
FRANK SCHILBACH: And
why would you stop?

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.686
What's causing you to stop?

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:40.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] wages
higher relative to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.920
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.520
Yes.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.880
And so what are you evaluating?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:53.540
Or what's the-- or what
happens, for example,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.563
if you work only 6 hours
on a different day?

00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.730
How much do you make on the
sixth hour day, I guess,

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.960
which would be $30, right?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.448
And so what are you
comparing that to, I guess?

00:15:09.448 --> 00:15:11.490
AUDIENCE: You're comparing
it to the actual money

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.952
you made at the end of the day.

00:15:12.952 --> 00:15:13.910
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.213
But so suppose you,
on average, want

00:15:16.213 --> 00:15:17.630
to make a certain
amount of money,

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.870
which is $50, $60 and so on.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.370
Now, if on some days you make
a lot of money and on some day

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.850
you make very little
money, you might sort of

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.082
evaluate that separately
and say, on that day,

00:15:27.082 --> 00:15:28.540
I'm essentially in
the loss domain.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.880
I'm below my target or
below my expectation.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.840
And so if you evaluate
your utility that way,

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.360
you might sort of not want that
because it feels essentially

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.070
you're below a
certain threshold.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.700
It feels kind of like a loss
relative to your expectation

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.810
and so on when you might
be inclined to work

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.760
a lot of hours.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.110
Instead, on the days when
you make a lot of money,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.910
why might you stop?

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.160
Yes?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.705
AUDIENCE: You
might have a target

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:57.080
that you expect to meet every
day to cover your expenses.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.210
And if you feel like the work
[INAUDIBLE] reach that target,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.142
you might [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:02.142 --> 00:16:03.100
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.740
So if you target,
your reference point,

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.470
is essentially a
certain number, you

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.750
might reach that target
quickly because your wage

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.232
is pretty high on that day.

00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:12.690
And once you reach
that target, you

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.640
might say, well,
now utility function

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.758
is relatively not
very steep anymore

00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:18.300
relative to being
in the loss domain.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.500
So it's flatter.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.840
So then you might just
stop relatively soon

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.590
because, essentially, any
marginal earnings are not

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.900
really valuable for you anymore.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.560
OK?

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.180
Any questions on
that or comments?

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.372
So why do we want the wage
changes to be temporary here?

00:16:39.372 --> 00:16:41.080
What's an issue here
when you sort of try

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.360
to look at this in the data?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.110
Suppose I had
persistent wage changes.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.610
Yeah.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.713
AUDIENCE: So you can have
a frame of reference?

00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:49.630
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.630
You want to kind of keep
the reference constant.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.423
So in some sense, if wage
changes are permanent,

00:16:54.423 --> 00:16:56.090
then you get essentially
income effects.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.610
You'll be a lot richer overall.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.465
If they're only
temporary, essentially,

00:16:59.465 --> 00:17:01.840
you can sort of argue that,
essentially, your expectation

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.050
should be the same.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.567
And once you reach, once
you have a lot more money,

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.150
the neoclassical
model should actually

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.020
say that there should
be income affects.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.910
Essentially, the
neoclassical model says,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.190
you should essentially aggregate
all of your income and say,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.023
it doesn't really matter
whether you earn it

00:17:17.023 --> 00:17:19.119
on Monday, or Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.640
You should look at how much
are you earning overall

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.609
depending whether you
earn sufficiently much,

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.130
you're going to work
fewer or more hours.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.520
Now, if you earn a lot, because
your wages doubles or whatever,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.230
you might actually
work few hours

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.655
not because you reach a
reference point on a given day.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:36.280
It's just because
you got a lot richer,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.697
and then you decide
it's not worth

00:17:37.697 --> 00:17:38.837
for you to work that much.

00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:40.420
So we're kind of
trying to avoid that.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.450
We're trying to have only
temporary changes, which

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.173
is to say, for given wealth
overall on any given day,

00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:49.090
it shouldn't matter
whether you earn the money

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.630
on Monday or on Tuesday.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.575
So essentially, if
the wage happens

00:17:52.575 --> 00:17:53.950
to be really high
on Tuesday, you

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.260
should be working more,
earning more, on Tuesday

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.055
as opposed to on Monday.

00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:00.430
Now, what I was saying is, if
you're reference dependent,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.990
you might actually
care about this.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.240
You might care about on Monday
you didn't reach your target.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.740
Therefore, you
want to work more.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.290
On Tuesday, you reached
your target very quickly.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.280
And you work less even
though the wage is actually

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.810
really high.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.190
OK.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.170
Now, strategy one
might be optimal even

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.587
in the neoclassical model
if effort costs are convex.

00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:25.420
This is what I was
saying is, if it's really

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.580
sort of costly for you to
work 9 hours, you might say,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.697
I always work 8 hours.

00:18:31.697 --> 00:18:34.030
I want to have a certain
amount of money for my children

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.673
and so on.

00:18:35.673 --> 00:18:37.840
So the extra hour, if that's
really, really painful,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.945
you might not want to do that.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:41.320
We don't think
that's necessarily

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.913
the case in so many situations.

00:18:44.913 --> 00:18:46.330
The question is,
can we really say

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.413
that strategy three--
that's the strategy of doing

00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:50.650
the opposite, of working
essentially a lot of hours

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.560
when wages are low and few
hours when wages are high.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.610
Can we really say
it's a mistake?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.120
Well, it depends on kind of
whether the effort costs are

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.450
correlated with wages.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.120
So if cab drivers,
for example, make

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.630
really high wages on some days
and low wages on other days,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:09.700
it could just be on low
wage day it's much less

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.390
effortful to drive around.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.210
So you would do more hours.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.398
It turns out, when you
actually ask cab drivers,

00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:16.690
they actually prefer busy days.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.640
They actually prefer it
when there are customers as

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.710
opposed to just driving
around and looking for people.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.335
So we don't think
that's actually true.

00:19:22.335 --> 00:19:25.750
But in principle, you would
have to sort think about that.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.230
Now, there's a long literature
starting with Camerer et al.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.570
On cab drivers.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.490
A lot of that
essentially is pre-Uber,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.180
like collecting trip
shifts from cab drivers.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.830
Now, there's lots
of like Uber data

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.303
that's essentially much
more powerful in some ways.

00:19:41.303 --> 00:19:43.720
So there will be probably more
papers using Uber and Lyft,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.720
et cetera, data on that.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.370
But what Camerer et
al. did at the time

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.790
was they essentially
looked at typical cab

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.670
drivers that rent their cab
for 12 hour periods for a fixed

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.540
fee.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.820
And within this 12
hour window, a driver

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.260
can choose their hours freely.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.030
So you just get your
cab that's not yours.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.960
You rent it for the day.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.043
And then you can essentially
choose how many hours

00:20:04.043 --> 00:20:04.960
you want to work.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.230
And their wages, how much money
they make in any given hour,

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.226
varies by a lot.

00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:14.200
The weather varies, the
subway breakdowns, conferences

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.170
and so on and so forth.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.128
There's lots of variation
in how much money you

00:20:17.128 --> 00:20:19.540
make on a given day.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.120
So then they have trip
sheets that look at how long

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.460
cab drivers work and
their overall earnings.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.760
And so they can essentially
back out the wages from each day

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.880
and then look at like how
much do people work on days

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.230
when wages are high versus
days when wages are low.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.280
And then they essentially
find the basic finding.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.363
And that's a finding that's
sort of been contested

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.070
in the literature many people
have found or confirmed

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.850
subsequently.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.933
And others have not, but
I think eventually people

00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:46.780
have sort of settled on this.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.360
Hours are negatively
correlated with wages.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.810
So when wages in particular
are unexpectedly high,

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.600
cab drivers tend to
work fewer hours.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.750
And again, this is not
for permanent changes,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.160
but for transitory changes.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.250
Surprisingly, on a given
day people get more money,

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.390
then drivers work few hours.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.360
And that's very hard to explain
for the neoclassical model.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.758
Because, essentially,
you shouldn't care about

00:21:12.758 --> 00:21:14.800
whether you make the money
on Monday, on Tuesday.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.500
As I said, you should care about
how much money you make overall

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.140
and how many hours you work.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.940
And so it's very
hard to explain this.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.620
And sort of the explanation that
Camerer et al. and others were

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.750
testing or arguing
is essentially

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.552
this has to do with
reference dependence.

00:21:31.552 --> 00:21:34.010
And so what's being evaluated
in a reference dependent way?

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.040
Or how do we think about this?

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.540
Yeah.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.880
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.810
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.420
AUDIENCE: How did they
rule out the possibility

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.990
that maybe there is
reverse causality maybe

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.630
on a day where none
of the cab drivers

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.850
want to work that much
because it's supply and demand

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.725
that they just go on?

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.640
FRANK SCHILBACH: So that's
to say effort costs are high.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.040
So usually, it's to
do with other drivers.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.772
So let me actually
get through-- so let

00:22:03.772 --> 00:22:04.980
me defer this for one second.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.750
I have a slide on confounds.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.790
And then we can see the
rest of your question

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.510
and then get back to that.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.220
But that's a good question.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.292
So what is being evaluated
in reference-dependent way?

00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:18.750
What are people
looking at in terms

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.610
of where's the reference
point in the evaluation here?

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.870
Yes.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.320
AUDIENCE: I guess, if you're
a cab driver, you kind of say,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.510
oh, I want to make
this much money today.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.700
And then you just
kind of work until you

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.250
feel like you've made enough,
and then you just stop.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.040
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right, exactly.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.822
You have to pay your
fixed fee for the day

00:22:37.822 --> 00:22:39.030
or for the month or whatever.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.783
But there's an implicit
fixed fee for the day.

00:22:41.783 --> 00:22:43.950
So you kind of want to make
at least that much money

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.180
to make not a loss.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.820
You probably have some positive
target in some way in saying,

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.740
like, I want to make
pay back for my fee plus

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.500
you want to make some
money for the day and minus

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.820
sort of expenses.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.970
And once you reach that target,
you are in the gain domain.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.940
Below that, you are in
the loss domain, right?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.740
And so the daily
income essentially--

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.190
and that's essentially sort
of money after paying back

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.660
the fee, but you
could also get--

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.658
it's essentially
what's being evaluated

00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:13.950
in the reference-dependent way.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.320
What's the reference
point is some daily target

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.340
that you have.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.160
Often, it's expectation
and so on and sort of,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.708
essentially, how much
you think you will make.

00:23:22.708 --> 00:23:24.750
And then what's the feature
of the value function

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.680
that explains the phenomenon?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.722
Well, it's loss aversion.

00:23:26.722 --> 00:23:29.580
If you're falling short
of the target, essentially

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.710
your marginal utility--

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.080
when you drive another
hour or another trip,

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.500
the marginal utility that you
get, since the value function

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.360
is very steep below the target--

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.470
is very high.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.510
Once you reach the
target, it's very flat.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.555
And then essentially
you tend to stop.

00:23:45.555 --> 00:23:46.430
Does that make sense?

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.120
FRANK SCHILBACH: OK, great.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.170
So the main takeaway
is, so if drivers often

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.630
stop at their daily
income target,

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.780
driver with a higher wage
reach their targets faster.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.920
And they work fewer hours.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.690
Again, that's variation
within drivers across days.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.530
And sort of there's lots of
subsequent work and debate

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.670
regarding this finding.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.330
The debate is still ongoing.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.230
For example, one recent
paper looks at tips

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.460
that drivers get unexpectedly.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.480
So sometimes drivers get large
tips, sometimes get small tips.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.447
It depends a lot when in the
day they receive the tip,

00:24:21.447 --> 00:24:23.280
if they receive it
really early versus late,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.810
if they sort of get
to their target.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.185
And essentially,
the target seems

00:24:26.185 --> 00:24:27.300
to be adjusting over time.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.550
But overall-- and this is
sort of getting a little bit

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.725
at your question--

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.800
we think it's not sort
of aggregate supply.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.470
But the debate is still ongoing.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.260
But overall, we sort of think
that lots of labor supply

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.230
decisions, when people
have daily decisions of how

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.750
many hours to work
and their wages vary,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.800
depend on reference points
and might sort of potentially

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.780
be at least suboptimal.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.320
Or put differently, people
could work fewer hours

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.230
and try to sort of adjust
their overall amounts.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.230
For a while, I did this.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.160
You can ask your
Uber and Lyft drivers

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.230
what they're doing
and so on and see

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.148
whether they're a
reference-dependent driver,

00:25:07.148 --> 00:25:08.940
sort of where they have
reference-dependent

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.050
preferences.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.480
Now, what are sort of potential
alternative hypotheses?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.780
One question, one issue, could
be liquidity constraints.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.330
This is, for example, if you
just don't have enough cash.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.755
If you have to pay back
your fee for the day

00:25:20.755 --> 00:25:23.130
or for the next day, you might
want to not work only very

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.110
few hours on a given day.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.390
It turns out that drivers
who own their own medallion

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.430
exhibit the same patterns.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.940
There could be
things like fatigue.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.600
Let's just say it's really
tedious to work on certain days

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.860
when wages are high.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.620
We don't think that's going
on in part because drivers

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.170
themselves, they say,
it's actually easier

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.890
to drive with more passengers.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.920
Again, recent papers,
in fact, can also

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.100
control for this and so on.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.462
So we don't think
it's actually fatigue.

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:49.170
And this is, I think,
what you're saying.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.510
The last one is
unobserved shocks, so some

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.490
shocks that affect all drivers'
labor supply at the same time.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.770
Example, there are some days in
which all drivers get the flu.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.820
Fewer drivers will work.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.760
And those who will
work work fewer hours.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:09.330
And those who work
get higher wages.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.630
That's a little bit trickier
for them to rule out.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.450
In part, there's other papers,
other studies afterwards,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.310
that sort of try to get at this.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:23.040
Usually, yeah, for this specific
data, that's hard to do.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.000
I think for the other data where
people have essentially not

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.542
just daily--

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:30.000
so this is essentially
trip sheets.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.150
So what they're using mostly
is daily wages overall.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.410
They don't even have the wage.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:40.207
They only have the overall
earnings and then the hours.

00:26:40.207 --> 00:26:41.790
And then they sort
of compute the wage

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.220
dividing the two, which
causes some other trouble.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.020
But once you have
Uber data, once you

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.180
have specific trips and
particular also tips

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.870
and so on, you can look
at, on a given day when

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.630
I get a high tip
versus a low tip,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.380
you can predict,
essentially, how much I'm

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.588
going to earn on a given day.

00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:01.590
So suppose you
predict that I'm going

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.530
to earn $100 in a given day.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.110
Now, I have, say, $50 or $60.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.810
Now, I get a large trip
and a tip and so on that

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.050
gets me over that threshold.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.630
You can look at whether I stop.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.250
You can look at the
exact same thing.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.530
When I have only $20 and I get a
large tip, do I stop and so on?

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.810
So you can essentially
control for all of that

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.110
and then do within
driver comparisons,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.530
like for trips that happen
to be large or small that you

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.910
happen to get in a given hour.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.902
And then you can sort of deal
with overall market conditions.

00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:31.360
I think even better,
in the future,

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.735
there will be sort
of experiments

00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:37.230
and so on where you can look
at when Uber and Lyft try

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.930
to incentivize their
workers and so just,

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.012
say, essentially, sometimes pay
people more and less randomly,

00:27:44.012 --> 00:27:45.720
sort of explicitly
randomly, because they

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.330
want to kind of learn about
how to best incentivize

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.195
their drivers.

00:27:49.195 --> 00:27:50.820
And then you can
control for everything

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.940
because it's explicitly random
whether a certain driver gets

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.800
high versus low wages
or sort of trip fares.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.380
Yeah.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.030
OK.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:09.650
Any questions on
the labor supply?

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.457
Yes.

00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:13.790
AUDIENCE: I'm a bit confused
about the unobserved shock.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.450
Because if you get
a really large tip,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:20.205
that doesn't necessarily predict
that the rest of the day you'd

00:28:20.205 --> 00:28:22.085
have higher wages
if you kept working.

00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:23.793
[INAUDIBLE] you get
this really high tip,

00:28:23.793 --> 00:28:25.960
and then you would be like,
oh, today's a lucky day.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960
I can stop early.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.460
But if I have worked
more this day,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.492
I wouldn't necessarily be making
continuously more than normal.

00:28:31.492 --> 00:28:32.450
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.790
So in the unobserved, in
the large tip example,

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.310
the assumption is exactly--

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.660
or what they show in the paper.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.760
This is subsequent work,
not this specific work.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.460
What they exactly show
in this type of paper,

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.793
these are sort of random events.

00:28:43.793 --> 00:28:45.770
In a sense, it's
precisely not predictive

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.290
of your future earnings.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.310
It's random.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.990
Now, one interpretation
that you have is to say,

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.380
well, it could be that you
kind of have some expectations

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.605
about your future earnings.

00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:57.230
They could be
particularly high or low.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.180
It's like, I got my lucky
day and so on and so forth.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.310
That is hard to rule out.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.190
In some sense, if you had
rational expectations,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.310
that's hard to explain for
the neoclassical model.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.390
What's harder to rule
out is to say, you know,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.717
I now think I got my
lucky draw for the day.

00:29:10.717 --> 00:29:11.300
And that's it.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.030
And I'm not going to get
any lucky draw again.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.620
Let's just call it a day.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.160
That is hard to rule out.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.390
But what is hard to explain
for the neoclassical model--

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.210
I think we can sort
of reject-- is to say,

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.040
if you just think
this is a shock, which

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.350
really in reality it is
and you just happened

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:32.180
to get a bunch of money on
a given day just randomly,

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.100
then the reference-dependent
model can sort of

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.480
explain why you stop early.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.960
Because it just gets you
over the reference point.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.210
The neoclassical
model should just say,

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.057
depends on essentially
how many hours

00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:44.390
you want to work on a given day.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.010
It's nothing to
do with a target.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.270
Because essentially,
again, it doesn't

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.740
matter whether you
make money on Monday,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.670
or Tuesday, or Wednesday.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.920
You should just care about
the overall amount of money

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.720
that you make overall.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.090
But that's a good question.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.870
OK.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.870
So now, a second paper
is on the housing market.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.470
So what is the natural reference
point for housing market?

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.340
Or how do we think
about housing prices?

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.630
Or how do you think about--

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.700
I guess a few of you
will own a house.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.400
But if you owned
a house, how would

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.950
you think about selling a house?

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.070
What is an actual
reference point?

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.940
Yes?

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.438
AUDIENCE: Whatever it was
before or how [? changes ?]

00:30:22.438 --> 00:30:23.353
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:23.353 --> 00:30:24.770
FRANK SCHILBACH:
Yeah, so exactly.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.080
So the previous
purchase price, it

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.630
turns out it's a very, very
salient thing for owners.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.180
People really know how much
they paid for their house.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.040
It's a huge expense
in their life.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.245
They really remember it
was like 300,00, 500,000,

00:30:37.245 --> 00:30:38.120
a million, et cetera.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.890
They know exactly
how much they paid.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.640
And when you even ask people,
the majority of people

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.370
know exactly how much
they paid for their home.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.140
Now, one claim is
that loss aversion

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.660
makes people unwilling to
sell their houses at a loss.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.620
And so what they would then
do is they ask essentially

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.920
for higher prices, if a loss,
relative to their purchase

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.420
price.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.920
And let me just show you
exactly what I mean by that.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.250
Genesove and Mayer have
Boston condominium data

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.720
from 1992 in 1997.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.660
Luckily for them, there's lots
of variation or fluctuations

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.285
in the housing market
during that time.

00:31:16.285 --> 00:31:17.785
So the housing
market went up a lot,

00:31:17.785 --> 00:31:19.730
and then it went down a
lot and went up a lot.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.420
Now, suppose you have two
sellers, A and B, who both want

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.660
to sell their home in 1994.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.540
Now, what we can do is we
can look at these two people.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.580
Suppose they have
very similar houses

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.220
based on observable
characteristics and location

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.280
and so on and so forth.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.880
So once they have really
comparable houses,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:44.720
we can all look at seller A,
purchased their home really

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.975
early on, in 1989.

00:31:45.975 --> 00:31:48.350
That person happens to be
quite unlucky because they just

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.650
bought the house really
at the peak of, I guess,

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.150
the housing boom at the time.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:58.130
Or seller number B, who
purchased in 1991, that person

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.180
was relatively lucky.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.820
They bought
essentially at a time

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.510
when the housing market was
relatively low and appreciated

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.600
quite a bit.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.940
So now, we can look at these
two people and ask the question,

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.510
is seller A or seller B more
likely to sell their house?

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.720
And the hypothesis is
that seller A will sort of

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.100
view this as a loss.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.190
This seller will essentially
just say I'm losing money here.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.390
I don't want to sell.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.800
And that seller
might essentially

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.990
ask for a higher
listing price and wants

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.240
make more money for this
house because they don't want

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.300
to make a loss on that sale.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.910
Well, seller B says, I'm
actually gaining money anyway.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.287
So let's just sort of
post whatever you think

00:32:37.287 --> 00:32:38.870
is actually the
expected market price.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.420
I might be happy to sell
at a lower price compared

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.040
to seller A.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.550
OK.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.008
So one thing we can look at
essentially are listing prices.

00:32:46.008 --> 00:32:48.050
How much do people
want for the houses?

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.630
The second thing they can look
at is actual sales prices.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.170
Are you now selling this
at a higher or lower price?

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.270
And number three, we
can look at how long

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.930
is the house on the market.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.510
How long does it
actually take to sell it?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.060
That's a quite
costly thing to do

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.143
to have your house on the
market for quite a while

00:33:04.143 --> 00:33:07.160
because, essentially, often
people then don't already

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.090
move somewhere else.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.500
Or they can't really
live in the house

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.500
because they have to sort
of show it and make it

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.170
available for
showings and so on.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.420
So it's a costly thing to do.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.670
You really don't want to
have your house on the market

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.860
for several months.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.480
But is sort of the
broad idea clear

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.605
of what we're trying to do?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.190
OK.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.833
So what predictions
do we want to test?

00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:31.500
We want to test whether
house owners are

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.290
reluctant to sell their house
when the current market price

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.970
is below the purchase price.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.910
So the ideal specification
is essentially the following.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.540
We look at the list price
on the left-hand side.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.300
And then we are going to run a
regression that looks at some

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.270
constant-- that's just kind
of time trends, et cetera--

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.270
plus a beta, which is the
coefficient of interest.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.010
Or one coefficient of interest
is of the actual market price.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.680
How much is the thing worth?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.610
And then delta on the loss is
how much do you lose relative

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.520
to your purchase price.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.087
Now, if people were not
reference-dependent,

00:34:05.087 --> 00:34:05.920
what should we find?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.090
Or what would be
the predictions?

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.280
The neoclassical model,
what should we find here?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.780
Yes.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.195
AUDIENCE: We should find
that delta 0 [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:21.248 --> 00:34:22.290
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.340
Delta should not matter.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.880
It shouldn't matter how much you
lost or gained in that house.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.219
What should matter is what
is the actual market value.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.250
You should essentially try
to be willing to sell it not.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.949
Beta could be-- it
doesn't have to be 1.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.813
It could be everybody pays
above the actual market.

00:34:37.813 --> 00:34:39.480
There's some housing
bubble or whatever.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.853
Beta could be 1.1 or
whatever you might be.

00:34:42.853 --> 00:34:45.270
That depends on, essentially,
sort of aggregate conditions

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.170
and so on.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.300
But delta really
should not matter.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.800
When I'm trying to
sell you a house,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.350
you should ask, what's
the actual market value?

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.210
And I should,
essentially, then based

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.740
on that, put it on a market
on that listing price.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.160
But what might be the case is
that the loss actually matters.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.670
Now, one problem here is that
the actual market value is not

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.963
observable, right?

00:35:06.963 --> 00:35:08.880
So I don't actually know
what the market value

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.440
is because that's endogenous.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.410
That's part of the transaction.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.500
So what can I do instead?

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.340
Or how do I do this?

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.160
Yes.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.920
AUDIENCE: By asking people,
would you take this trade?

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.130
And then see what they say.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:27.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.190
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.830
So you can look at actually
the market outcome overall.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.690
You can look at who
buys it and what's

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.460
the actual purchase price.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.130
Now, that might also be
endogenous to the listing

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.760
price, right?

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.093
So if you think you know that
people who are loss averse

00:35:40.093 --> 00:35:43.280
are listing their houses
too high relatively compared

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.590
to what the market
value actually is,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.910
it might actually be
sold at a higher price.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.330
So that's hard to interpret.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.870
It could just be that, if you
list it at a very high price

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.870
and wait for a long time, you
also sell it at a higher price.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.245
But it doesn't mean that that's
actually worth that much.

00:35:59.245 --> 00:36:02.870
It just means that you happen
to find a buyer who happens

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.400
to be willing to pay a lot.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.248
And that's more likely when
you wait for a long time, which

00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:09.290
is not necessarily optimal,
because it's actually

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.460
quite costly to do that.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.923
But you're saying something
else which is asking them

00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:14.840
about what they think.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.850
But what are the characteristics
that we could look at?

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.380
Or what data could we look at?

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.340
If you had Zillow data or
data on essentially a bunch

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.400
of these apps where
you can look at houses,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.400
what data could you get?

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:29.970
Yes.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.450
AUDIENCE: You'd
look at the houses

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.938
in the neighborhood, similar
houses that sold recently.

00:36:33.938 --> 00:36:34.980
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.485
What Redfin and
Zillow, et cetera,

00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:37.860
do these days is
essentially they

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.610
have these algorithms that try
to predict the actual market

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.660
sales price.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.190
And what they tend
to do essentially

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.530
is look at, exactly as
you say, surrounding

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.747
houses that are similar
in some characteristics.

00:36:50.747 --> 00:36:52.080
They look at the square footage.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.980
They look at the number of
bathrooms and rooms in general.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.960
They look at sort of location
and so on and so forth.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.330
And then you can
predict how much--

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.760
and sort of they look at all
the time trends and so on.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.350
How much is the
actual market value?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.110
But essentially, fundamentally,
it's a prediction exercise.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.330
You can try to predict
what the actual value is.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.600
And that's exactly what
Genesove and Mayer do.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.730
They do some more
fancy things that

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.850
try to get it other unobservable
characteristics and so on.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.330
But the essence of this is
exactly the prediction exercise

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.527
where they say, let's just
look at the characteristics

00:37:27.527 --> 00:37:28.110
of this house.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.290
Let's try to predict what
the market value is and then

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.948
look at the loss,
which is essentially

00:37:32.948 --> 00:37:34.740
the difference between
the previous selling

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.810
price and the
expected selling price

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.690
truncated from 0 because,
otherwise, it's a gain.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.670
And then we can look
at does it really

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.070
seem that, when people
are in the loss domain,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.910
when their loss is positive,
are they now selling their house

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.320
or trying to sell their
house at a higher price?

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.170
Yes?

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.920
AUDIENCE: How do you
account for something

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.250
like recent renovations
since the last listing

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.980
and relative to any
other similar units

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:03.422
or houses or [INAUDIBLE]
[? nearby ?] [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:03.422 --> 00:38:04.380
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.242
So that's tricky to do.

00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:08.200
And I don't think they
have this in their data.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.540
So what you'd have
to assume here,

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.950
and that's perhaps
reasonable, is

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.470
to say that when you look
at sort of this picture

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.200
that seller A and
seller B did not

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.450
do differential
renovation depending

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.680
on when they bought the house.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.210
Right?

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.210
So if you said, it's fine if
people have done renovations.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.920
For example, this
is what I was saying

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.260
about the beta on the
actual market value.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.900
If you systematically
underestimate or overestimate

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.720
how much people renovate and so
on, or maybe the housing market

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.140
is really hot or
whatever, that's OK.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.580
The main issue is that can't be
correlated with the loss here.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.600
So if it's the case that people
who lost a bunch of money

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.810
in terms of their housing
prices sort of tanked,

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.460
if those people have
done more or less

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:55.620
renovations, then you're in
trouble with your estimates.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.370
Yeah.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.775
AUDIENCE: Is the expected
selling price the estimation

00:38:58.775 --> 00:39:00.668
of actual [? work ?] value?

00:39:00.668 --> 00:39:01.710
FRANK SCHILBACH: Correct.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:02.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.155
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.170
So now, what Genesove
and Mayer find

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.810
is-- and there's
more detail to that.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.393
But essentially, the
main finding is--

00:39:10.393 --> 00:39:12.870
and that's a fairly solid one,
there's a bunch of different

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.610
specifications--

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.228
a 10% increase in
a prospective loss.

00:39:17.228 --> 00:39:19.020
So if this loss
coefficient, the difference

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.670
between the expected selling
price and the purchase price,

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.730
if that's 10% higher, then
essentially the list price

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.770
is 2.5% to 3.5% higher.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.410
So people list the price,
the house, at a higher price.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.880
If the house is
at a loss compared

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.220
to a similar house
who's not at a loss

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.400
or who's in the gain
domain, these effects

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.120
then translate into higher
sales prices and a lower hazard

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.140
rate of sale.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.480
That's to say people actually
sell it at a higher price.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.650
So in fact, it's hard to say
here what's optimal versus not.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.320
It could be that,
overall, people are like,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.940
it's actually a
good thing to do.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.370
That depends a lot on,
essentially, your opportunity

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:03.840
costs of money in
terms how costly is it

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.580
for you to keep the house
on the market for a while.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.190
But essentially, people have
a lower hazard right of sale.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.050
That's to say it just takes them
a lot longer to sell the house.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.930
That tends to be
very costly to do.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:19.163
But if you just otherwise would
have your money in the bank

00:40:19.163 --> 00:40:20.580
and you have another
place to stay

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.820
and you don't really care,
maybe then that's fine.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.620
But we surely have real
effects in terms of people

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.780
list their houses
at higher prices.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.030
People sell them at
somewhat higher prices.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.720
And people also keep them
longer on the market.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.410
OK.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.280
Yeah.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.738
AUDIENCE: Is this
the same analysis

00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:42.165
if it's gains on the
value of the house?

00:40:44.748 --> 00:40:46.790
FRANK SCHILBACH: So
essentially, what we're doing

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:51.360
is we implicitly comparing
losses versus gains, right?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.470
So the gains here would be
in the actual market value

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.900
already as it is.

00:41:02.358 --> 00:41:04.400
But essentially, what
you're implicitly doing is,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.980
when comparing implicitly,
this is what I was saying here.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.010
When you look at this picture,
implicitly what we're doing

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.700
is we look at people who are
losing money compared to people

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.080
who are gaining money.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.715
And explicitly or
implicitly, we're

00:41:16.715 --> 00:41:18.350
asking, is the
increase and the gain

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.264
sort of predictive of that--

00:41:20.264 --> 00:41:22.610
sorry, the increase in
the losses predictive

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.110
of your listing price?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.890
Now, it's hard to do this
at the same time for gains

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.770
because, essentially, an
increase in the market price

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.550
overall that's
sort of collinear.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.120
In [INAUDIBLE],, essentially
that's hard to separate.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.763
You could do the same
analysis, and you

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:40.430
wouldn't find that
for the gains in part

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.388
because essentially
explicitly what we're doing

00:41:42.388 --> 00:41:46.080
is incurring losses to gains.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.580
OK.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.460
OK.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.210
So then there is another
piece of evidence

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.230
that sort of tells us
perhaps this is not optimal.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.057
If you look at people who
are owner-occupied compared

00:41:57.057 --> 00:41:58.640
to investors-- so
there are people who

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.840
essentially invest in houses.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.715
And they sell houses.

00:42:00.715 --> 00:42:02.930
And they sell lots
of houses over time.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.410
Those people have much
lower endowment effect,

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.730
if you want, for houses.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.580
So they exhibit this
behavior a lot less.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.290
But people who live
in that house, who

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.940
bought that house,
for them it's mostly

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.107
the only house they live in.

00:42:15.107 --> 00:42:16.760
It's the main purchase
that they have.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.400
For them, it's essentially
their house for which

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.420
they don't want to make losses.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.340
For them, these effects
are twice as large

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.410
compared to the investors.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.200
And that's perhaps some
evidence that this is not

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.240
optimal behavior
in a sense of sort

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.830
of the professional investors.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.930
They presumably know pretty
well how to price their houses.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.560
So if they do this
behavior less,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.840
presumably that's
a sign that there's

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.160
some form of a
mistake here going on.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.520
Second, there's some evidence--
and John List has some work

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.780
on this overall--

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.360
to say that experience
can mitigate

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.980
reference dependent effects.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.200
Essentially, if you
do a lot of trading,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.030
if you sell a lot
of houses and so on,

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:03.230
then you might still
feel losses and gains,

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.750
but you might sort of have a
lot more experience with this.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.940
You kind of know that this
is happening sometimes.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.250
And you might be less prone
to these types of effects

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.100
because you kind of know that
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.150
You shouldn't sort of have your
feelings of losses and gains

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.920
get in the way of
making profits.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.337
So there are some
people who would

00:43:20.337 --> 00:43:22.760
argue that this is very
much consistent with markets

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.430
over time or
exposures to markets

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.430
and several predictions.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.730
Experience makes some of
these effects go away.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.830
And John List has
some separate evidence

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.530
on this on traders
of cards and so on.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.703
OK.

00:43:37.703 --> 00:43:39.620
So now, next, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.310
about finance and stocks.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.540
So interestingly-- yeah.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.495
AUDIENCE: Sorry, on
the previous study,

00:43:46.495 --> 00:43:48.746
why [? is it ?] said
reference-dependent and not

00:43:48.746 --> 00:43:54.390
some informational effect,
that I'm a home owner

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.100
and I think that my house
is worth this amount.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.210
And I just [INAUDIBLE]
[? anchored ?]

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.252
to believing that
that's the amount.

00:44:01.252 --> 00:44:02.210
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:07.860
So one thing you
could say is that--

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.890
so what you always have
to make the argument

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.870
is people who are at losses
compared to who are at gains.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:15.620
So you look at our
investor A and B.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.540
They might have additional
information on how much

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.500
the house is worth.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.350
So it could be, for
example, that seller A

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.860
knows a lot about this house.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.510
It's very beautiful and so
much light and this and that.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.623
And, therefore, they paid a lot.

00:44:31.623 --> 00:44:33.290
Therefore, they have
private information

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.560
that it's worth a lot.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.340
Therefore, they list it
at a really high price.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.280
So there are some specification
here that-- look at this.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.520
What you see is this is
columns two, four, and six,

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.760
which is the residual
from the last sales price.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.720
What is that?

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.540
That's essentially the
difference between at the time

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.758
when previously
the house was sold,

00:44:52.758 --> 00:44:54.800
what was the prediction
of the market price then,

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.040
and how much was it sold.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:01.580
So it's kind of like, how much
did you overpay, if you want,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.830
relative to what we
expected at the time?

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.230
Presumably, that's
reflective and, again,

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.950
using the same
prediction method.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:08.900
So if you thought,
you know, it's

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.400
really beautiful and lots of
windows and this and that, lots

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.300
of light, and really
quiet and so on,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.270
if you overpaid
at the time, that

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.500
should then sort of be
predictive of the listing

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.160
price.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.280
And sort of controlling for that
then should make this go away.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.280
What you see, however, there's
some of that perhaps going on.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.650
If you compare, for example,
columns one and two,

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.690
you see that the effect
goes down a little bit.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.190
But it's still
there quite a bit.

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.280
This is why I was
saying 25% to 35%.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.900
That is exactly right.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.800
That's a big concern.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.180
And there's a bunch
of sort of robustness,

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.070
et cetera, checks in
this specific study.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.150
But that's exactly right.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.220
There could be sort of
unobservable information

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.670
that the owner might have
about the house that is not

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.540
in Zillow or in
any sort of Redfin,

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.410
et cetera, predictions that's
available for the public.

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.140
That's a great question, but
I think it's, to the extent

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.810
that that takes care of
it, sort of the authors

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.730
have thought about that.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:59.930
Yes.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.670
AUDIENCE: On the
following slide,

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:05.070
when you talk about
the differences,

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.160
how do you control
for the selection bias

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.930
about the people that may be the
ones repeatedly selling houses

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.090
exhibit this less
and, therefore, stay

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.460
in the market versus a change
in those individuals' behavior?

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:21.110
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.110
That's a great question.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.740
So the question you're asking
is essentially to say--

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.790
and it's, in fact, a
great sort of segue

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.830
into behavioral finance,
which is to say,

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.350
suppose there are some people
who are really sophisticated.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.200
They don't have certain
behavioral biases.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.790
Maybe they're not loss averse.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.830
That makes you a
better investor, say.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.490
And, therefore, you stay
in the market overall.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.770
I think, from this
observation that I have here,

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:53.810
I cannot tell you is it
experience or is it selection.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:59.060
So the question kind of is,
when people are investors,

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.160
do the effects of
reference-dependence of gains

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.170
and losses go away over time?

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.510
Essentially, maybe the
first, second, third time

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.690
they feel really a loss in terms
of making a bad investment.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.900
But in house number 20, I'm
just like, that's as usual.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.910
And I shouldn't sort of
really care very much.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.440
Is it that this goes away?

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.840
Or is it that the people
who are particularly

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.940
loss averse and
sort of essentially

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.710
engage in this type
of behavior in terms

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.510
of listing too high
of a price for losses,

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.090
these are sort of bad investor
in the housing markets?

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.070
And they sort of are essentially
driven out of the market.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.070
So that specific
setting I don't think we

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.910
can necessarily
account for that.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:41.120
I think in the
studies by John List,

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.900
it's very much people argue
it's about experience.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.060
But again, there also
some part could also

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.200
be selection I think.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.520
So I think, in some
sense, either way

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.370
I think the evidence that
the investors are doing

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.440
this behavior less sort
of tells us something

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.920
about this is probably
not at least financially

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.460
optimal for you to engage
in this type of behavior.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.840
It might be privately optimal.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.215
In some sense, if
you really feel

00:48:11.215 --> 00:48:14.100
at selling your
house at a loss, you

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.710
should probably list
it at a higher price

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.050
because that sort of
limits your losses.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.120
That's just what a utility
function looks like.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.330
It's not necessarily
suboptimal in the sense

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.000
of how you feel afterwards.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.760
It might be suboptimal in terms
of how much money you make

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.610
or how much money you have
eventually on how much

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.950
you pay for keeping
your house on the market

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:38.380
and so on for an
extended period of time.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.000
OK.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.250
So did that answer
your question?

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.690
Yeah, OK.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.760
So behavioral finance
is an interesting field

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.710
because, for quite
a while, economists

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.780
thought that sort of
neoclassical assumptions

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.930
are, in fact, most likely to
hold in financial markets.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.450
And why is that?

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.640
And some of this already
I mentioned, but why

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.160
are financial
markets particular--

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.910
why might one think
that financial markets

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.450
are particularly efficient?

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.740
Yes.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.990
AUDIENCE: Well, you might
think that financial markets

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.700
are very competitive.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.680
And so it's actually
the ones who

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:29.530
can get rid of their behavioral
biases that benefit the most

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.948
and stay within
financial market.

00:49:31.948 --> 00:49:32.990
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:36.680
So it's very much sort of the
Chicago economics assumption

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.400
is to say, so financial markets
are extremely competitive.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.848
If I'm an investor who has
various behavioral biases,

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.640
presumably I'm going
to lose some money one

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.690
way or the other.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:49.940
Well, if markets are
really competitive,

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.580
in the long run I cannot stay
in this market without sort

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.820
of being driven out.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.390
So essentially,
the market favors

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:01.052
sort of results-oriented,
rational, and selfish behavior.

00:50:01.052 --> 00:50:03.260
So people who are not rational
and so on and so forth

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.627
will be eliminated from
the market eventually.

00:50:05.627 --> 00:50:06.710
There's two parts to that.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.300
That's true across firms.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.100
That's to say there
are some firms

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.330
sort of better than others.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.220
But also, within a
firm, if I'm an investor

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.890
and I'm sort of advising
clients and the like-- and

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:17.510
I'm sort of not
very good at this.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.400
And essentially, I have
certain people biases

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.970
that are not optimal in terms
of making money for people.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.530
Presumably, I will
not be promoted.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.880
Presumably, I will be driven
out of or fired from the company

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.470
eventually.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.720
So surprisingly,
in fact, finance

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.940
became one of the most
influential and most fruitful

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.470
applications of the
psychology in economics

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:38.690
of behavioral economics.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.430
There's lots and lots of
work in behavioral finance.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:44.030
The reason being
perhaps not necessarily

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.123
because people are--

00:50:45.123 --> 00:50:46.790
so some people are
presumably driven out

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.860
of the market, but
surely not everyone.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.530
But in particular, because there
is a great data in finance.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.000
There's lots and lots of
daily data in terms of things

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.400
that you should
be doing compared

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.200
to what models would say.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.820
So it's a really
great way of being

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.220
able to test models
or test essentially

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.860
predictions of the neoclassical
model or behavioral theories

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.830
and so on.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:10.790
So that's why behavioral finance
has been very influential

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.920
because there's so much
data available for people

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.220
to, in fact, test theories.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.140
And then why is it that people
are not entirely driven out?

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.410
I think often the case is
that, even if you're right,

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.750
for example, even if you're
right that you can predict--

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:28.050
and if you watch some movies
on the financial crisis

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.430
and so on, even if you're
right about in the long run

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.500
the market is going to
tank, well, actually it's

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.730
going to take a lot of money.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.100
And often, if
everybody is wrong,

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.520
prices will go up
for quite a while.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.420
So it's not actually
clear that, at least

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.180
in the short, medium run, we'll
be driven out of the market

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:45.680
quickly.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.000
But that's sort of
a separate topic.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:49.750
OK.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.968
So now, one reason
why or one way

00:51:52.968 --> 00:51:54.760
in which reference-dependent
behavior might

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.250
be important in
finance is people

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:01.120
might be differentially likely
to sell winners and hold

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.910
on to losers, financial stocks.

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.690
That was mentioned
last time as well.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.160
So what Terry Odean did in
1997 is he had, in fact,

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.160
brokerage accounts from
the nationwide brokerage

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.090
house, which had all trades
and prices for, I guess, '87

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.080
to '93.

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.600
In some sense-- a little bit
old fashioned in a sense of you

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.150
shouldn't be an individual
trading and so on.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.670
You should just hold the
stock market or the S&P 500

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.410
or some index funds and so on.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:28.750
Here, these are people
who hold individual stocks

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.870
and sell and buy
them one by one.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.270
And so during each trading
day, then what Odean can do

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.910
is he can look at, evaluate,
each stock in the portfolio

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:41.137
and look at this is a loss
relative to the purchase price.

00:52:41.137 --> 00:52:43.720
So you can look at, essentially,
the portfolio and say there's

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.210
losers and winners.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.230
He only has data
on trading days.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.610
So you can look at are
they losers and winners

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:53.260
when they're being sold.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:58.210
And he can look at then at
realized gains and realized

00:52:58.210 --> 00:52:58.880
losses.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.570
So if you sell a stock
and it's essentially

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:07.360
above the purchase price,
he calls it a realized loss.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.490
Sorry, if it's a losing
stock, it's sold.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:10.420
It's a realized loss.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.740
It's below the purchase price.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.210
If it's above the
purchase price,

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.430
it's going to be
a realized gain.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.140
Now, one thing you
could do is compare

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.702
the number of realized losses
to the number of realized gains.

00:53:20.702 --> 00:53:22.660
Does that work, or is
that reference-dependent?

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.130
So what did we learn from that?

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:41.970
Yes.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
people [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.200
people won't want to
[INAUDIBLE] are losing stock

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.867
because they're comparing to the
price they bought [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:48.867 --> 00:53:49.825
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:53:49.825 --> 00:53:51.482
So I could look at
the realized gains

00:53:51.482 --> 00:53:53.940
and the number of realized
gains and the number of realized

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.870
losses.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.350
But what's the
problem with that?

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.747
That's exactly right, but
what's the underlying,

00:53:58.747 --> 00:54:00.330
what's the problem
with this approach?

00:54:05.802 --> 00:54:08.260
How does this depend on the
stock market going up and down?

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.590
Yes?

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:15.034
AUDIENCE: You're not looking
at the magnitude of those gains

00:54:15.034 --> 00:54:17.503
or losses?

00:54:17.503 --> 00:54:18.420
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.040
So that's a separate issue.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.900
You could look at the
magnitudes themselves.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.540
And you could look at,
depending on where you are,

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.980
how does that matter.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.980
But what about just a
number of gains and losses?

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.530
What if the stock
market goes up a lot?

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.081
What are people going
to sell or [INAUDIBLE]??

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.010
Yeah.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.400
AUDIENCE: Well, one issue
is that you don't know when

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.100
or for how long something
has been losing.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.725
So if it's been
losing for long time

00:54:45.725 --> 00:54:48.420
or gaining for a long time, that
might impact the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.057
hang onto it or sell it?

00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:51.640
FRANK SCHILBACH: So
he does have that.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.010
I think I'm asking for
something very basic, which

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:56.020
is, if the stock
market goes up a lot,

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.220
you'll have lots of winners.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.220
So you're going to realize
lots of-- if you just

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.940
sell randomly, stocks,
gains and losses,

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.775
and you just don't care, you'll
have much more realized gains

00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:06.400
compared to realized losses just
because your stock market went

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.240
up a lot.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.230
Similarly, if the
stock market went down,

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.040
you will find that people
have way more realized losses

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.487
compared to realize gains.

00:55:13.487 --> 00:55:15.820
And it looked like I'm really
trying to sell the losers,

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.695
but it's not I'm actually
selling the losers.

00:55:17.695 --> 00:55:19.690
I just have a lot more losers.

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:20.770
That's all I was asking.

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:23.187
I think he has actually the
information about the purchase

00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:23.740
prices.

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.700
So what he then does is
something very simple.

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.730
It just looks at people's
portfolios and says,

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:29.470
how many losing
stocks do you have?

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:32.080
What's your propensity to
sell the losing stocks, which

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.220
is what you call the PLR, the
Proportion of Losers Realized?

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:38.230
The same he does for
the PGR, which is

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:39.903
a Proportion of Gains Realized.

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:42.070
So he looks at each person
when they sell something.

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.070
They look at how many
losing stocks do you have.

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.670
How many winning
stocks do you have?

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.770
And then he looks at what's
the probability of you

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:52.340
selling any of those depending
on they're winners or losers.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.040
So what the main
finding then here

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.490
is that the PGR, the
Proportion of Gains Realized,

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.920
is larger than the PLR.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.410
And that's to say that's what
they call the disposition

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:05.200
effect, which is a tendency
to sell winners and hold on

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.040
to losers.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.760
Does that make sense?

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.300
OK.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.773
And so why do we
care about that?

00:56:10.773 --> 00:56:11.940
Or why is this actually bad?

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.465
Is it's necessarily
suboptimal behavior?

00:56:14.465 --> 00:56:15.090
Why do we care?

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:27.422
Yes.

00:56:27.422 --> 00:56:28.880
AUDIENCE: I think
you had mentioned

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.090
in a previous class
[INAUDIBLE] sometimes it

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:35.300
might be worthwhile to
hold on to the winners

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:39.236
or someone who's
betting on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:39.236 --> 00:56:42.070
But probably shouldn't
be an overall bias

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.990
towards selling losers.

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:47.700
And then probably [INAUDIBLE]
overall effective strategy

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:48.582
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:48.582 --> 00:56:49.540
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.310
So it depends on,
essentially, how well

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.320
the winners and the
losers are going to do.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.150
It turns out, so in
principle, you would say,

00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.220
well, winners and losers
should have the same expected

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.280
return regardless of the
winners and losers in the past.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.440
That's essentially the
efficient market hypothesis,

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.620
just to say past price
changes should just not

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.867
be predictive of future momentum
or price changes overall.

00:57:13.867 --> 00:57:16.450
Because the current price should
have incorporated essentially

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.742
all information that's
available at this point in time.

00:57:18.742 --> 00:57:21.325
So to that degree, it shouldn't
matter actually what you sell.

00:57:21.325 --> 00:57:23.048
You could just
randomly sell stuff.

00:57:23.048 --> 00:57:24.340
Now, you should not sell a lot.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.450
Usually, there's commissions
involved in these trades.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:27.867
So essentially,
you shouldn't sell

00:57:27.867 --> 00:57:30.783
anything that's essentially
leading to over-trading.

00:57:30.783 --> 00:57:32.200
Odean has another
paper that shows

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.700
essentially, in
particular, men tend

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.280
to be overconfident in how
good they are at trading.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.430
And they tend to over-trade,
and that's really costly.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:44.380
It turns out that, in
their specific period,

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.850
in fact there's momentum.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:48.513
And that used to be the case
quite a bit in that period

00:57:48.513 --> 00:57:50.680
of time, which essentially
has to do with the winner

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.480
is actually doing
better than the losers

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.430
by quite a big margin.

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:57.230
That is to say, you should
have actually did exactly

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.980
then the opposite.

00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.813
If anything, you should
have sold the losers

00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:02.650
and keep the winners because
they are, in fact, making

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:08.890
more money in the short and
medium run in that period, OK?

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:11.110
There's also the
investors sell more losers

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:12.277
and winners in December.

00:58:12.277 --> 00:58:13.360
This is what you see here.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.020
Why is that?

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.540
Yes.

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.530
AUDIENCE: Is it
that you can count

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:20.520
your losses toward your income?

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.603
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly,
this is for tax reasons.

00:58:22.603 --> 00:58:24.150
So that actually happens to--

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:26.310
Jim Poterba, who's in
the economics department,

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.020
actually did a paper on this.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.380
So there you can
essentially realize losses,

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:35.560
and that reduces
your taxes overall.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.060
Exactly.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.768
But overall, essentially
what's happening

00:58:37.768 --> 00:58:40.620
is that people do seem to
engage in this behavior.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.150
In a pretty striking
fashion, they

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:46.500
seem to be losing quite
a bit of money from that.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.190
OK.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.647
Let me mention at least the
marathon running and perhaps

00:58:50.647 --> 00:58:52.230
the golf example,
and then we're going

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:55.390
to move towards
prices and firms.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:57.045
How do firms react
to these biases?

00:58:57.045 --> 00:58:58.920
But what I'm trying to
do here is essentially

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.660
show you a bunch of
different settings.

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.430
And essentially, if you
look at different settings

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:04.770
in the world, there's lots
and lots of different settings

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.510
where reference-dependence
seems to matter.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.885
One way or the other, it seems
to be important in shaping

00:59:08.885 --> 00:59:10.180
people's behavior.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.740
So this is a very nice paper
about a marathon running

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.610
finishing times.

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:15.902
These are many, many marathons.

00:59:15.902 --> 00:59:18.970
They have lots of data on
finishing times for people.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:21.030
So the law of
large numbers would

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:23.790
predict that, if you look at
essentially people's finishing

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:27.510
times, if people have different
talents and so on and so forth,

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:30.040
the finishing times should
look something like this.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.540
OK.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.470
Some people are faster.

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:32.428
Some people are slower.

00:59:32.428 --> 00:59:36.668
But overall they're should be
some smooth distribution that

00:59:36.668 --> 00:59:39.210
essentially is like log normal
or whatever you want it to be.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:42.070
But essentially, it should
look something like this.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:43.950
So why might it
not look like this?

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:48.260
Or what might people do instead?

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.100
Yes.

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.080
AUDIENCE: They may
say, I'll beat 4:30.

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.770
And then you might see
bunching at certain points,

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:58.312
like 4 hours, 4:30,
5 hours, 5:30.

00:59:58.312 --> 00:59:59.270
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.430
So exactly as you
say, it might be

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.140
that people have
reference points

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.420
not in terms of status
quo here and the like.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.640
Reference points might
be goals or aspirations.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.460
You might say, I really want
to run the marathon in 4 hours

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.380
or 4:30 or 4 hours if you want.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.130
And then what the marathon
times actually look like

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:17.295
is something like this.

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:18.920
And in particular,
it seems like people

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.800
have lots of goals of
reaching something like--

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.890
if you look at the
distribution, what you see

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.380
is exactly as you predict.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.840
If you look at the
half hour or even

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.020
the quarter hour sort
of points, there's

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.070
essentially bunching from below.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.220
So essentially,
people seem to be,

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.540
if they're at pace to finish
at 4 hours and 1 minute,

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.027
they try to sort of speed
up and just make it to 3:59.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.100
So you see a bunch of bunching
at the half hour slots.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.558
You see actually much less
at 6 hours and 30 minutes

01:00:54.558 --> 01:00:55.100
or something.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.975
It seems that few people
have actually goals.

01:00:56.975 --> 01:00:59.413
Once you run the marathon
in 6 hours and 30 minutes,

01:00:59.413 --> 01:01:00.830
which is probably
what I would do,

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.872
you know, it doesn't really
matter whether you're

01:01:02.872 --> 01:01:04.825
like 6:31 or 6:29.

01:01:04.825 --> 01:01:06.200
But there's very
ambitious people

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.280
who want to like finish in 4:30,
4 hours, or 3:30 and the like.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.030
And there's a bunch of
bunching from below there.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.710
So you see the same for quarter
hour times, a little bit less

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:21.110
of that.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.360
And sort of that's consistent
with the reference point

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.733
here being a goal
and aspiration.

01:01:25.733 --> 01:01:26.900
You want to reach 4 minutes.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.460
You want to brag to
your friends and so on.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.050
And it's not so great
if you do that and say,

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:32.570
I finished in 4 hours and 1
minute as opposed to if you

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.690
say I finished below 4 hours.

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.130
Now, when you look at the effort
at the end of the race, what

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.880
would you expect?

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.910
So what we have here on
the x-axis is people.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.820
These are the 40 kilometer pace.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.010
These are in 30
second increments.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:57.860
So the marathon is
42.195 kilometers.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.770
So what I'm showing you
here is, essentially,

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.760
the 40 kilometer pace people
are ranked or distributed

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.310
by the 40 kilometer pace,
the first 40 kilometers.

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.160
Now, what you would
expect for people--

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.740
so there are some
people who were at pace

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:17.715
to reach 3:55 and some people
at pace to reach 4:05 and so on.

01:02:17.715 --> 01:02:19.340
What is it that you
would expect people

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.810
to do when you look at how fast
people run towards the last two

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:24.920
kilometers of the race?

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:31.880
Yes?

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.297
AUDIENCE: If they're
really close,

01:02:33.297 --> 01:02:35.938
they're going [INAUDIBLE]
especially hard.

01:02:35.938 --> 01:02:36.980
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.022
And this is what you see.

01:02:38.022 --> 01:02:39.670
So low means you're
running fast.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.740
This is minutes per
kilometer I think

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.570
or relative minutes
per kilometer.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.460
So what you should
expect is people

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.330
who are just below the goal or
people who are essentially just

01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.480
above the goal, in fact, these
are the people who speed up,

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.040
OK?

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.540
And this is exactly
what you sort of

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.180
see is that people who are
just below the 4 minute mark

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.020
or some people who are
just above, they speed up

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.820
to just make it to that goal.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.320
And sort of Allen et al.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.270
Have a sort of analysis of this.

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:12.050
Essentially, what they
find is that everybody

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.090
gets sort of slower towards
the end of the race.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.280
But if you're sort of
in reach of reaching

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.180
the goal by reaching
the time of 4 hours,

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.750
you're going to slow down less
or speed up a bit to just reach

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.620
that specific goal, OK?

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.120
Let me show you one more thing
of sports, which is golf.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.410
So how does golf work?

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:37.520
In case you don't know, you hit
a ball with a club from a tee

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.960
into a hole.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.610
The way this works is there's
usually 4 rounds of 18 holes.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:48.830
There is very convex incentives
in the golf tournament.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:50.600
So you get a bunch
of money if you win,

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.010
if you're sort of at the top.

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.165
For an average performance,
essentially you

01:03:54.165 --> 01:03:55.290
don't make that much money.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.430
I mean, you make good
money, but the prize money

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:02.010
is really in terms of
when you do really well.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.230
So now, what is par?

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:08.110
Par is how many strokes,
many shots, do you need to--

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.280
how many shots a very
good golfer should require

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.880
to complete a given hole.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.840
So par is usually
3, 4, or 5 shots.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.280
And then eagle is 2 below par.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.700
So if you have a par 4
hole, if you do 2 shots,

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.660
that's an eagle.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.120
If you do 3 shots in that
case, that would be a birdie.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.110
4 would be par.

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.030
Bogey would be 1 above par.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.900
And double bogey would
be 2 above par, OK?

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.380
So knowing all that, so
what matters for golf

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.600
at the end of a tournament
is how many shots do you

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.065
make in total.

01:04:40.065 --> 01:04:42.440
So how can we now look at
reference-dependent preferences

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.870
here in this setting?

01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:02.750
Yes.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.980
AUDIENCE: The reference
is the par [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.855
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

01:05:05.855 --> 01:05:06.980
The reference is the par.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:11.090
Now, suppose you are
putting, which is at the end,

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:12.398
you know, on the green.

01:05:12.398 --> 01:05:13.440
What are you going to do?

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.005
What kinds of
behaviors do we expect?

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.765
Yes.

01:05:18.765 --> 01:05:19.890
AUDIENCE: Well, it depends.

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:22.870
So if you're under
par, then you might

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.530
try-- like, you're
shooting for birdie,

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.530
or you're shooting for
par and it's a long putt,

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.290
you might try to make sure
that you get it to the hole.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:32.740
Whereas, if you are already
over par or double over par,

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.650
you might try to
play a little safer,

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:35.992
make sure you're not way over.

01:05:35.992 --> 01:05:36.950
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.490
So some of this is
about risk preferences,

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.673
how risky your shots are.

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.090
Another way to
think about this is

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:45.130
kind of how much effort
do you put in your shot.

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:49.750
In some sense, to the extent
that you can sort of allocate

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.210
attention or really
focus an effort,

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.580
maybe that's sort of limited
over the course of 18 holes

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:59.830
and 4 rounds of each of those.

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:03.250
You might sort of try
particularly hard to do well

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.190
on shots that make
you reach par compared

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:10.100
to shots that might get you
a birdie or even better.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.610
And so this is
exactly as you say.

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:15.130
The fairly obvious reference
point for each hole in golf

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.570
is reach par.

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.510
Importantly, it doesn't
matter whether you

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:23.020
have birdie, par, and
bogie, versus par, par, par.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.050
Essentially, that gives
you exactly the same amount

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:27.400
of shots overall.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.110
But now what Pope and
Schweitzer ask is the question,

01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:35.757
are putters more likely
to make their par

01:06:35.757 --> 01:06:37.090
than their birdie points, right?

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:42.340
So essentially, depending on
are you at possibility of losing

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.130
or at gaining,
essentially if you're

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:48.730
worried about losing par, are
you going to behave differently

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:51.520
compared to when you can make
a birdie, which is in the gain

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.780
domain potentially?

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.240
The same you could say about
bogies, where you're already

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.615
in the loss domain because
you're already doing terribly.

01:06:57.615 --> 01:07:00.310
And you're trying to
avoid a double bogey.

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:01.810
So now, what they
find, essentially,

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.830
is the par putts are much
more likely to be made.

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:06.910
There's 2 or 3 percentage
points more likely

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.040
to be made compared to
equivalent birdie putts.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.380
The authors rule out a bunch
of different explanation.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.780
It doesn't have to do with
the heterogeneity of player

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:14.680
ability.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.737
They even have sort of
like GPS information

01:07:16.737 --> 01:07:18.820
of exactly where the ball
is compared to the hole.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.278
And they do all
sorts of comparison

01:07:20.278 --> 01:07:21.348
of how hard the shot is.

01:07:21.348 --> 01:07:23.140
They don't think it
has to do with learning

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.112
from earlier putts.

01:07:24.112 --> 01:07:25.570
And it seems to
also not have to do

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:26.910
with hole specific preferences.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.660
Some holes are really
hard, and some holes

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.520
are really simple
and easy and so on.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.790
So it doesn't seem to
do with any of that.

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.690
So again, that's sort of another
instance of reference-dependent

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:40.850
that seems to be in
quite a few settings.

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:43.450
Let me sort of skip the Deal
or No Deal TV show, which

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.720
we can do briefly in recitation,
and talk a little bit

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.890
about prices and firms.

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:54.160
So one fact that
we see in the world

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.770
is that demand often
responds more strongly

01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:00.100
to price increases than to
price decreases of frequently

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.000
purchased items.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.920
And we already discussed
this last time.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.730
That's to say, so usually
people have a reference point

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:08.530
in terms of either
the price they pay

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:11.000
or the expenditures
on certain items.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.850
So now, as something
becomes more expensive,

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:14.308
what they tend to
do is essentially

01:08:14.308 --> 01:08:16.720
reduce how much the, for
example, gasoline or the like.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.229
They tend to then sort of
just reduce their expenditures

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:24.040
because they have a budget for,
say, gasoline or certain items.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.600
And so what they
tend to do is then

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.580
the reference point is
either the past price

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.229
or the past expenditures.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.050
And people tend to
sort of be loss averse

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:39.970
then over their expenditures
over the specific domain.

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.080
Now, that then leads to--

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.229
so if a firm knows this,
so essentially if you

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:49.569
know that essentially people
react a lot to price increases

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:54.050
compared to price decreases,
that leads to sticky prices,

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.550
essentially.

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:56.890
So raising your price
above a past price

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:59.470
is very costly because you
lose a lot of customers

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:00.680
from doing that.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.760
So now, lowering your
price below the past price

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.020
won't actually do very much.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.728
Essentially, you're
not going to generate

01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:07.990
a lot more extra demand.

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:10.060
Plus, raising the price
in the future is costly.

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.590
You know, essentially,
once you lower the price,

01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:12.840
it's hard to get up any more.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.060
So for these frequently
purchased items,

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.890
you see a lot of price
stickiness and price

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:24.460
equalization across markets,
across time and products.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.729
Now, that's sort of one thing
about prices in the world

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:29.352
that you would see.

01:09:29.352 --> 01:09:31.060
But more generally,
I want to sort of ask

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.859
the question in the
last few minutes

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:35.830
about, if you were
a company, suppose

01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:39.130
you did an internship
somewhere in the summer.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.895
You took behavioral economics.

01:09:41.895 --> 01:09:43.270
Hopefully, you
learned something.

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:49.383
But what can we learn about
the firm policies and so on now

01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:50.800
that you know about
loss aversion?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.467
What would you tell
them they should do?

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:11.730
Yes.

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:14.310
AUDIENCE: You could start with
having a really high price

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.430
and then lowering them.

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:18.270
Because people will
feel like, oh, I'm

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.542
getting [INAUDIBLE] deal.

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:20.500
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.010
So that was what previously
was mentioned is I say,

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:26.640
you could sort of, in particular
when you introduce a price,

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.278
new product and so on, you might
want to start at a high price

01:10:29.278 --> 01:10:30.570
and then sort of lowering them.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.190
And people really
like having deals,

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.940
and they feel good about it.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.990
Notice that that doesn't work
so well for products that you

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:38.160
already have and so on.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.350
Because then essentially, once
you start with a high price,

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:41.350
people get really upset.

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:43.180
And you will lose the customers.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.110
But once you introduce a new
product, be it like an iPhone

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:49.333
or be it like some whatever,
new computer or whatever,

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.750
it makes a lot of sense to
start with a really high price.

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.333
That sort of sets
the reference point.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.110
And then people sort
of feel like they

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:57.092
get good deals overall.

01:10:57.092 --> 01:10:58.050
What else could you do?

01:10:58.050 --> 01:10:58.550
Yes.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.308
AUDIENCE: You could
offer [INAUDIBLE] price.

01:11:01.308 --> 01:11:02.850
You could offer a
temporary discount.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.770
That was you keep
your reference point.

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:06.900
[INAUDIBLE] offer
discounts when you

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.328
want to lower the price
temporarily [INAUDIBLE]..

01:11:09.328 --> 01:11:10.370
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:12.120
That's what a lot of
companies tend to do.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.670
They tend to do, essentially,
these special occasions

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.502
with Black Friday and the like.

01:11:17.502 --> 01:11:18.960
Exactly as you say,
it's temporary.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.520
It's not a thing that prices
are permanently lower.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.040
It's just, right now,
you get this great deal.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.990
And then things
go back to normal.

01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:29.240
And somehow you have to hope
that people don't sort of

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.850
adjust their reference point
towards the temporarily

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:34.910
lowered price.

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:35.450
What else?

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:36.110
Yeah.

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:38.490
AUDIENCE: Kind of down that
line, you have free trials.

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.860
So companies sends you--

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.735
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

01:11:40.735 --> 01:11:43.040
AUDIENCE: --for [INAUDIBLE]
and then take it away,

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.900
people will feel more
compelled to get it back

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.440
because it's loss aversion.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.610
And that's what [? creates ?]
[INAUDIBLE] people value it

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.535
at higher price than otherwise.

01:11:53.535 --> 01:11:54.410
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.250
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.800
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.758
So if you shop online,
you might have wondered.

01:11:57.758 --> 01:11:59.508
Lots of companies have
this thing on like,

01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:01.038
oh, you can order
whatever you want.

01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:02.330
Essentially, it's free returns.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.638
And you kind of wonder,
that seems like a bad deal

01:12:04.638 --> 01:12:05.930
from the company's perspective.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.300
Because people buy a lot
of stuff and send it back.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.685
The hope is exactly as you say.

01:12:09.685 --> 01:12:11.810
It might be just in part
people like to experiment.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.160
And they like some
stuff and not others.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.385
And that's worth doing it.

01:12:14.385 --> 01:12:16.260
But the hope, in
particular, is to say, well,

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.802
I want you to try
it out for a while.

01:12:17.802 --> 01:12:19.460
You get used to it.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.930
Then the endowment
effect kicks in.

01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:22.040
You value it more.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.660
It essentially becomes yours.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:28.700
And then essentially you become
loss averse towards that.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.180
By the way, I should
have mentioned

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.335
this is really a fascinating
book by Cialdini who

01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:37.760
was talking about the
psychology of persuasion.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.310
He spend a lot of
time with salespeople,

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:42.410
in particular sort of car
salespeople and so on,

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.350
trying to learn what are they
actually doing in markets.

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:48.380
And he has these amazing
stories of salespeople, what's

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.300
all sorts of tricks they use.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.177
It's psychologically extremely
rich and interesting in terms

01:12:53.177 --> 01:12:55.010
of just trying to
understand what people do.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:59.390
And that ranges from things,
once you purchase a car,

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.190
they let you test
drive in the car.

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:02.030
And you sit in it.

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:03.620
And it feels like yours.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.387
Or when you try to
buy a house, then

01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:07.970
people would say, oh, you know,
this will be your living room.

01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:09.887
And this is where your
baby is going to sleep.

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:12.590
And there's lots of sort
of ways in which people

01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:14.870
make sort of something
feel yours and really try

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.940
to sort of get the
endowment effect to kick in.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.800
If you were to work
in an insurance firm,

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.560
what would you do, somebody
who offers insurance

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.070
in one way or the
other or products

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.720
that offer insurance
in some ways?

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:35.193
Yes.

01:13:35.193 --> 01:13:37.860
AUDIENCE: We talked about this a
little bit in a previous class.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.930
But this is why,
I think, companies

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:43.080
will sell things like Apple
Care or operative warranties.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.360
Because they know they'll
make money off of it

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.868
because people tend
to over-insure.

01:13:46.868 --> 01:13:47.910
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.460
There's lots of
different products

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.470
where there's extended
warranties and all sorts

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.740
of things, like Apple care,
et cetera, where people

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.880
are very risk averse, what it
looks like, presumably loss

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.760
averse where, in fact,
actually the claim

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.230
rate tends to be very low.

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.720
So you can make a lot of money
with this by saying, yes,

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.520
I'm going to exchange
it and this and that.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.530
Because, essentially,
it doesn't happen that

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.477
often at the end of
the day even if there's

01:14:13.477 --> 01:14:15.060
moral hazard or other
issues of people

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.600
not treating their stuff that
well once they have insurance.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:26.070
What about wage
setting, like when

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.750
you set your employees' wages?

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:31.210
Yeah.

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:34.440
AUDIENCE: Could that be
linked to mass unemployment

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.720
in recessions because you know
that, if you lower the wage,

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.590
then morale will go down a lot?

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:43.472
And you can actually decide
just to kick them out?

01:14:43.472 --> 01:14:44.430
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.930
Exactly.

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:53.040
So there is a large
literature on wage stickiness,

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.990
essentially exactly as you
say, where people are extremely

01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:59.910
reluctant to lower wages.

01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:02.250
Companies are very
reluctant to lower wages.

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.310
Because, essentially,
workers are really unhappy.

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:08.192
And these are often nominal
wages or real wages.

01:15:08.192 --> 01:15:09.650
It doesn't really
matter that much,

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:11.130
but usually it's nominal wages.

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:16.080
People really, really dislike
nominal wage reductions.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.270
And so, now, in some times
when companies would actually

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:24.840
need to lower wages and sort
of to be able to keep workers

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.990
not to make losses, companies
might rather sort of fire

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:31.830
some workers rather
than sort of lowering

01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:33.090
the wages for everybody.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.492
Because, essentially,
the remaining workers,

01:15:36.492 --> 01:15:37.950
once you lower
wages for everybody,

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.090
everybody would be unhappy.

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.760
If you just fire one
worker, everybody else

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.960
will be less unhappy than
about their wage reductions.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.750
Similarly, firms are sort
of reluctant to hire people

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.510
at lower wages, if there's other
people who make higher wages,

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.155
because people really
dislike weight dispersion.

01:15:54.155 --> 01:15:55.530
So essentially,
overall, you want

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.280
to avoid wage cuts
as much as possible.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.190
And that leads to
essentially then sort

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.247
of macroeconomic inefficiencies.

01:16:03.247 --> 01:16:04.830
And people have
argued, in particular,

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:10.410
it leads to unemployment
because, essentially, wages

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:13.410
are not going down as much
as they should in recessions.

01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:14.460
And that's bad for firms.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.200
And, therefore, they
hire fewer workers

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.983
or retain fewer workers overall.

01:16:18.983 --> 01:16:20.400
I think I mentioned,
we mentioned,

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.110
all of those kinds of things.

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:26.833
So now, that's sort of
what firms are doing.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.500
Now, another thing
you might think about

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.472
is what are you going to
actually do in your real lives.

01:16:31.472 --> 01:16:33.930
I think there's many different
things that you can actually

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:37.093
think about is the framing of
situations, for example, can

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.010
make a big difference.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.720
If you present something
to your friends,

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.500
different options, whether you
present that as gains or losses

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.930
makes a big difference
potentially.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:48.540
Managing people's expectations
is really important.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.610
If there's some big goal
that they could reach

01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:52.380
or some lower goal
they could reach,

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.030
if you sort of oversell
the high chance

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:56.048
of reaching some
big goal, they might

01:16:56.048 --> 01:16:58.090
reach the other goal that's
actually pretty good,

01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:01.020
might feel really
disappointed about that,

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.310
be it in job search or the like.

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.810
So managing people's
expectations,

01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:07.810
including your own expectations,
seems really important.

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:10.080
There's something about
aggregating losses and gains,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.960
which essentially is to
say, since people seem

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.810
to be risk averse over gains--

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.170
so since value function is
concave over gains and convex

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.020
over losses, what
you should do is

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.790
potentially be really careful
about when you give people

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:34.320
a positive or negative
feedback or bonuses and so on.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.950
You might want to sort
of be careful whether you

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:39.600
aggregate the losses or--

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.050
so aggregating losses makes
sense because essentially it's

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.480
convex in the loss
domain, as opposed to you

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.013
want to give small
increments of gains overall.

01:17:48.013 --> 01:17:49.680
Now, one thing that
I do want to mention

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.480
is you want to be
kind of very careful

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.100
with loss-framed incentives.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:57.240
There's a company who
was trying to do this.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.010
These are car
manufacturers who were

01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:02.910
trying to give essentially
their car dealers incentives,

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:09.802
sort of targets for their
sales of their cars.

01:18:09.802 --> 01:18:11.760
What essentially happened
in the end of the day

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.540
is there was a bunch
of multitasking.

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.280
The company or the
car salespeople

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.400
were essentially selling certain
cars, but then not others

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.900
and were essentially
multitasking

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.970
and then sort of reverting,
sort of reallocating efforts

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:27.570
to one thing versus
the other, which then

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:28.950
seemed like a really good idea.

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:31.858
There was recently a valuation
that sort of showed that that

01:18:31.858 --> 01:18:33.150
was actually a pretty bad idea.

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:35.067
And the company would
have lost a lot of money

01:18:35.067 --> 01:18:37.545
overall if this had been scaled.

01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:39.420
We're going to have
this, the Deal or No Deal

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.980
and this specific
paper in recitation

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.540
to tell you in more
detail because I

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:46.620
want to move towards social
preferences next time.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.010
So as I said, next time we
talk about social preferences.

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:50.790
Bring your laptop.

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:52.415
And I'll send you
further instructions.

01:18:52.415 --> 01:18:54.020
Thank you.

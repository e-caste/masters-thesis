00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.906
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:25.406
Yes.

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:29.466
Let's have an on time departure.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.748
The topic of last class
was the ac Stark effect.

00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:35.616
And I said what I've
been saying to you,

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:40.874
was additional [INAUDIBLE]
of the ac Stark difference

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.800
from perturbation theory.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.650
But then I have three
points for discussion.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.276
The first one was [INAUDIBLE]
for the [INAUDIBLE] problem,

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:50.240
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.450
The second one was the
oscillator strength,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.550
which we almost finished.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.760
And today, I want to say a
few words about [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
And eventually how
the ac Stark effect

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.815
leads to the absorption
coefficient, which many of you

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:10.174
use [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.710
So I mentioned that the
oscillator strength is actually

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.959
one way to parametrize
the matrix element.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.344
We'll actually talk
most of the lecture

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:31.729
today about matrix
element, but I

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.340
come to that in a few minutes.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.700
From here, the matrix
element is nothing,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.880
but you get on with [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.222
Sure, it's a dimension
of the Bohr radius

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:44.610
but we don't really think
in terms of lengths.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.680
There are two ways how you
want to use a matrix element.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.526
One is the matrix
elements squared,

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.234
having some other
effect with which

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:54.520
to [INAUDIBLE] this
likeness, an actual likeness

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.220
against a number you should
know how to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.606
Or another way to
parametrize matrix elements

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:04.480
is by this [INAUDIBLE]
number, which

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.354
is what we will
see in this class.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.169
And that's, of
course, also related

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.180
to semi-classical physics.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.130
And I mentioned that
in the last class,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.102
that the oscillator
strength allows

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:19.350
us to connect the quantum
mechanical treatment of an atom

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.330
to the response of a
classical harmonic oscillator

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.755
through the charge of
an external [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.640
So I used this expression,
it was the end of class last.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.112
I used this expression
for the matrix element

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:48.090
in terms of the
oscillator strengths

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.777
to give you a nice relationship
for strong transition

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:58.530
as in the alkaline E lines,
where the oscillator strength

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.010
is close to 1.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.240
You see that the
matrix element is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.390
1 over square of 2
times the geometric mean

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.840
of the complete wave
lengths of the electron,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.626
and the wave lengths
of the transition.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:16.500
So that's actually important
for the dipole approximation,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.580
because the concurrent wave
lengths of the electron

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.730
is very, very small.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.850
So therefore if
the matrix element

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.650
is the geometric
mean of the two,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.990
that means that
the matrix element

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.460
is smaller than the
optical wave lengths.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.920
And therefore,
the matrix element

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.356
is the length scale,
the relevant length

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:39.730
scale of the atom
for transition.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.570
It is smaller than the
optical wave lengths.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.640
And that means-- and we'll
talk about it today--

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.488
that in the expression E to
the IKR, KR is really small.

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:54.364
So we can do the
dipole approximation.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.340
Now I have a question for you.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.510
I did it, frankly,
because we don't

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.160
have many questions
to discuss with.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.405
But I mentioned that there is
a sum rule for the oscillator

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:11.300
strengths.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.030
And the sum rule limits it to 1.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.450
And if there's a really
strong transition,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.410
it kind of exhausts
the sum rule,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.769
and this is what I
was talking about.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.400
But because the thought crossed
my mind after last lecture,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.360
if I don't add
something to it, you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.950
may actually use it as a
proof, which would be wrong.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.430
That the matrix element cannot
be larger than what you see

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.430
on the right hand side.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.612
On the other hand, we discussed
in the context of Rydberg atoms

00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:53.554
that Rydberg atoms can
have huge matrix elements.

00:04:53.554 --> 00:05:04.735
Matrix elements
which [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:07.650
but they can really become huge.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.676
So how do you reconcile
the fact that Rydberg atoms

00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:16.003
in large instates, in
states with large strengths

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:20.670
of [INAUDIBLE] numbers can
have huge matrix elements.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.960
How do you reconcile
it with our discussion

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.385
of oscillator strengths
and sum rules?

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.659
The answer is simple but subtle.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.980
So is it a proof that the
matrix elements are impossible?

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.420
Or if big matrix elements,
huge matrix elements,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:06:01.020
are possible, what property
of the oscillator strengths

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.012
did I not emphasize?

00:06:25.422 --> 00:06:27.470
I mean, keep watching.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.120
So first, are there atoms which
have huge matrix elements?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.850
Yes.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.726
Rydberg atoms.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.510
So the left hand side
can be really huge.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.750
On the right hand side,
we have the wave lengths

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.100
of the transition
which can get large.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.730
You have to count
the wave lengths.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.650
But then you have the
oscillator strengths.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.540
And the oscillator
strengths, the sum

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.440
of all oscillator
strengths is 1.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.810
But you have to be careful
that not all oscillator

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.210
strengths have to be possible.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.660
The definition of the
oscillator strengths

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.320
involves frequency from
one state to the next.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.220
And depending whether
you go up or down,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.390
the frequency has
positive or negative side.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.520
So therefore we have a sum rule.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.490
For the ground state,
all frequencies

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.940
are positive because
you can only go up.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.145
So therefore the
sum rule is only

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:44.980
very useful for
the ground state,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.550
because all oscillator
strengths are positive.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.635
And if one oscillator
strength is 1,

00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:55.080
you know no other transition
has any strength at all.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.020
However when you
have an excited state

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.900
and you find an oscillator
strength which is 1,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.683
you could still have a lot
of other strong transitions,

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:05.016
but their oscillator strengths
are positive and negative

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:09.580
and they compensate for
each other in the sum rule.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.600
So just be careful about that.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.575
For the ground state-- and
this is what I've proven to you

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:16.820
here, I think
fairly rigorously--

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.260
if you are in the ground state,
the transition matrix element

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.560
cannot be larger than
the geometric mean

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.642
of the [INAUDIBLE] wave lengths
and the [INAUDIBLE] wave

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:29.160
lengths.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.190
But for excited states,
you have to be careful,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.389
because the oscillator
strengths can have cosines.

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:36.784
OK.

00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:41.809
Any questions about that?

00:08:45.690 --> 00:09:11.010
Then let's talk quickly
about the third point

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.910
I wanted to discuss.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.895
And this is the relationship
to the index of refraction.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.712
The polarizability here is
responsible for the index

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:28.656
of refraction.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.260
Well, the polarizability
determines [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.830
evaluate the constant and use
whatever relation you want,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.990
but for a common
physics purpose,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.880
this is sort of the
useful relation.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.950
This is the index of refraction.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.980
It's related to
the polarizability.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.014
And assuming that the
polarizability is small,

00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:53.300
you get this, the
parallel extension.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.430
So roughly saying n minus 1.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.290
The difference of the index
of refraction from the vacuum

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.400
is proportionate to
the atomic density

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.570
times the polarizability.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.100
OK.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.815
And we know this is what we
derive from the perturbation

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.440
theory, that the
polarizability depends

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.640
on a matrix element squared
and 1 over the cube.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.643
Now I want to sort of show you
that by just using that concept

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:22.250
and putting in
phenomenologically dissipation,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.040
we can get a full expression
what happens to a laser

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.400
beam crossing an atomic medium,
like a [INAUDIBLE] condensate.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.180
How much of the laser
beam is absorbed?

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.326
And what is the feature
of the laser beam.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:46.975
In order to get interesting
or simple formula,

00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:50.430
I want to now parametrize
the matrix element

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.220
by this correlated gamma.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.870
This will turn out with
an actual [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.995
but right now, since
we haven't talked

00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:59.140
about spontaneous
emission, just say

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.590
I replace the matrix
element by gamma.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.805
And then I can write
the index of refraction

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:05.680
in the following way.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.210
But the matrix element squared
is now parametrized by gamma.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.130
I have also introduced
the coordinate sigma

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.790
0, which will later be
the lesson in absorption

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.920
for section for atoms.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.160
But again here, just use
it as a parametrization.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.035
I mean, I've not introduced
any new concepts.

00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:29.260
I've just rewritten this
expression in this way,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:35.340
involved sigma 0, which is a
cross-section, and gamma, which

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.814
is an actual light.

00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:40.020
OK.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.970
The polarizability depended--
that was perturbation

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.615
theory-- 1 over the
energy denominator,

00:12:03.615 --> 00:12:07.340
or 1 over the [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:13.390
Now we have used, with
the oscillator strengths,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.664
the analogy to a classical
harmonic oscillator.

00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:21.060
And at some level, you know
that every harmonic oscillator

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.880
must have little bit of damping.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.210
And so the same applies
to atomic oscillators.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.620
And if you can account
for the damping

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.140
by putting into the frequency
denominator of the [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.550
1 over delta.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.626
Give it an imaginary part.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:42.440
So I'm just telling
you here, yes.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.080
Every oscillator
has some damping,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.420
and I can phenomenologically
accounting for the damping

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.970
by making the resonant
frequency, or the tuning,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.020
slightly complex by
adding imaginary part.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.370
Later on I want to express
all the tunings normalized

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.730
to this line which is parallel
to a normalized [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.550
imaginary part.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.050
OK.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.050
So we have the situation
that this expression, gamma

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.540
over delta-- this
was the expression

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.650
for the polarizability--
now acquires

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:37.310
a small imaginary part, and that
means it's a complex number.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.730
And I can now take this
expression separate it

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:46.190
into an imaginary
part and a real part.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.960
So why do I do that?

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.355
Well, the index of
refraction appears

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:53.650
in the propagation
of the plane wave.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.480
If you're a plane
wave, the key vector

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.690
is no longer the key
vector in vacuum.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.700
It's multiplied with
the index of refraction,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.850
and that's what I do here.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.930
And now you see
that immediately,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.640
an imaginary part of
the index of refraction

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.830
leads to absorption.

00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:19.185
And the real part
leads to [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.450
OK.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.790
So what we have now is we have
this expression for the plane

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.550
wave after it is propagated
through the medium.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.810
And we see there is
exponential absorption.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.410
Exponential absorption.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.840
On resonance, we have
an optimal density

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.520
which is given by
this expression.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.710
And the second term here
give us a phase shift.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.210
And it's clear since we
have one medium which

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:54.485
has a certain thickness that the
optical density and the phase

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:57.630
shift are related.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.270
Yes.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.040
If you're on resonance, you
have the maximum optical density

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.250
and the maximum absorption.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.030
And the optical
density, of course,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.450
is 1 over the
[INAUDIBLE] squared.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.950
Whereas for large detuning,
the phase shift goes as 1

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.850
over delta.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.710
It's the dispersive
scaling with the tuning,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.580
and this is also what we
had when we started out.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.150
When we would have started out
with the polarizability and not

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.336
a decaying dissipation, because
far away from resonance,

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:32.646
you simply have a regional
of dispersive effect,

00:15:32.646 --> 00:15:36.510
and dissipation doesn't occur.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:43.560
So anyway, I
thought I would just

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.110
show that to you because this
is a full understanding of what

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.141
happens to optical views
when they pass the atomic

00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:50.640
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.280
It's nothing else than
the polarizability

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.200
or the harmonic
oscillator response

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.480
of an atom to
electromagnetic radiation.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.000
The only thing which is
non-derivative here is--

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.750
and that's what we will
discuss later in this course--

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.990
is in order to get the
final result, which

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.290
you may want to use in
analyzing your data,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.680
you have to set the
dissipative, the damping

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.410
of the harmonic oscillator,
equal with this gamma

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.910
parameter.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.600
And that's something I cannot
tell you without talking about

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.530
spontaneous emission.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.575
So just to remind you, I
introduce big gamma just

00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:33.710
as a parametrization
of the matrix element.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.890
Then I introduce
phenomenologically little gamma

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.330
as just the damping of
the harmonic oscillator

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.030
of those two quantities
for two levels [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.016
are identical.

00:16:43.016 --> 00:16:45.650
And that's something I
cannot show you here,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.876
because this requires discussion
of spontaneous emission

00:16:48.876 --> 00:16:51.330
and the other modes of
the electromagnetic field.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.047
This is not covered by
a discussion of the ac

00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:54.672
polarizability.

00:16:59.112 --> 00:16:59.612
OK.

00:16:59.612 --> 00:17:03.070
Any questions?

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.609
But still-- I know
I'm repeating myself--

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.970
I always find it interesting
that the whole physics

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.134
of absorption, the
beams are absorbed,

00:17:11.134 --> 00:17:13.212
you can pretty much pull
it out of the response

00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:14.859
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.450
It's only the damping rate
of the harmonic oscillator

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.760
that this is simply
spontaneous emission.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.299
That's the only
point where you have

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:27.349
to go beyond the ac Stark shift
and bring in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.860
nature of the
electromagnetic field

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.840
and all the empty
modes of the vacuum.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:42.050
Any questions about waves,
or in general interactions

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.515
of atoms with electric
and magnetic fields?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.756
Well, then let's move on.

00:17:56.756 --> 00:18:01.295
We have talked about
electric and magnetic fields

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.640
intimately for
very good reasons,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.568
because low frequency fields
are either electric or magnetic

00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:08.560
in nature.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.470
But ultimately, we
want to understand

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.660
what happens when atoms
interact with light.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.650
And this is our
discussion for today.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:34.070
The outline of this
chapter is as follows.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:45.201
Today, all I want to discuss is
the coupling matrix in an atom.

00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:49.750
In other words, when we have
a Hamiltonian between state A

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:55.310
and B, we have an
off-diagonal matrix element.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.700
And this off-diagonal matrix
element causes transitions.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.030
Or when we calculate it, the
effect of electric field--

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.370
the ec Stark effect or
the ac Stark effect,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.030
we assume there was a
quantity, state 1, state 2,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.560
and we put some
operator in between.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.940
So this was a matrix element
which connects the two states.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.040
And so far, we
have always assumed

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.740
using the classical
multiple expansion

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.990
of electromagnetic field energy
that this matrix element has

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.820
the form electric field
times dipole matrix element.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.830
And therefore, the
relevant matrix element

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.814
was the position operator of
the electron connecting the two

00:19:43.814 --> 00:19:45.170
states.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.310
So in a way, we have
used it all the time.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.336
But in any more advanced
discussion of atomic physics,

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:55.320
you have two states.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.630
And as long as they
are coupled, you

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.740
have something
which you call H1 2

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.300
or you call it
matrix element N1 2,

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.630
and you're not even asking
where it comes from.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.880
When two levels are coupled,
they undergo Rabi oscillations.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.879
You have transitions.

00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:12.420
If you're in the excited state
and you have a matrix element,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.940
you get spontaneous emission.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.880
So a lot of the things
we want to discuss

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.260
about atomic physics,
all they require

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.125
a number which is a matrix
element between state

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:22.840
1 and state 2.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:29.690
And today, I want to talk to
you about different mechanisms

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.210
which can lead to
matrix element.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.990
We talked about the
dipole operator,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.230
but you also talk about
higher order possibilities,

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.840
magnetic dipole coupling, or
electric [INAUDIBLE] coupling.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.900
And a little bit later--
this is an outlook--

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.240
we will talk about
twofold uncoupling.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.550
But in the end, even if
it's a twofold uncoupling,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.950
for a lot or phenomena,
all you need is a coupling.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.445
A coupling means
a Rabi frequency.

00:20:54.445 --> 00:20:58.410
A Rabi frequency means Rabi
oscillation, and so on.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.310
So today the focus is,
what is the structure, what

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.190
are the principles
behind this number, which

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.060
is a relevant matrix element.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.560
OK.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.290
So that's today.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.510
Next week is spring
break, but when we resume,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.860
we then want to talk about what
is the matrix element doing?

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:25.710
And there are two cases
which we have to consider.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:32.620
One is we can see it's
narrow band and broad band.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.670
This matrix element
can couple just

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.480
to one move of the
electromagnetic field.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.430
Everything is coherent.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.520
We have coherent
Rabi oscillation.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.330
Or you can couple to
many modes, and then you

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.580
have a broad band situation,
which may be described

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.890
[INAUDIBLE] and this
[INAUDIBLE] unit.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.050
Very, very different behavior.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.220
So that's what we
then want to discuss.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.220
When atoms interact
with light, we

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.680
have two very different
limiting cases, narrow band

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.402
and broad band.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:08.480
And eventually, we want to
go beyond the semi-classical

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.731
formulation of the
electromagnetic field

00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:14.370
and we'll talk about the
quantized electromagnetic

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.870
field.

00:22:22.371 --> 00:22:22.870
OK.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:28.730
So let's talk about the
coupling between atoms

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.590
and electromagnetic fields.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.680
I want to give you
very brief derivation

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:48.920
of the canonical coupling
between electromagnetic fields

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.640
and atoms.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.710
I know this is covered
in many textbooks,

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.590
and we have a very
deep discussion

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:58.740
about it using the full
QED formulas in A422,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.860
but I feel this
course A421 would not

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.070
be complete without a
discussion like that.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.040
And secondly-- this
is so important

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.830
if you hear it twice from
two different angles, that's

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.550
probably useful-- I
just want to remind you

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:24.090
that if you use classical
electromagnetism

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:33.550
and the Lagrangian
formalism, you find the very

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:39.200
elegant result that the coupling
to the electromagnetic field

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:47.770
can be introduced by
modifying the momentum.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.860
That the canonical momentum
which appears in the Lagrangian

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.950
equation is no longer
the mechanical momentum

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.240
which gives rise to
kinetic energy, But?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.470
It is modified by
the vector potential.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:14.449
So therefore the
Hamiltonian-- at this point

00:24:14.449 --> 00:24:16.240
it's the classical
Hamiltonian, but then we

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.320
use the same expression
in quantum mechanics.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:28.300
The Hamiltonian has kinetic
energy and potential energy.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:35.400
But the kinetic energy
is no longer p square.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.140
Because by p, I mean now
the canonical momentum.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.410
We have to correct for
the vector potential

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.170
to go from the
canonical momentum

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.920
to the mechanical momentum.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.600
And if we squared it, this
gives the kinetic energy.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.980
If you worry about
this sign here,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.640
I will assume now that
the electron has a charge.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.510
The charge q f the
electron was minus e,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.590
so that's why we have a plus
sign here and not a minus sign.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.900
OK.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:25.880
So we will use this fact that we
have to substitute the momentum

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.240
operator by the
canonical momentum, which

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.415
is no longer the
mechanical momentum.

00:25:30.415 --> 00:25:33.370
We used it also in our
quantum mechanical Hamiltonian

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.430
in the Schrodinger equation.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.010
If you ask me, can you prove it?

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.560
No.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.870
Nobody can prove it.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.250
We can never prove what a
quantum mechanical equation is.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.180
We can just use
physical understanding,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.630
physical analogies.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.540
And that's how quantum mechanics
was developed in [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.950
Based on the classic quantum
mechanical correspondence,

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.890
this seems to be a very
reasonable assumption.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.200
And ultimately, this very
reasonable assumption

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.030
has now withstood the test of
time for many, many decades,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.790
over almost 100 years.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.530
So that's why we assume that
doing the same substitution

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.460
in the Schrodinger equation
for the momentum operator

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.400
gives the right result,
but there is no way

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.780
how you can rigorously
derive fundamental equations

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.470
in physics.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.020
You can observe
nature, postulate them,

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.350
and verify them.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.630
So therefore, this line, which
was the classical Hamiltonian,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.170
by interpreting
p as an operator,

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.570
is now our quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.000
And the one thing we
have to consider now

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.175
is that once we have
quantum mechanical operator,

00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:44.610
we have to be careful
about compute order.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.200
That certain quantities
have to be ordered.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.530
It matters which
one we put first.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.595
What is convenient now is
to use the Coulomb gauge.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:04.750
In the Coulomb gauge,
diversions of A is zero.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.120
But the del operator, the
deliberative operator,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.420
is the operator of the
canonical momentum.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.390
And therefore, if you
use the Coulomb gauge,

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:25.230
then we have commutativity
between the canonical momentum,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.228
p, and the vector potential.

00:27:28.228 --> 00:27:32.200
And that's sort of nice,
because if you take this square

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.170
and square it out, we
get p dot A plus A dot p,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.740
but they are the same
in the Coulomb gauge.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:47.805
So therefore our Hamiltonian
has now the following terms.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.760
We call it H naught.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.484
And we assume that the Coulomb
potential of the nucleus,

00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:05.400
which eventually gets
the electronic structure

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.880
of the atom, is included here.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.680
So this is the
Hamiltonian part which

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.300
describes the
structure of atoms.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.530
And then we have two
terms which couple

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.985
to the electromagnetic field.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.901
So this is p dot A or A dot p.

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.525
It doesn't matter in
the Coulomb gauge.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.440
We call this the
interaction Hamiltonian.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.750
And now we get a
second order term,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.130
which is the A square term.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.150
Well, since it's second
order, we designate it.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.722
We use the symbol H2.

00:28:52.722 --> 00:28:55.690
In the following, we neglect
the second order term.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.160
The argument is for weak fields.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.910
It doesn't matter.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.470
It's not so important
because it's higher order.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.620
However, in A422, we
look at it more carefully

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.930
and we can actually do a
canonical transformation which

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.920
eliminates the A square term.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.155
So to drop it is not necessary.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.920
You can actually show with
a canonical transformation

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.260
that I'm doing is actually
more exact than just

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.950
saying small and delineated.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:31.460
But anyway, I don't want to
spend too much time on it.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.900
All I wanted to remind you, what
are the steps to obtain-- just

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.600
give me one second-- to obtain
the interaction Hamiltonian,

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.000
and that's what I want
to use for the remainder

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.990
of this class.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.900
That we have the
coupling of momentum

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.440
to the vector potential.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.299
We assume that the vector
potential-- we are not

00:29:56.299 --> 00:29:57.840
quantizing the
electromagnetic field.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.970
It's a semi-classical field.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.080
It's therefore a
classical vector.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:13.390
And we will
investigate what is now

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.560
the coupling between an
atom for this Hamiltonian

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.710
to a plane wave of the
electromagnetic field.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.500
So therefore we are introducing
for the vector potential

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.400
the expression that the vector
potential has an Hamiltonian

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.220
naught.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:32.000
The polarization p hat, and
then the plane wave factor

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.234
e to the ikr minus i omega t.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.470
So this can be divided in
a much more rigorous way,

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.370
but this is now the starting
point of our discussion.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:46.330
OK.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.962
Any questions about that?

00:30:52.962 --> 00:30:53.826
Yes.

00:30:53.826 --> 00:30:55.122
Matt.

00:30:55.122 --> 00:30:57.464
AUDIENCE: Is it a
little bit weird

00:30:57.464 --> 00:31:01.360
that you're going to take the
divergence of its particular A

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.126
that's not 0?

00:31:03.126 --> 00:31:09.535
Since it's divergence of e to
the ik dot r, just k dot A?

00:31:28.762 --> 00:31:30.241
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:40.430
You said the divergence
of A-- so you're

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.710
asking what is the
divergence of A,

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.011
if A is a plane
wave e to the ikr?

00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:49.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
propagation of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:49.304 --> 00:31:49.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:56.550
What happens is,
the polarization is

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.150
A, and if you take the
divergence of the plane wave,

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.800
you get a K vector, so you get
this [INAUDIBLE] product of e

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.750
dot k.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.280
And electromagnetic
waves propagate.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.540
The polarizations
[INAUDIBLE] propagation.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:15.690
So ultimately what you
find is with Coulomb gauge

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.300
and the radiation
field is transverse.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.720
It is only polarization
[INAUDIBLE] propagation.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:26.330
OK.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:30.220
So we want to talk
about matrix element.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.000
So the matrix element
between two states.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.670
Du to the interaction
Hamiltonian for one plane wave

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:46.200
has the e to the minus i omega
t dependence, which is trivial.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.670
I mean, in terms
of we will assume

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.640
that there is a
monochromatic wave.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.670
And what you want
to discuss now is

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.887
this time independent
factor, H ba.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.575
Let me get the factors.

00:33:06.575 --> 00:33:10.300
Let me get the polarization.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:16.150
So your relevant operator which
connects the two states A and B

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.590
is the momentum operator.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:29.720
And now for the
plane wave, we want

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:41.900
to do an expansion
in orders of kr.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:50.200
And the leading term will
be the dipole approximation

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.340
and the next order
term will give rise

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.750
to magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole transitions.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.480
So first, the fact that
I can do this expansion

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.200
requires that k dot A
is much smaller than 1.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:22.150
So it's a long wave
length approximation,

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:26.406
which you can say is valid as
long as the atom is smaller

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:29.550
than the wave length
we are talking about.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.300
And I will show you later when
I discuss the next higher order

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.719
term that for atoms
in the ground state,

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.650
this is actually also
an expansion alpha.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.020
So again we retrieve the
fine-structure constant.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:51.520
So when we do this expansion
of this plane wave exponential,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.960
every term is smaller
than the previous term

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:09.240
by the fine-structure constant
alpha, which is 1 over 137.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:09.870
OK.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:21.870
So the leading term is
the 1, and this gives rise

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.347
to the dipole approximation.

00:35:24.347 --> 00:35:26.180
So what I want to show
you now in one or two

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.830
minutes is that this is indeed
the dipole approximation.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.500
It leads to a
matrix element which

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.720
is electric field times
r, the dipole moment.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.420
What we have right now is A
dot p, the vector potential,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.149
times the momentum.

00:35:43.149 --> 00:35:44.690
So in other words,
I want to show you

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:49.000
that the A dot p matrix element
is equivalent to an e dot r

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.800
matrix element.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.150
This can be done with a
canonical transformation, which

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.350
we'll do in A422, but here
let me sort of just show you

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.220
the elementary discussion.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.780
We want to replace
the vector potential

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.980
by the electric field.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.810
So therefore, we use the
fact that the electric field

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.650
is the derivative of
the vector potential.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.280
And the derivative of
the vector potential

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.920
means since we have an E the
minus i omega t dependence,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.210
that we simply multiply
with a factor of omega

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.130
of the frequency.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.180
And what we obtain here
is then the amplitude

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.710
of the electric field, E naught.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.260
So with that, we
have a matrix element

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.945
which now involves
the electric field.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.635
But still the matrix element
of the momentum operator.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.210
But we can easily go from
the momentum operator

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.080
to the position operator
by taking the fact

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.040
that the momentum
operator is nothing

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.110
else than the commutator of r
with the Hamiltonian H naught.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.370
The kinetic energy in
H naught is p square,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:26.500
and the commutator of r
with p square is simply p.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.475
So this is what I'm using here.

00:37:30.475 --> 00:37:34.858
And these are the p factors.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:48.140
So therefore if you take the
momentum operator between two

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:59.400
states, we have this relation
between the momentum operator

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.690
and the position operator.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:06.340
But we have not the
momentum operator.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.960
We have the commutator.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.910
And r H naught gives us r.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:17.090
But when H naught acts on the
a, it gives the energy in a.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.300
For the other part of
the commutator, which

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.230
is H naught r, we can have H
naught act on the left hand

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:28.644
side on b, and this
gives us the energy ab.

00:38:28.644 --> 00:38:32.460
For dividing by H
bar, what we get

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.330
is the energy
difference, eb minus ea.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.950
Or in frequency units, omega ba.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:43.435
So this is now how we have
implemented the commutator.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:59.220
So that by inserting
this into this equation,

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:04.890
we now finally obtain our
result for the matrix element

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.210
in the dipole approximation.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:15.210
We have e, the electric field
amplitude, the polarization,

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:22.890
the matrix element
b r a, omega ba,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:27.380
and here we have an 1 over
omega in the denominator, which

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.451
came from the derivative of
the vector potential da dt.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.915
This here is the matrix
element of the dipole operator.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:01.610
So in other words, I
have derived for you

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.862
that the interaction
matrix element

00:40:04.862 --> 00:40:15.420
in the dipole approximation
is the dipole operator

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.720
times the electric field as
long as I make the approximation

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.140
that this frequency factor's
on the order of [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:32.530
Now this is clearly the
case in your resonance,

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.240
so you should be safe.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.545
However, if you do the
more rigorous derivation

00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:48.770
of the dipole Hamiltonian
using canonical transformation,

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:52.960
this factor of omega ba
over omega does not appear.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.096
So again, the dipole
approximations

00:40:55.096 --> 00:40:57.460
is better than I
presented today.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:02.070
The two approximations
topping the A squared term

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:06.340
and approximating this
ratio of frequencies with 1

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.619
is not necessary if you
use the other methods using

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:11.660
canonical transformation.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.790
Any questions about that?

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.190
Let me make one comment.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.510
I've shown you in
this derivation

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:38.540
that the A dot p term,
the A dot p interaction

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.180
within the dipole approximation
is identical to the e dot r

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.770
interaction.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:49.190
So these are the same operators,
and if you would exactly

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.170
calculate them in atomic
structure calculation,

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.740
you would get the same coupling,
the same matrix element.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.330
However, in practice, there
are important differences.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:03.450
Because the E dot r
operator, the r operator,

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.550
has a lot of weight
where the electron is

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.100
far away from the nucleus
because it's multiplied with r.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.130
Whereas the p operator
emphasizes the derivative

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.580
of the wave function,
and this is usually

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.260
strong at close distances.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.840
So in the end, the results
have to be the same.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.670
But if you make an approximation
to your wave function,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.130
one formulation may be
numerically much more accurate

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.040
than the other one.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.430
But fundamentally, the
two terms are the same

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.988
and they are related the way
how I derived it for you.

00:42:39.988 --> 00:42:40.488
Yes?

00:42:40.488 --> 00:42:42.958
AUDIENCE: So when we say it's
the dipole approximation,

00:42:42.958 --> 00:42:46.190
does it mean that it's
a long wave length,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.310
or be the small field
or everything together.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.574
So what's the absolute
fundamental assumption of this?

00:42:53.574 --> 00:42:55.490
PROFESSOR: The absolute
fundamental assumption

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.410
of the dipole
approximation is that we

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.800
assume-- let me just scroll up.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.190
In the equation above,
we had an expression

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.240
for the vector potential.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:18.570
And the dipole
approximation means

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.270
that we can neglect the position
dependence of the vector

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:25.160
potential A of r,
so we approximate A

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:31.610
of r as being A evaluated
at the origin of the atom.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.540
And over the extent, over
the size of the atom,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.710
we do not have to consider
a spacial dependence

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.380
of the vector potential.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.490
So this is sufficient.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.740
The other things that
e square is small

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.760
and that we're
near resonance-- I

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.480
have to make those
assumptions if I

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.170
want to use this
elementary derivation.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.590
But with a canonical
transformation,

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.790
as is discussed in
atom-photon interactions,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.190
you do not need those
additional assumptions.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.870
The only assumption behind
the dipole approximation

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:10.750
is that one, and this means
that the extent of the atom

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.092
is much smaller than the
optical wave lengths.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.510
OK.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:33.140
But there are situations where
the leading approximation

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.050
vanishes.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.930
For instance, if two levels
have the same parity,

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:41.820
then the dipole operator
between the two of them is 0.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.966
And then if you want to
have a transition between,

00:44:44.966 --> 00:44:47.340
or if you want to consider a
transition between those two

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.410
levels, it will come
from next order terms.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:45:00.960
So let's now discuss higher
order radiation processes.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:15.190
So the motivation why I want to
discuss higher order radiation

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:19.420
processes is because
in some basic courses,

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.830
you only need the
dipole approximation.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.145
And you think the
dipole coupling

00:45:24.145 --> 00:45:26.630
is the only coupling
which exists in the world.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.447
And by going to
higher order, I want

00:45:28.447 --> 00:45:31.240
to show you that
this is not the case.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.050
Also I want to sort of
give you an idea what

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:38.860
it means if you
have leading order

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.310
transitions are forbidden.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.910
I want to sort of show
you how other terms come

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:46.150
in which can couple two levels.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:53.600
And also, actually, when
you drive transitions

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.950
within the hyper-fine structure
using radio frequency fields,

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.780
you are not driving them
with the electric dipole

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.546
approximation.

00:46:00.546 --> 00:46:03.110
You're driving them
with a magnetic dipole,

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:07.820
and this is actually
the next approximation.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.610
So there's a number
of reasons why

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:13.100
I want to show you what
the next order terms are,

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.050
and how they actually
lead to beautiful result,

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.222
magnetic dipole, and electric
quadrupole transitions.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:39.290
So our coupling term-- let
me just rewrite the equation.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.060
Let me now simplify the
notation by assuming

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.075
that the polarization
is in the z direction

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:54.135
and the propagation
is in the x direction.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:03.880
So then the coupling
had the dipole term.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.170
And the next order
term is ikx, and this

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.150
is what we want to
investigate now.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:26.450
So the term kx or kr is smaller.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.626
And now I want to
show you explicitly

00:47:28.626 --> 00:47:31.380
that it's smaller by alpha.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:37.140
The k vector of the photon is
related to the frequency H bar

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.650
omega divided by H bar z.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.126
If I approximate for
r, the relevant r

00:47:44.126 --> 00:47:46.910
when we indicate over
the wave function

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.412
will be the Bohr radius.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:07.040
The relevant frequency, H bar
omega, well, it's a Rydberg.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:13.100
And the Rydberg is e square
over the Bohr radius.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:20.700
So now if I insert it, the
Bohr radius cancels out.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.770
And what we find is,
well, kr is dimensionless.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.130
We have to find something
which is dimensionless,

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.620
but expressed by the fundamental
constants of atomic physics.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.287
And the only quantity which is
available for that-- it's not

00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:35.430
a surprise-- is alpha.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.960
The fine-structure constant.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.340
So therefore the
dipole approximation

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:46.110
is actually the result of an
expansion of the plane wave

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:50.185
e the ikr factor in
units of expansion

00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:51.536
in the fine-structure constant.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.180
OK.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.730
We want to look now
at the second term.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.050
And well, sometimes if
you deal with a term,

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.800
we first make it
more complicated

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.220
and then we simplify it.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.420
I want to sort of symmetrize
and anti-symmetrize it

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.570
in the following way.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:30.150
This is p z x.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:35.890
So let me subtract z p x.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.000
But then, of course,
I have to add it.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.360
So now we have two terms.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.020
1 has a minus sign,
one has a plus sign.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.940
And as will see
in just a minute,

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.690
is the first one is
magnetic dipole transition.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.780
The second one is electric
quadrupole transition.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:11.500
And we see that the first
one can be regarded as-- p

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.890
z x is like p dot r.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.250
Its the y component of
the vector product and

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.334
is therefore the y component of
the orbital angular momentum.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.760
OK.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:40.070
So let's focus for
now on this part.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.850
The second term, which is
the electric quadrupole term,

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.255
we'll do in a few moments.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:54.600
The relevant matrix element
is now the matrix element

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.130
of the orbital
angular momentum Ly.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.930
The p factor-- let
me just collect

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:27.040
all of the constant imaginary
unit ehr AK over 2 mc.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.340
That looks complicated,
but it immediately

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:36.855
simplifies when we realize that
this here is the Bohr magneton.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.132
And well, we still have
the vector potential.

00:51:44.132 --> 00:51:52.040
But the magnetic field is the
curl of the vector potential,

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.120
and that means we will
assume that we have a vector

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.270
potential propagating
in x, polarized in z.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:07.230
That means that our
magnetic field is that.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:13.650
So therefore ka, which
appears in our expression

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.160
for the coupling, is
just the magnetic field.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.720
So therefore we find the
result that the next order

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.940
term in the coupling
of the atoms

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.432
to the electromagnetic
field have the simple form

00:52:27.432 --> 00:52:28.640
to the electromagnetic field.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.660
That it is the
magnetic field part

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:38.240
of the electromagnetic wave
times the Bohr magneton

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:47.480
times the matrix element, due
to the orbital angular momentum

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:47.980
operator.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:55.510
And actually, if you take
the orbital angular momentum

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.890
and multiply it with
the Bohr magneton,

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:04.487
this is actually the operator
of the magnetic moment.

00:53:04.487 --> 00:53:06.820
Well, with a minus sign because
the electron is negative

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.650
charged.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.750
Remember we had
introduced the operator

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.750
for the magnetic moment.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:17.150
And the magnetic
moment was the g factor

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.320
times the Bohr magneton times
the orbital angular momentum.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.320
And the g factor for
the orbital motion is 1.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:32.180
So therefore the interaction
we are talking about

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:37.415
is the Bohr magneton
times the magnetic field.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.440
And, of course, what we
realize is the operator-- maybe

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.230
I should back up for a second
and say what we actually

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:51.625
realize is that
operator which couples

00:53:51.625 --> 00:53:59.640
to the electromagnetic field
has actually the form u dot b.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.070
This is exactly what we use
for the Zeeman effect in a DC

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.570
magnetic field.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:09.720
But now the same
form u dot b appears

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.414
for time dependent
magnetic field.

00:54:12.414 --> 00:54:13.830
And time depending
magnetic fields

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.160
are not only creating
level shifts.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.160
They can also use transitions
through the matrix element.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.540
So in other words,
this whole exercise

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:29.010
show you that the form u dot
b, which appeared naturally

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:31.520
in the formulation
for DC magnetic field,

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.046
also applies to AC
magnetic fields.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.040
But with that, I can
say, wait a moment.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.910
There are now two sources
for the magnetic movement

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.270
of the atom.

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:52.040
One is due to orbital
angular momentum,

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.470
and the other one is due
to spin angular momentum.

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.510
But the spin
angular momentum has

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.995
a g factor, which is different.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:06.220
The approximation of the
[INAUDIBLE] creation is 2.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:10.050
So therefore I
mean, we will never

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.000
get spin out of a
semi-classical discussion.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.945
Remember, we started with a
classical canonical treatment

00:55:16.945 --> 00:55:20.360
of the electromagnetic
field, canonical momentum.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.190
And now we are
running with it and we

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.695
find that there is a coupling
between the magnetic field

00:55:25.695 --> 00:55:28.076
and the magnetic
moment of the atom.

00:55:28.076 --> 00:55:31.325
But, of course, we only get the
magnetic moment to the extent

00:55:31.325 --> 00:55:33.820
that it comes from
orbital motion.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.860
But in a semi-classical way,
I'm waving my hands now and say,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.600
well, what is valid
for the coupling

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.300
to orbit to the magnetic moment
of the orbital angular momentum

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.340
also applies to the speed.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.300
And I'm simply
adding the spin here.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:54.680
And with that, I've
derived for you

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.810
the expression for the
interaction matrix element

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:02.390
called M1.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:08.610
M1 is the magnetic
dipole transitions.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.860
Let me just write it down here.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:25.640
So this is nothing
else than u dot b.

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.420
Any questions?

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.500
Let me just summarize.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.580
You may find it
sort of interesting,

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.450
when we discussed static
electric and static magnetic

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.950
fields.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.900
For the static
electric field, we

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.220
had an electric field
times the dipole.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.590
And we find this now as
a time independent term

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:04.760
which can drive transitions
for interactions with time

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.310
dependent electromagnetic
field, but we find it

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.110
in the dipole approximation.

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:12.980
The magnetic part,
u dot b, we find

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.490
when we go to the next order.

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:17.740
We find it as a
magnetic dipole term.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.940
But there are more
terms, and I just

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.560
want you to illustrate
that and then

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.320
I'll stop with that
multiple expansion.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:40.815
We had the second term,
the kr term, was this one.

00:57:40.815 --> 00:57:42.440
But then we sort of
anti-symmetrized it

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.380
and symmetrized it.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:48.800
The first one here, we could
relate to orbital angular

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.065
momentum and to the
magnetic moment.

00:57:51.065 --> 00:57:53.065
And now I would want to
discuss the second term.

00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:07.540
So that term uses a mixture
of position and momentum

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.040
operators.

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:22.860
But we know already how we can
get rid of momentum operators,

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.076
namely by expressing momentum
operators as commutators

00:58:28.076 --> 00:58:28.950
with the Hamiltonian.

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:43.820
So this gives us the commutator
of z with H naught times x

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:50.380
plus z times the commutator
of x with H naught.

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:05.570
OK.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.870
So we have two commutators.

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.910
Each of them has two terms.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.260
That means a total
of four terms.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.720
And if you write
them down, you see

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.690
that two are opposite
but equal and cancel.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:22.970
So therefore we are left
with two terms, which

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:31.370
are minus H naught zx
plus zx times H naught.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:43.480
So this term has now the
following contribution

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:55.890
to the coupling between
the levels A and B.

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:59.850
So we have this
coupling matrix element.

01:00:08.455 --> 01:00:13.495
We have b factor mc Am.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.010
OK.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:26.065
So using the same approach
we used for the dipole matrix

01:00:26.065 --> 01:00:30.630
element, the H naught can act on
the state A on the right side,

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:34.000
and can act on the state
B on the left hand side.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.810
So this gives us simply
the energy difference.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.620
And what is left is
now a matrix element

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.570
which only involves
position operators,

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.980
but it uses a product of 2.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:07.320
And now, again, we express
the vector potential

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.660
by the electric field,
as we had done before.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:27.270
And therefore we have now
expressed our coupling yes,

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.620
by an electric field.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.430
And we assume that in the
near resonant approximation,

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.520
as we had used for
the dipole coupling,

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.195
that this is the
frequency omega.

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:46.570
OK.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.440
So what we are
realizing is that we

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.660
have one part of the
interaction Hamiltonian

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.440
which couples levels
A and B, has--

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.670
we call it E2, this
electric quadrupole

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:11.945
because it involves elements
of the quadrupole tensor,

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:18.262
or products of coordinates
x, y, y, z, x, z.

01:02:18.262 --> 01:02:21.870
And for this geometry, which
we assume with our plane wave,

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:22.680
it is z, x.

01:02:26.026 --> 01:02:27.980
It couples to the
electric field.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:36.460
And this is the p factor.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.410
For a more general
geometry of plane waves

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.740
with different polarization
going in different directions,

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:51.570
we would have obtained different
products of coordinates.

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:56.890
So let me indicate that, that
what we have picked out here

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.290
is one specific component
of a tensor, which

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:06.590
is sort of the tensor form
by using the position vector

01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:07.520
r twice.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:17.340
So in this derivation,
we found when

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.730
we go beyond the
dipole approximation,

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:26.202
when we take the kr term
in leading order, that we

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.160
have two contributions.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:35.280
One is M1, magnetic dipole.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.761
The other one was
electric quadrupole.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:47.420
We realized-- I tried to
keep of all the p factors--

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:57.840
that the electric quadrupole
matrix element is imaginary,

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.350
whereas the magnetic
dipole was u dot b.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:02.850
There was no imaginary unit.

01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:03.350
It's real.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:13.620
That means that you will
never have any interference

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.040
effect between magnetic dipole
and electric quadrupole.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.420
Or in other words,
when we have processes

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.240
like spontaneous
emission where we

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.670
take the square of
the matrix element,

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:31.230
the square of the
matrix element will

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:38.370
be the sum of the squares
of the matrix element

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:41.766
for magnetic dipole and
electric quadrupole transitions.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.878
So let me summarize.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:05.630
We have discussed
three different ways

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:12.100
how we can have coupling
matrix elements between two

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.551
states, electric
dipole, magnetic dipole,

01:05:17.551 --> 01:05:24.140
electric quadrupole, E1, M1, E2.

01:05:30.355 --> 01:05:35.640
The operator was the
electric dipole operator.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.660
Here it was the operator of
the magnetic movement, which

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:48.430
is orbital angular momentum
and spin angular momentum.

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:53.430
And for the quadrupole, it
was the quadratic expression

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.815
in the spatial coordinates.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.690
You can also ask
what is the parity?

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:08.060
The electric dipole
operator connects

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.090
states with opposite parity,
whereas both magnetic dipole

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.900
and electric quadrupole
connect states

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.828
even with the same parity.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:31.162
Magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole transition

01:06:31.162 --> 01:06:34.310
are often called
forbidden transitions.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.520
Well, you would say it's
a misnomer because they

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.790
are transitions, so they are
allowed, but they are weak.

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:46.550
But this is the language we use.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:48.750
Weak transitions
are forbidden, which

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.900
simply means they don't appear.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.520
They are forbidden
in leading order,

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.124
but when you go to higher
order, they are allowed.

01:06:55.124 --> 01:06:57.540
You can, of course, say if
they were completely forbidden,

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.520
there would be no
need to discuss them.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.800
But since they
are only forbidden

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.035
at a certain level,
then, of course,

01:07:04.035 --> 01:07:05.410
it's interesting
to discuss them.

01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.310
And a lot of narrow
transitions which

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:10.035
are relevant for atomic
clocks are highly forbidden

01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:10.535
transitions.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.490
The strength of them, which
usually scales with transitions

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:21.270
with the square of
the matrix element,

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:25.410
is on the order of 5
times 10 to the minus 5.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:28.570
So those transitions
are four or five orders

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:38.400
of magnitude weaker Yeah than
an allowed E1 transition.

01:07:44.822 --> 01:07:46.798
So that's what they are.

01:07:57.166 --> 01:07:57.666
Questions?

01:08:06.064 --> 01:08:09.028
AUDIENCE: When people talk about
highly forbidden transitions,

01:08:09.028 --> 01:08:13.026
does this mean that's like
a optical transition, or how

01:08:13.026 --> 01:08:15.814
do we distinguish it from
just regularly forbidden?

01:08:17.351 --> 01:08:19.559
PROFESSOR: Actually I would
say forbidden transitions

01:08:19.559 --> 01:08:22.590
are weaker by alpha
to the power n.

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:24.800
Here we have situations
where the matrix

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.700
element is just
smaller by alpha.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:27.725
But, yes.

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:38.474
Sometimes, yes.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.180
Some transitions are
highly forbidden.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.310
For instance-- I
try to remember--

01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:48.620
if you have hydrogen 1s and 2s.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.787
Because of s states--
actually, you

01:08:52.787 --> 01:08:55.120
are asking question about the
next chapter, namely about

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.285
selection rules.

01:08:57.285 --> 01:08:59.029
Let me give it in words.

01:08:59.029 --> 01:09:01.779
The s, if you
connect two s states,

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:04.076
they have both 0
angular momentum.

01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:04.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.353
PROFESSOR: So you cannot have a
quadrupole operator connecting

01:09:07.353 --> 01:09:08.290
the two.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:12.060
It would violate
the triangle rule.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.840
You cannot have angular momentum
of 0 and angular momentum of 2

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.840
and get angular momentum of 0.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.010
So therefore you
have a transition

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.970
between two states
of the same parity.

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:22.990
There is no dipole operator.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.410
There is no quadrupole operator.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.086
So you soon run into a situation
where it's highly forbidden.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:35.330
Sometimes you have the situation
that something is forbidden

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.877
in non-relativistic
physics, but they're

01:09:37.877 --> 01:09:39.710
a relativistic term,
which makes it allowed.

01:09:43.116 --> 01:09:46.270
Well, there's also
that relativistic terms

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.859
are fine-structure terms is
also an expansion alpha squared.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:52.149
So the symmetry may
allow it, but only

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:54.730
in connection with
relativistic terms.

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:56.610
I'm not an expert on
forbidden transitions,

01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:01.700
but usually you have transitions
which are multiply forbidden.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.860
They are forbidden
by spacial symmetry.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.640
For instance, in
the helium atom,

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.640
singular triplet are
forbidden by spin symmetry.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.060
So if you have multiple
layers of being forbidden,

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.400
then you get extremely
weak transitions.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.786
And one example, actually, are
the singular triplet transition

01:10:20.786 --> 01:10:25.260
in helium, or the 1s to
2s transition in hydrogen.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.650
They are not allowed
by simply going

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:32.050
to the next order in
a multiple expansion.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:32.550
Yes?

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:35.022
AUDIENCE: In ordinary
situations when

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.827
you do have to possibly do at
least even more [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:37.827 --> 01:10:38.910
for the other transitions?

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.930
PROFESSOR: I'm not
an expert on that.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:47.450
I'm not sure if there
is an atom which

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.550
has a relevant transition which
is a [INAUDIBLE] transition.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:53.380
I've not heard about that.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:57.300
At least relevant examples
which are the fundamental atoms,

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.600
helium and hydrogen.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.580
For hydrogen, at the
2s to 1 transition,

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.060
the leading order
is the emission,

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.670
the simultaneous
emission of two photons.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.730
So you have not
just one photon, you

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:14.636
have two photons which,
of course, requires

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:17.928
in the perturbation
expansion the immediate step.

01:11:17.928 --> 01:11:19.302
We discuss two
photon transitions

01:11:19.302 --> 01:11:20.960
at the end of this course.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.930
So in that case, it's
not in higher order

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:26.010
in the single photon
multiple expansion,

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:29.990
it becomes a
multi-photon transition.

01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:31.865
So this is one relevant case.

01:11:31.865 --> 01:11:37.580
And for helium,
triplet to singlet,

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.385
this involves
relativistic physics.

01:11:42.258 --> 01:11:45.300
Actually, I mentioned it in
the other class on helium.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.739
I tried to look it up
and I want to show here,

01:11:47.739 --> 01:11:49.780
you have to go to this
order to get a transition.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:51.820
But when I tried to look
into the literature,

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.650
I couldn't find a clear answer.

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.420
Ultimately, it was
a relativistic term

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.410
in the fully
relativistic formulation

01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:01.620
of the coupling of
electromagnetic fields

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.880
to the atom.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.550
I'm not sure if you can put a
label on it and it would say,

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:09.210
this is this and
this order term.

01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:11.510
It may actually
involve-- and we know

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.600
that this happens in the
[INAUDIBLE] creation--

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.020
that spin and spacial degrees
become treated together

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:21.226
in the [INAUDIBLE] creation, and
maybe it's one of those terms.

01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:24.530
Yes?

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:26.113
AUDIENCE: So what's
the actual meaning

01:12:26.113 --> 01:12:28.877
of interacting with
different Hamiltonians?

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:32.947
Like, you wrote square root
of Hamiltonians and then--

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:33.530
PROFESSOR: No.

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:37.585
I meant actually the square
of the matrix element.

01:12:37.585 --> 01:12:38.126
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:12:38.126 --> 01:12:38.625
Sorry.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:43.630
PROFESSOR: If you have,
for instance-- actually

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:45.650
I will talk about it in
the next lecture when

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.880
we discuss Fermi's golden rule.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.400
The transition strength
in Fermi's golden rule

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.710
is proportionate to the
square of the matrix element.

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:55.690
But now you would ask
the question, well,

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:58.310
could we have some
interference between the two

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.670
different processes?

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.870
And I wanted to point
out at this level

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:05.670
that we don't, because one
matrix element is imaginary,

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:07.100
the other one is real.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.100
And if you take the complex
matrix element between two

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:14.210
states and calculate
the square, the square

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:17.950
of the complex matrix element
is the square of the real part

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:19.680
plus the square of
the imaginary part,

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.730
and there's no interference
trend between the two.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.410
So in other words, if you have
an atom which has a weak decay

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:29.950
through M1 and a weak
decay through quadrupole,

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:33.380
the two parts cannot
destructively interfere,

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.575
because one is real,
one is imaginary.

01:13:35.575 --> 01:13:39.429
They add up in quadrature,
That's what I wanted to say.

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:44.790
OK.

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:49.040
So these were examples of
higher order transitions.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:55.420
And as the questions
have shown, this

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:59.130
leads us to a discussion
of selection rules.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:06.510
Selection rules is nothing
else than a classification

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:10.120
of possible transitions
according to symmetry.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.300
And it's a way of using well,
[INAUDIBLE] coefficients,

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.650
angular momentum coupling,
or using, you would say,

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:25.140
symmetry to figure out
if matrix elements are

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.740
non-vanishing or vanishing.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.540
And I gave you
already one example,

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.520
and I want to formalize it now.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.230
If you go between two s states
which have 0 angular momentum,

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:37.400
you cannot have an operator
which is a quadrupole operator

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.910
because-- and this is what
I want to tell you now--

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:43.385
the quadrupole operator is a
spherical tensor with two units

01:14:43.385 --> 01:14:45.056
of angular momentum.

01:14:45.056 --> 01:14:47.730
And this would forbid
the triangle rule.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:52.440
This would forbid "conservation"
of angular momentum.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.080
So that's what I want to
discuss now in the next chapter,

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.470
or at least get started
for the next five minutes

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:02.110
by discussing selection rules.

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:04.960
So the introduction
to selection rules

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.750
is that we have
forbidden transitions.

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:13.480
Forbidden transitions
are suppressed

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.890
because we are forced
to go to higher order,

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:18.710
and this is usually
higher order in alpha.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:23.680
So forbidden transitions are
weaker by some power of alpha.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.020
And that means they require
higher approximations.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:37.410
And, of course, the
comparison is always

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:38.630
the dipole transition.

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:40.785
This is the dominant transition.

01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:44.030
This is the industrial
strengths transition.

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:47.470
And from there on,
it can get weaker.

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:52.398
So if can get weaker
by multiple expansion.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.390
We've just discussed that.

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:03.750
It can get weaker
because you have

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:07.810
to have a cascade of
dipole transitions.

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.800
This would be
multi-photon processes,

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.640
as we discuss later
in the course.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.810
It can get weaker
because they are exactly

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:20.670
0 in a non-relativistic
approximation

01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:24.120
and require
relativistic effects.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.740
The example we have
encountered in this course

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.560
is the singlet to triplet
transition in helium.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.410
Or there are transitions which
would not be allowed just

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:52.260
for the electron, but if we
invoke hyperfine interactions

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.070
with a nucleus, then
they become allowed.

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:03.720
So it's a rich subject, and I'm
not an expert and I cannot do

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.150
full justice to it.

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:15.220
But I want to at least give
you some general rules how

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:16.921
we discussed matrix elements.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.880
So what is always a good
quantum number, what is always

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:31.100
a label for our atomic
states is angular momentum.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.070
Because atoms [INAUDIBLE]
through space,

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.930
and there is
rotation in variance.

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:41.600
So we always categorize our
atoms with angular momentum

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.740
with the quantum numbers JM.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.980
And we are asking,
are there transitions

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.670
between a state JM to a
state J prime M prime?

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:54.370
And all other
quantum numbers, we

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.520
can now summarize
with a label n.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.220
And now we have an operator.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.420
I gave you examples
for the operator.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:06.745
The magnetic moment,
the electric dipole,

01:18:06.745 --> 01:18:09.010
the quadrupole operator.

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:13.100
But in general, every
operator can be written,

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.706
can be expanded, in a
sum of spherical tensors.

01:18:17.706 --> 01:18:19.456
So what is discussed
in the classification

01:18:19.456 --> 01:18:21.450
of matrix elements.

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:26.220
Our matrix elements
involving components,

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.870
the operator are components
of a spherical tensor.

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:41.130
So T is a spherical
tensor of rank l.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:44.300
And if you want a
simple definition

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.420
of what is a
spherical tensor, you

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:53.400
try to write an operator--
like the position operator

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:58.100
r-- you try to write
it as a sum of terms,

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.980
and each term transforms like
a spherical harmonic Ylm.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.370
So in other words, we
can write every operator

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:11.230
as a sum of spherical tensors.

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:13.730
And a spherical tensor
is characterized

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:25.160
that it transforms
under rotations exactly

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:32.480
as the spherical harmonics Ylm.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:46.385
so every operator is now a
sum of spherical tensors.

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:54.200
I don't want to get too much
into symmetry classification,

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.859
but the story is that you
know the Ylm functions are

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:58.775
compensator functions.

01:19:58.775 --> 01:20:01.880
Every function can be expanded
and swell to harmonics.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.330
And similarly, if
you have an operator,

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:08.770
you can decompose
it into objects

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:12.410
which transform under
rotation, and it's the Ylms.

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:15.810
So you have a part
which transforms

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.380
according to an object.

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.420
And Ylm is the classification
of wave functions

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.220
with angular momentum.

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:27.550
And so therefore each operator
may not have a specific angular

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:31.350
momentum, but can be written
as the sum of operators,

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:34.660
each of which has
the same symmetry,

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.690
the same transformation
properties,

01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:38.676
as a state of angular momentum.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:43.330
And I think I should
stop here, but let

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:47.030
me just give you
the final message.

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:51.510
So by doing that, by
separating the operator

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:54.885
into a sum of spherical tensors,
we are actually now back

01:20:54.885 --> 01:20:57.010
in angular momentum.

01:20:57.010 --> 01:20:58.815
If you have a matrix
element-- and just

01:20:58.815 --> 01:21:02.690
think how you calculate it in
the Schrodinger representation.

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.260
You have a wave
function, operator,

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.850
and a wave function
we indicate go by.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:11.680
So what you have is, you have
the product of the objects.

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:20.070
And now we can classify
them by angular momentum.

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:24.820
And this is what I will
show you in the next class,

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.720
is that ultimately the question
whether this matrix element is

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.410
0 or not will boil
down to the question

01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:35.000
whether J prime and M
prime angular momentum

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.960
can be added to l and m.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.116
And there is overlap with
angular momentum of JM.

01:21:40.116 --> 01:21:44.209
So we are back to the rules
for adding angular momentum.

01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.250
We get the triangle rule.

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.502
We get the [INAUDIBLE]
quote unquote [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:51.450
OK.

01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:53.380
Enjoy the spring break,
and we meet on Monday

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.530
after the spring break.

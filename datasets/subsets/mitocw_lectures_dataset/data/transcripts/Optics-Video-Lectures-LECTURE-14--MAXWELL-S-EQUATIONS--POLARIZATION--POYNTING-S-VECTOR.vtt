00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:26.020
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right, everyone,
we're going to start now.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.420
So my name is Colin
Sheppard, and I'm going

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.510
to be giving the lecture today.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.880
George is here to
keep me in order,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.580
and I think, probably,
he'll come up

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.570
with some comments
at times, maybe--

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.070
I hope, anyway.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.880
So he started off by saying that
there's no real announcements

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.770
except that he's changed--

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.710
he's uploaded some
revised notes, apparently.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:05.140
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: There were
some minor error in the notes,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.980
so I have--

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.570
I have fixed them.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.500
And the current
versions should be--

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.810
the one that's in the website
now is the corrected ones.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.680
COLIN SHEPPARD: All right, so
only minor changes, I think.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.590
OK, so I'm going
to try and take off

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.040
from where George
left it, which was

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.510
with Maxwell's equations and
the derivation of the wave

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.010
equation.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.870
It's quite nice to see this
derivation of the wave equation

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.730
starting from
Maxwell's equations,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.940
because it brings everything
together and allows

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.250
you to see how the--

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.570
these different areas of
physics are interrelated.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.750
But normally, of
course, in optics, we

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.710
don't usually go to the
electromagnetic-type theory,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.380
so we usually get as far
as the wave equation.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.230
We show the existence
of simple forms

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.030
like plane waves
and spherical waves.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.180
We carry on then using those
plane waves and spherical

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.070
waves in a simplified form.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.900
But anyway, so back to
Maxwell's equations.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900
These were the
Maxwell's equations.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.400
George, before, explained
these and tried to--

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.610
I'm not going to go through
the meaning of them,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.400
again, because I
think you've got that.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.410
But in the differential
form, you've

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.150
just got these four equations
connecting the electric field

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.160
and the magnetic field, right?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300
So you'll see that
there's two E's there.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.940
Sorry, there's three E's,
and then there's three B's.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.955
And then there's a charge
row and a current that's CJ.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.110
So how we get the wave equation
from that is quite simple.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.270
It's just a case of doing a
bit of vector manipulation.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.230
Curl E, you can see,
is minus the Bdt

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.890
from the Maxwell's equations.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.060
So if you take the curl
of both sides of that,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.580
you get this equation.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.430
And curl B is another of
the Maxwell's equations,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.480
so you can substitute in
from the Maxwell's equation

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.670
into this one, and then
you'll get another equation.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900
What you get after that George
hasn't actually written here,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.660
but basically, what
you'd obviously get then,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
this is curl of this, so it's
going to be curl of curl.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.540
So this is what you actually
end up with, is curl, curl,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.260
curl E is going to be--

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.620
and then the other term
is going to be something--

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.790
a second derivative in the E. So
actually, that equation, maybe

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.530
I'll write it down.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.019
It's not actually written
there, but after you've just

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.050
done that substitution,
you'll get something

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.250
like-- is this thing
working, or-- yeah, it is.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:34.820
You'd get something like
curl of curl E. There we are.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.210
Now you can see it.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.590
A lot of people right cross
product like that, as a little,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.380
sort of upside down V.
Curl curl E plus mu naught

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.080
epsilon naught, d2, edt
squared equals naught,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.720
is I think what you
get after you've just

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.940
substituted that in there.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.490
And then finally--
so this is-- this

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.250
has still got this thing,
curl of curl E, which

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.290
is quite complicated
if you try and work out

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.400
what that is in spherical
polars or something,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.790
especially if you're expressing
E as something which is

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.130
spatially varying or whatever.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.920
This could be quite
a complicated thing

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.140
to have to work out.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.210
But anyway, but the-- you can
get it into a slightly more

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.430
usable form--

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.020
often we do this--

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.890
by using this
identity, curl curl E

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.760
is equal to grad of div
E minus Del squared E.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.400
It calls it here an identity.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.460
Really, it's actually
the definition

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.620
of what this thing means.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.685
And this is not obvious,
what this means, actually.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.940
But these other
things, OK, they're

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.800
well defined, what they mean.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.530
This thing is
actually just what it

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.880
says in Cartesian
coordinates, so you

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.050
know you've got Del is
equal to ddx in the I

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.730
direction, plus ddy
in the J direction,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.440
plus dd zed in the K direction.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.130
So Del squared is going
to be this dot this,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.360
which is going to be d2 Del
squared equals d2, dx squared,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.600
plus d2, dy squared,
plus d2, d zed squared.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.250
And you'll notice that
that's exactly the same form

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.880
as the normal Laplacian, right?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.820
So the lower
Laplacian you've had

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.000
before, Del squared of a
scalar, but this is different,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.990
because this is Del
squared of a vector.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.070
So what we're saying is that,
for Cartesian coordinates,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.610
if we define Del squared
of a vector by this thing,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.090
we find that it's got
exactly the same form

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.830
as Del squared of a scalar.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.480
Now, that doesn't
actually work with

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.840
any other coordinate system,
so that's a bit of a warning.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.760
If you go into sphericals
or cylindrical coordinates,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.530
you'll find that this
Del squared of a vector

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.200
is not the same as
Del squared that you

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.190
would use for a scalar.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.170
But nevertheless, let's do that.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.320
We stick in this as being that.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.100
And then we look
at this term here,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.880
and mostly, we're going to be
interested in, for example,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.630
regions where
there's no charges.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.610
And very often,
also, we're going

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.450
to be interested
in isotropic media.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.950
If these things are true, you
know that div D equals row,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:10.070
so Div d is equal to naught
if there's no charges, which

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.790
means that Div E is equal to
naught if there's no charges,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.130
and it's also isotropic.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.000
So I'm saying this
all out in length

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.310
because you have to be very
careful about this, sometimes.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.180
Div E equals naught is only
true if you've got no charges,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.620
and it's an isotropic medium.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.140
So if you've got, for example,
let's say a diffraction

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.120
grating, where you've got some
variations in permittivity,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.360
then in general, you can't
actually assume this,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.720
because epsilon is changing.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.770
And therefore, with
div D equals naught,

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.520
div epsilon doesn't
equal naught.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.370
But if you're in free space or
some constant isotopic medium,

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.520
this is true.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.600
So this term goes,
and so this is just

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.710
equal to minus Del squared.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.460
And so you can see then,
this Dell squared then

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.270
is just replaced by this, and
we got a sign change there.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.880
So this is the final expression.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.950
And you'll notice then
that this is exactly

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.790
the same form as the
normal wave equation

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.660
that we're very used
to in this scalar form,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.550
except that the scalar
is replaced by a vector.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.300
So that's really very nice.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.480
Yeah, so comparing with
that wave equation,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.330
this is the normal wave
equation we've had,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.750
the scalar wave equation before,
and you can see then they're

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.420
exactly the same, except
that the scalar is

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.250
replaced by a vector.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.980
And the one over
c squared, where

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.470
c is the velocity
of the wave, is

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.900
replaced by this thing,
so we can say then

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.030
that 1 over c squared is equal
to mu naught epsilon naught,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.770
and that gives us then c is
1 over the square root of mu

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.910
naught epsilon naught.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.330
And so here, there are
some figures put in,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:21.610
and we get the expression for
the speed of light in vacuum.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.360
So that's very neat.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.910
I guess Maxwell must
have been really amazed

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.855
when he did this sum.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.690
You don't know, of course, the
actual history of the thing,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.840
but he played around with
these equations, didn't he?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.040
And he came up with this
form which looked nicely

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.810
symmetrical to him.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.290
And then he comes out with
an expression, comes out

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.800
with a value, for the speed
of light that it predicts,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.260
which is what they
already knew was true.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.500
So he must have felt
really as though he

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.350
was going to get the
Nobel Prize or something.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.090
But probably, I
don't know-- maybe

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:06.060
it was before the Nobel
Prize, so quite interesting.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.670
And actually, Naveen
was telling me

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.200
that he'd been looking at the
original paper by Maxwell.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.250
Maxwell's equations, if you look
in the original, are horrible,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.860
because he doesn't--

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.640
this terminology for vectors
wasn't invented then.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.640
So it's done all in
terms of components,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.980
horribly complicated.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.980
And I think Naveen
said it was the--

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.290
Heaviside who actually really
derived the Maxwell's equations

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:43.410
in the form that we know
and love so well nowadays.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.925
Heaviside you might remember,
he's famous for a few things,

00:11:46.925 --> 00:11:48.300
but one of them
is a thing called

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.150
the Heaviside function, which
is basically a step function.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.820
And the other thing is
the Heaviside layer,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:02.150
which is an ionic
layer in the ionosphere

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.160
that he reflects
radio waves from.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.880
OK, so that's all
about free space.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.690
So how can we now
deal with matter?

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.320
Well, it turns out actually
there's lots of different ways

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.360
you can deal with--

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.870
lots of levels you can
deal with propagation

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.710
of electromagnetic
waves in matter.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.370
You can, for example,
treat it really

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.740
from a proper atomic
point of view.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.160
You can think of the
material being made up

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:48.500
of atoms which have got nuclei
and electrons clouds and so on.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.290
Or you can think of
it in terms of matter

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.510
just being like an
isotropic material, where

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.460
you don't really go into
the microscopic view of it,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.270
but just think of it
in a macroscopic way.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.880
And actually, to some degree,
I think that, very often,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.270
the second of those is just as
well, because normally, we're

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.800
not really interested in the
actual atomic nature of where

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.540
these properties come from.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.020
But this is going back to how
you can think of it, really,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.060
in terms of atoms.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.770
So as you know,
atoms are made up

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.010
of a nucleus with
an electron cloud.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.300
And the nucleus is
relatively fixed,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.830
of course, because it's
heavy, but the electron cloud,

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.260
because the electrons
are much lighter,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.300
can be moved around by
the field that's supplied.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.520
So you get the distortion
of the electron cloud.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.940
So this is what this
is showing here.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.180
It's showing here
the nucleus here,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.840
which is pretty well fixed,
because it's so heavy.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.900
And then this
electron cloud, you

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.180
can think of it like being
joined to the nucleus

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.980
by a lot of springs.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.730
And then the electrostatic--

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.580
the forces on that
electric cloud

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.010
caused by the electric field
will tend to, for example,

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.500
displace the electron cloud
relative to the nucleus.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.870
So it gets sort of distorted.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.960
And the way that's described is
in terms of a property called

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.200
the polarization then.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.000
So this is showing how--

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.060
you can see that if you
move the negative charges

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.280
relative to the
positive charges,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.680
you'll set up a sort
of dipole moment.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.620
Separate the charges, you've
got a plus and a minus.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.430
They're separated in distance,
so that acts like a dipole.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.590
So that acts like a--

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.020
gives you a dipole
moment, and then

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.170
if you sum over all
those dipole moments,

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.530
you'll get the
total polarization

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.550
effects of applying that field.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:08.450
So what that does then is
introduces these charge

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:17.450
variations, which distort
the charge that you really

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.120
have there, which is caused
by the bound charges.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.600
So this is what we get.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240
You can say that
div D equals row,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.440
so div E is equal to row over
epsilon naught, assuming the--

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.450
yeah, well, this is--
epsilon naught, of course,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.060
is really a constant.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:43.250
And we are breaking this up into
it's bound-and-free components,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.620
and we're saying
that the free part--

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.870
we've got something wrong
with this again, haven't we?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.260
Sorry, that should say--

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.040
that should say free
there, shouldn't it?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.800
Yeah.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.360
The free part and the
bound part is this part,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.880
and so this is it,
the final result then.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.760
We can now take the epsilon
naught the other side,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.920
take this the other
side, and we get

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:17.170
the div of epsilon naught E plus
P is equal to the free charges,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:17.770
right?

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.290
And then this thing
in brackets here

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.420
is what we call D, the
displacement in the medium.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.660
So it's like if you've
got this medium,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.520
div D equals row
is what we know is

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:38.140
the normal expression that we
write from Maxwell's equations.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.670
And now, we've derived
that that D, in the medium,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.350
can be written in terms of the
polarization of the molecules

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.700
that make up the medium.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.500
So how do these things connect?

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.570
This shows us how
we do this then.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:00.010
So we've got D equals
epsilon naught E plus P. Now,

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.110
in general, of course,
we don't really

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.150
know what this
does at the moment.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:12.550
And in general, it can be
very complicated, actually.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.500
It can be a non-linear
relationship

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.369
with the electric field.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.760
But if I go back
again to the diagram,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.109
you'll see that
this is a bit like--

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.050
you know, you've
got springs here.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.750
Hooke's law tells
us, in mechanics,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:34.390
if a system obeys Hooke's
law, then the extension

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.242
is proportional to the--

00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:39.760
the tension is-- what is it?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.838
Extension is proportional
to the attention.

00:17:42.838 --> 00:17:44.380
Sorry, I'm not a
mechanical engineer,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.450
so I don't know these things.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.680
So you'd expect the same would
be true-- could be the same--

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.000
could be true here.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.480
If you're only applying a
very weak field on here,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.200
then you might think that this
relationship might be linear.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.490
You'll get these springs
behaving like Hooke's law,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.770
so you'll get a linear
relationship between P and D.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.540
Now, also, in analogy with the
mechanical situation-- yeah?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.900
STUDENT: So if we're in a
mat-- like in a material,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.570
why is it the permitivity
of free space and not just

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.220
the permittivity
of the material?

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.260
Like why is it epsilon
naught and not epsilon?

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:31.180
COLIN SHEPPARD: Why is
it epsilon naught here

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.230
that you can write this?

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.350
This is either you can
think of as epsilon naught--

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.140
epsilon E, or you
can think of it

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.570
as epsilon naught
E plus P. So these

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.638
are two alternative
ways of looking

00:18:46.638 --> 00:18:47.680
at the same thing, right?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:57.190
So we've got D equals
epsilon naught E plus P,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.660
and you can think of
this as being epsilon E.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.670
So we're just about to carry
onto this on the next slide,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:05.170
actually.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.770
So that, you can see, tells us
that there is a relationship

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:15.160
now between epsilon
and P, right?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.620
We're going to look what
that relationship is.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.370
But in general, it's
actually quite complicated,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.100
because we don't know the
relationship between P and E

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.970
yet, right?

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.350
So what I'm trying to
establish at the moment is

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.080
that if this thing--

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.770
if the fields are very
weak, then you'd expect,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.020
maybe, a linear relationship.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.150
P will be proportional
to E. So this term here

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.900
will also be something
times E, and so

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.620
you'll be able to take out
E as a factor from this.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.900
Now, this is only going to be
true if this electric field is

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.870
weak compared with the--

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.840
you know, if the force
due to the electric field

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.850
is weak compared with the
forces involved in the binding

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.430
the electrons to the nucleus.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:14.410
And I suppose it was probably
not until the invention

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.230
of the laser that probably
even people thought

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.950
you could ever
possibly get to a case

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.390
where that might not be true.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.420
But now, of course, we
know, if you've got a laser,

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.600
you can make really big fields.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.660
You can get, very easily,
into this rate regime where

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.050
this polarization changes.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:39.100
And so you'll get
non-linear-type terms coming.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.593
You're not going to do
this at all in the course.

00:20:42.593 --> 00:20:44.260
But there is this
whole area, of course,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.300
of non-linear optics, which is
when this linear approximation

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.110
breaks down.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.870
So here we are.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.850
So this is back to this, what
I said, D equals epsilon E. OK,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.270
so that's really the
answer to your question.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:13.350
And the D equals epsilon E, but
D equals this other expression,

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.620
epsilon naught E plus
P. And now, we say

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.080
that P is proportional to E.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.770
This Chi is called the
electrics susceptibility,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.550
which I think is a confusing
term because it's often,

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.950
in practice, just
called susceptibility.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.260
People just neglect
the electric bit.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.542
But of course, there is also
a magnetic susceptibility

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.000
which is very
important when you're

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.760
doing magnetic materials.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.040
And unfortunately,
people use Chi for that

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.220
too, so that really gets people
confused if you're not careful.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.330
So we're not going to be
doing anything with magnetism,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.520
so maybe it's no problem for us.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.950
But anyway, this is the
electric susceptibility.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:04.110
So we can put in our P as
Chi E, and therefore, D

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.820
equals epsilon naught
1 plus Chi times E.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.080
And this is equal to
epsilon E, as we've said.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.370
And you can see then,
we have that epsilon

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.110
must equal this thing, epsilon
equals epsilon naught 1

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.665
plus Chi.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.200
And this is a another
expression we've had before,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.830
in terms of the refractive
index, so you can write

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.510
the permittivity, the
relative permittivity,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.640
in terms of refractive
index, right?

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.940
So this is the refractive
index coming in here.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.710
So under refractive index
then is the square root of 1

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.480
plus Chi.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.130
And so you see how all
these things are connected.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.050
You could also say,
one more, of course.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.270
Where are we?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.960
Yeah, we could
say that we've got

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.010
n squared equals
1 plus Chi, so Chi

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.155
is equal to n squared minus 1.

00:23:08.155 --> 00:23:13.880
So this is another sort of form
you might come across at times.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.110
You can see then, we
know in free space--

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.100
free space, n is 1,
so this thing is 0.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.282
So there is no
polarization of free space,

00:23:23.282 --> 00:23:25.490
which is what we know,
because there's nothing in it.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.310
So there's nothing to polarize.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.610
OK?

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.450
So, yeah, this bottom
bit just says that you

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.460
can do the same for magnetism.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.460
You can do virtually the
same sort of expansions

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.040
for magnetism, but
we're not going

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.200
to deal with this, because
we're not going to deal

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.570
with magnetic materials at all.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.600
But there are some
quite interesting,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.300
you know, magneto optic
materials and so on,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.060
which are quite
important actually,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.680
nowadays, in terms of things
like optical data storage

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.050
and so on.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:11.000
We're just going to be assuming
that, from the magnetic point

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.830
of view, the
material just behaves

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:18.680
exactly the same as free space,
so B equals mu naught H. Yeah?

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.330
STUDENT: The electric
polarization subtracts

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.560
the field out of the original.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.600
Polarization adds the
field, magnetization

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.320
subtracts the field.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.195
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.600
[INAUDIBLE] has asked this
question of why this is a plus,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.940
and this is a minus.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.510
And the answer is,
I think it's all

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.730
to do with all these
horrible things you

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.780
learn about in magnetism, dire
magnetism and paramagnetism.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.560
And sometimes, it's
whether they oppose

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.590
the change to which they were
due and all that sort of stuff.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.650
So I think it's just
a case of whether--

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.490
if you define
magnetization in the way

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.350
that it's normally done, then it
turns out there's a minus sign,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.250
but I think you could equally
well have defined it as being

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.740
the opposite side, actually.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.510
Yeah.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.670
I don't really know
much about magnetism,

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.680
so don't ask me too
much about that.

00:25:23.902 --> 00:25:25.360
STUDENT: Also, I
think it has to do

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.220
with the part of
the stuff that--

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.500
B is actually the conjugate
of the electric displacement.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.700
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.942
STUDENT: So it includes the
effect of magnetization.

00:25:35.942 --> 00:25:37.900
So another way to put it
is if you could please

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:43.180
go back one, if you
solve this, if you

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.450
take M to the other side,
then multiply it by mu naught,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.408
then you'll get exactly
the question as before.

00:25:48.408 --> 00:25:50.033
COLIN SHEPPARD: Of
course that's right.

00:25:50.033 --> 00:25:51.550
If you just expand
this out, you get

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.180
B equals mu naught H
plus M, so it would

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.850
be exactly the same form then.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.420
STUDENT: So the field
is actually H, not B.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.950
The conjugate of the
electric field, E,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.390
is the magnetic field, H,
not B. B is the induction.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.590
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.090
OK.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.990
So now then, let's write down
those Maxwell's equations

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.470
for these various
different cases.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.060
So this is how you can
write them in vacuum.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.370
That's how we first
came across them.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.620
And if you've got vacuum, and in
addition, you've got no charges

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.210
and no currents, then of course,
this term, this will be 0,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.500
and this J will also be 0.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.540
And now, you can see that
they look nicely symmetrical.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.920
These two are both equal to 0,
and these things are both equal

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:56.810
to a first-- a time derivative,
but there is a difference

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.130
of a sine--

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.910
but apart from that,
nicely symmetrical.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.680
And then the middle
row here says,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.230
if you've got some
matter, and it's still

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.020
allowed to have free
charges and currents,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.250
then we can write these things.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.320
So this is what we
just said a minute ago.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.490
Of course, if you've got no
free charges, then div D is 0.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.510
And then if you've got
a material, matter,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.270
without the free charges,
then again, we put the rows

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:37.670
in the J's, 0, and we end up
with these quite nice, simple,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.540
and symmetrical sort
of relationships.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.350
And in any of these
cases, of course,

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.440
you could derive
the wave equation

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.950
and write it in that same
form we had before, OK?

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:59.200
And as we said,
this term here is

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.660
related to the speed of light
in the medium, and what we find

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.510
is that the speed of
light in the medium

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.690
is equal to the speed of
light, your free space,

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.550
divided by the refractive index.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.790
All of those things are
things we've had before.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.970
So I'll just stress again,
one thing that I did

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.890
say earlier, this
was originally,

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.860
if you remember,
curl curl E. And then

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.080
when we got rid of
the curl curl E,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.680
we actually had
to get rid of a--

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.670
what was it-- grad
of div E. And we

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.190
assumed that grad div E is 0.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.650
I'm just reminding
you, again, that is not

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.072
always true, so beware.

00:28:42.072 --> 00:28:44.530
And you probably won't come
across anything in this course,

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.440
but in the general wide
world, it's not always true.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.890
And the second
thing to remember is

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:56.890
that this thing, Del squared of
a vector, that Del squared is

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.770
not equal to the
same as the Laplacian

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.670
except if you're in
Cartesian coordinates.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.760
OK, so now we've got
the wave equation,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.380
we go back just like we
did for scalar waves.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.830
We could look at different
solutions of that wave

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.400
equation, and the
simplest possible one

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.650
is the equation of a plane wave.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.270
And so this is a picture
of what it looks like.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.240
I presume these pictures
are taken from [INAUDIBLE],,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.330
but to me, it seems very
perverse to have the wave

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.920
propagating in the x direction.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.480
He's a bit strange there, but
anyway, virtually every book

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.670
has the wave propagating
in the zed direction.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.420
But nevermind, we
won't worry too much.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.450
It obviously doesn't
make any difference.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:55.140
But this is the important thing,
is we get the electric field

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.146
vector and the
magnetic field vector,

00:29:59.146 --> 00:30:02.770
E and B he's drawing here.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.920
It could equally well be
B and H, because the two--

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.440
the B and H are going to be
proportional to each other,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.790
or at right angles
to each other.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.530
I'm just telling you
the results first.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.390
I haven't proved this yet.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.990
And the wave is
propagating in a direction

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.790
which is at right
angles to both of those.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:27.730
And so these three
form a triad, and it's

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.800
a right-handed triad
such that E cross B is

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.480
in the direction the wave goes.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.980
So that's the way to
always remember it.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.610
Well, that's the
way I remember it,

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.775
is that E cross B is in the
direction the field travels,

00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:46.150
which means, of
course, if you've

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.840
got a right-hand
coordinate system,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.830
normally, we would take
E in the x direction

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.020
and B in the y
direction, and then

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.710
the wave moves in
the zed direction.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:03.130
But he's taken it with E in
the y direction like this,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.320
in order to get it
so that it's still

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.940
a right-handed
coordinate system.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.870
And so how do we get that?

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.600
Well, first of
all, of course, we

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.100
can say it's quite
straightforward for the E.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.870
We can just solve
this thing for the--

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:28.630
just as a-- it's a scalar and
get an expression for E. E

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.800
is going to be then polarized
in a particular direction.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.470
We've then got to work
out how B is polarized

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.790
for this particular
value of E. Well,

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.860
George has said
something here which is--

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.580
I guess it's correct, but
it's quite sort of condensed,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.498
and I went through how I
would really derive it.

00:31:54.498 --> 00:31:56.290
So perhaps, I'll say
a bit more about that.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.330
Well, this first
part is all right.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.410
We've got curl E is minus db dt.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.800
And we know that the
time dependence is this e

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.360
to the minus i omega t.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.750
So ddt of e to the minus i
omega t is very straightforward.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:20.040
That's just-- the minus i
omega comes out the front.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.070
So that's what we get.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:35.520
Curl e is equal to minus db,
dt, is equal to i omega b.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.910
And so we can say then
that b is equal to minus

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.060
i over omega curl e, all right?

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:50.360
So if we know what e is, we can
work out what b is from that.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.730
And so we take e as being
this thing, all right?

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.330
So in general, this
might not be traveling

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.720
in the x direction or any
other particular direction.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.650
It might be just pointing
in some direction in space.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.860
So really, I guess,
you ought to do it

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.620
for that general
case, which means

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.330
that effectively
what you've got to do

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:20.650
is to work out what
curl of the e is.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:26.800
And e is, effectively, as you
can see, a scalar quantity.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.930
Well, let's forget about
the time dependence.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.550
We're only looking
at the space now.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.900
There's this scalar
quantity here.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.010
Time is a constant vector.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:41.200
So we then have to use another
of our identities, which

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.490
is the curl of a
scalar times a vector.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.960
So let's write it like that.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.740
And you might remember that that
is equal to-- and I had to look

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.780
it up because I never
know these things--

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:06.890
5 times curl a plus grad
phi across a, all right?

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.250
So that is a general
vector identity

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.820
which allows you to work out
the curl of this product of two

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.010
things.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.050
And in our case,
this is a plane wave.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.739
So this direction of the
e vector is constant.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.210
So our a is a constant.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.840
So curl of a is going to
be 0 because it's constant.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.400
So that goes.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:39.090
And we're then left with
the curl of phi times a

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.449
is grad phi cross a.

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:49.830
And phi is equal to-- phi
equals e to the i k dot r.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:55.770
And a is equal to this direction
of the e vector, all right?

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.310
So if phi equals e
to the i k dot r,

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:07.570
then grad phi is equal to
ik times e to the i k dot r.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.520
And so we stick that into here.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.260
And after we've done that,
we can derive this expression

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:14.760
here.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.620
We find that finally
the magnetic vector

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.470
is equal to the cross
products of these two.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.600
So that's why, of course,
all these three things

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.740
have to be right angles
to each other, all right?

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.340
So the next thing,
this is a picture of it

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.670
moving along then.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:39.510
And we'll stress, very
strongly, something.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:45.090
And that is that these two, the
electric and magnetic field,

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.680
are in phase with each other.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.060
I don't know what it
is, but I've often

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.780
found that students don't
seem to pick this up.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.180
And they come up with
these funny ideas

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.120
about them being in quadrature.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.070
And I think they get it mixed
up with some other things.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.990
But for a plane polarized
wave, the electric field

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.730
and the magnetic
field, you can see,

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.110
are in phase with each other.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:13.890
When the e is a maximum,
the b is a maximum.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.950
And then they will
have this wave form.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.140
Here this is showing the wave
as a function of distance.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.070
This is like a snapshot of what
happens at a particular time.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.940
But you could equally well get
a very similar sort of thing

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.760
by looking at a
particular position

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.130
and seeing how it
changes with time.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.920
You'd also get sine
waves like this.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.490
And you would also
see that these two,

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.950
the electric and
magnetic fields,

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.670
have to be in phase with each
other for that case, too.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.170
OK?

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.800
This is expressing--
showing you, again,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.090
this right-hand rule
or whatever it is for--

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.040
I don't know how
you do these things.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.320
But anyway, I always like the--

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.120
I can never do these, partly
because I'm left-handed,

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.890
I think.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.520
It ruins things.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.650
But this corkscrew
rule is the one

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.210
that I always know that one.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.160
And my students will
know it's because I'm

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.974
very handy with a corkscrew.

00:37:16.974 --> 00:37:18.890
[LAUGHS]

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:22.970
So this is showing, then, how
this electric field varies

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.360
with space, the fixed time.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.490
And the distance, then,
between these maxima

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.330
in the electric field is
the wavelength, all right?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.270
So this is going to propagate.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.100
It's a traveling wave.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.700
So this structure moves
bodily, doesn't it,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:48.590
in time along this
direction of propagation.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.460
Ah, and now we get
onto this thing

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.550
that I was talking with George
about on the way, the Poynting

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.990
vector.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:05.620
And I don't think you actually
really sort of prove it,

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.940
do you, what it really does.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:13.720
But basically the Poynting
vector, it turns out,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.170
is a measure of the energy flow.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.780
So it's a way of looking
at the energy that's

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.790
carried by a wave.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:25.570
And this is the
definition of it.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.800
So s is equal to 1
over mu 0, e cross b.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.860
Actually, you can see b equals--

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.930
actually, I think this should
really be mu, shouldn't it,

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.550
not mu 0, really, if it
was in a general medium.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.250
And b equals mu h, of course.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.110
So this is really cross h.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:52.780
So that's the way it's sometimes
derived, sometimes defined.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.950
But anyway, but if you're
in free space, then

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.530
you can write it with
mu 0 here like that.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:06.550
And then, using our expression
for the velocity of light,

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.330
then we can write it like this.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:13.570
But I think this is also
true for free space only.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.970
I think that's right.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.440
Presumably this is
from Hecht again.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.520
OK, so this is what
our waves look like.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:30.460
Each of electric and magnetic
fields is a cosine-type wave.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.550
So this represents,
then, a wave which

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:38.520
is moving in this
direction, all right?

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.610
So this thing in here basically
is the phase, isn't it?

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.280
You got cos of a phase term.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.930
So you can see that
as omega t varies,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.940
so the shape of
the wave is going

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.420
to sort of move in a
particular direction.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.880
And you'll notice that--
oh, this is a vector.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.480
This is a vector, but
this is a constant vector.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.600
So this is a vector
which tells you

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.550
the amplitude of that wave
in magnitude and direction.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.190
And you'll notice
that these cosine bits

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.060
are exactly the same.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.850
That's because, as we
said, the e and the b

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.510
are in phase with each other.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.830
And so all that's very simple.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.020
And so what we can say
is that if we represent

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.240
the fields like this,
we can say, according

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.640
to our definition of
the Poynting vector,

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.900
we can write it like this.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:38.020
And so we end up, then, cos
times cos is cos squared.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:45.580
So notice that, although cos
of course can go negative,

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.660
it's periodic, isn't it?

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.830
So it's negative half as
long as it's positive.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.780
Cos squared is always positive.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.610
So the way this is defined,
the Poynting vector

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.320
is always going in
the same direction.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.560
It's always, when
you've got a plane wave,

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.400
the energy is going in the
direction of the direction

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.720
of propagation of the wave.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:20.330
And OK, so this shows
us how we get all this.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.570
Sorry, let me-- this shows us--

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.350
can I go back?

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.350
Aw, yeah.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.830
Oh, I've gone back too far now.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.690
Here we are.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.290
This shows us how this
Poynting vector varies

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.120
in space and time, all right?

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:45.730
So this Poynting vector has also
got a sort of wave-type nature.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.410
But normally what
we're interested in

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.920
is not how it varies
in space and time,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.950
but what the time-averaged form
of that is going to look like.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.280
And so we can do a
time average of it.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.810
And so that's what
this thing here is.

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:12.090
This s with the lines on either
side is the time average of s.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:20.490
And so we've got b is
k times e over omega.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:24.620
And so therefore we've
got here e cross b.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.150
And we know what b is.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.680
So we can put that in.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.086
And we're going to
get now e squared.

00:42:30.086 --> 00:42:32.820
All right, so
finally what we get

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:38.880
is that the Poynting vector
is proportional to the time

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.580
average of the
electric field squared.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.333
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:44.250
COLIN SHEPPARD: Sorry?

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.132
AUDIENCE: Let's
take the average.

00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:46.455
We haven't done the average.

00:42:46.455 --> 00:42:48.622
COLIN SHEPPARD: Oh, we
haven't done any average yet.

00:42:48.622 --> 00:42:49.950
Sorry, but this is the modulus.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.450
So--

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.170
AUDIENCE: Anyway [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.298
COLIN SHEPPARD: It's the--

00:42:53.298 --> 00:42:54.630
AUDIENCE: So right now--

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.440
COLIN SHEPPARD: What
do the two lines mean?

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.946
AUDIENCE: The magnitude
of the vector.

00:42:58.946 --> 00:43:01.154
COLIN SHEPPARD: OK, it's
the magnitude of the vector.

00:43:01.154 --> 00:43:02.363
AUDIENCE: A function of time.

00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:04.470
COLIN SHEPPARD: It's
still a function of time.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.800
OK, we'll take it as that, yeah.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.980
And yeah, OK.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.620
And I think, really,
if it's in a medium,

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.400
this is epsilon, not epsilon 0.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.010
Is that right?

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.507
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:22.507 --> 00:43:23.382
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.830
OK, so now we're going
to do the time averaging.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.880
So this e, e is a
time-varying quantity.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.140
e varies with both
space and time.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:45.870
And so this is the modular
square of it, of the vector.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.940
So we put that in.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.655
And we get, then, the s is equal
to something we cos squared.

00:43:53.655 --> 00:43:55.780
So it's not much different
from what we had before.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.760
OK, and then the next thing we
do is to do the time averaging.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:10.770
So this is something which
is positive but oscillating,

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.270
time-varying.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.480
And the speed of these
variations is very, very fast.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.600
We've said before the
frequency of light is around 10

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.300
to the 15 Hertz, which is
faster than any detector

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.640
that we have to measure the
fields directly, all right?

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.990
So you can't actually
measure the electric field

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:39.930
or the power of an optical
wave because the frequency's

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.580
so high.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:48.120
So a normal detector, like
a photo diode or whatever,

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.180
would be measuring some
time average of this

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.920
because there's no
way it can respond

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.150
to this sort of frequency.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.440
So we do the time average.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.590
And so this is how we can
do the time average, right?

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:06.600
The square things mean time
average, the caret signs.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.040
And the time average, you
integrate this over a long time

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.440
and divide by the time
to get the time average.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.140
And so this is called--

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.070
well, usually called intensity.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:27.110
I think that "intensity" is
now frowned upon by purists.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:31.220
And they come up with new
names every now and then.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:36.770
So "irradiance" is a word
that you often read nowadays

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.460
in the literature.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.970
And yeah, so here
it's measured in watts

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:47.240
per square meter, which is
obviously a unit of power

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.700
density, all right?

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.130
There's one other thing
that's worth mentioning here.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:57.200
And that is actually that
normal detectors actually really

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.250
don't measure the
Poynting vector.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:04.880
They actually usually measure
the electric energy density.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.830
And there's a thing called
Poynting's theorem, which,

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.080
if you study
electromagnetism, will

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.490
show that the power
flow out of a volume

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.090
is equal to the rate of
change of the stored energy.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.770
And the stored
energy is made up of

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.330
electric and magnetic energy.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.760
So all these things are related.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.100
And it turns out that for all
practical purposes normally

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.270
it doesn't really matter whether
you're measuring the Poynting

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:40.700
vector or the electric
energy density or whatever.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.160
It's going to give the
same sort of answer.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.100
But there are cases where
you have to be careful.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.850
OK, and then finally we've got
to do this time average of cos

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.450
squared.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:00.270
And the time average of
cos squared is just a half.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.660
You remember how you do that?

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.900
Cos squared, you go
into double angles.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.300
And then you get a
cosine that cancels out.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.760
And you're just left
with the constant bit.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.970
And then, finally then,
you put that half in.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.090
And we've now got an
expression for the intensity,

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:23.100
defined as being the time
average of the Poynting vector

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:30.080
as being equal to the amplitude
of the electric field squared,

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.520
multiplied by some
constant, which,

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.680
in probably 99 cases out
of 100, we don't even

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.840
bother to even think
what that constant

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.390
is, let alone thinking of
whether there's a half there.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.890
So you'll see loads
of books or papers

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.840
where they just say
that the intensity is

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.420
equal to e squared, which is
strictly not true, I guess,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.650
but people do say.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.400
So how are we going?

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.570
We got one hour, yeah.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:11.490
OK, so that's how you
can calculate the power

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:16.060
flow for a plane wave.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.470
I guess the method
is not only going

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:19.760
to be true for plane waves.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.350
But you can apply it for
other sorts of waves, too.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.220
But the next thing is you
might think back to what

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.380
we were doing with phases.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.330
And there are a
few things that are

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:34.030
important to realize
here, what you can do

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.280
and what you can't do.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.470
You remember this is what
we said from our phases.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:44.990
We said that what we actually
measure in the real world

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.730
is a wave that's like this.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:52.030
It's a cosine dependence
in space and time.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:57.250
And we say that we use
this complex representative

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:00.460
where we say that
this is the real part

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.940
of some complex exponential.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.370
And if you remember, the
reason for doing that

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.560
is that these
complex exponentials

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.770
are much easier to manipulate.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.160
It means that you don't have to
remember all those horrible cos

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.900
of a plus b things and so on.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:23.220
So it's much easier to do
the algebra using these.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.100
So what you do normally,
as you remember,

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:32.700
is you do all your algebra
with each of the i-somethings.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.910
And then right at the
very end normally,

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.420
you find the real
part to find what

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:45.060
the real field is in real
space, as we're used to.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.990
But here, now you've got to
be very careful because you

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:53.480
saw that the Poynting vector
actually was cos squared,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.120
all right?

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.450
So this is a nonlinear.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:01.170
We performed a
nonlinear operation.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.050
And if you do
nonlinear operations,

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.300
the same would be true
for nonlinear optics,

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.350
as well, actually.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:11.310
You can't do it in
this complex notation

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.830
directly because you just
get the wrong answer.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:20.400
If you squared this, you get
an e to the 2i kz minus 5,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.010
wouldn't you?

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.980
Now the real part of
that is not what we want.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:35.600
So what you've really got to do
is to work through, I guess--

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.120
well, the surest way of doing
it is to work through in terms

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:46.440
of the cosines and so on rather
than to go into e to the i's.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.600
So this is saying a
bit more about this.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:56.010
So what we've got, then, is this
is showing how you can do it

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.530
in terms of the cosines.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:02.460
So you can see that,
for example, here we've

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.090
got two fields.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.870
And let's say that
you see the point is

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:11.450
that, although the
fields are additive,

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:18.700
the power of those
two waves is not

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.400
going to be equal to the sum
of the powers of the two waves,

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.120
all right?

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:28.000
So we can say that the
e's would add coherently.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.160
And then we can work
out the power flow

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.530
of the sum of these two fields.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:35.190
And you can see of course,
expanding this square,

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.750
you're going to have
the power of the two.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:42.610
But you're also going
to get this cross term,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.280
the cross product
term, which depends--

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.390
you can see here--

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:48.730
on the relative phase
of the two waves.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.830
If they're out of
phase by 90 degrees,

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.000
then that will go to 0.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.020
But if they're in phase, this
of course is going to be strong.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:04.720
And so that's one
way of doing it.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.630
But in terms of
phases, then, you

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.280
can do it in terms of phases.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.170
I'm just saying you have to
be careful how you do it.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:19.610
And so you have to add the
phases first and then find

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.380
the modulus square.

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:25.130
You can't actually
do the squaring

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.810
and then do the real
power, all right?

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.330
So you add these
two phases together,

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:33.110
which gives the total field.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:36.650
And then the intensity
is going to be

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.350
the modulus square of this.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:39.500
And you expand it.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.860
And you can see we've got
exactly the same answer.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.190
So it doesn't matter
which way you do it,

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:48.470
as long as you do it
one of those ways.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.340
What you don't want to do is
to try squaring the e-to-the-i

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.670
things and then taking the
real power because you'll get

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.700
something different then.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.700
And that is the very last slide.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.250
And that is dead on time.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.300
So, well, whoa,
we've got a couple

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.550
of minutes for some questions.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:11.850
So any questions?

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.460
Yes, Sharon?

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.340
Hello?

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.820
I'm quite curious about
the Poynting vector.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.200
And you mentioned that
it's actually a cross term,

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.880
and it's similar like
propagation and direction,

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.640
like where the energy flows.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.900
But what about the peculiar
case in evanescent waves?

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.042
Does it mean the energy
is not propagating there?

00:53:36.042 --> 00:53:37.250
COLIN SHEPPARD: Oh, oh, dear.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:38.510
Oh, yes.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.810
Evanescent waves, you're
getting onto something

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:42.880
really controversial--

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.640
AUDIENCE: No, I'm thinking--

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.960
COLIN SHEPPARD:
--here, I think--

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.470
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:46.040
COLIN SHEPPARD: --actually.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.852
AUDIENCE: Well, where
has the energy gone then?

00:53:47.852 --> 00:53:48.769
COLIN SHEPPARD: Sorry?

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:50.810
AUDIENCE: I mean, if
the Poynting vector is

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.880
the direction of
the energy flow,

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.830
then it seems like there's
no propagation in energy

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.935
in the evanescent wave then--

00:53:57.935 --> 00:53:59.450
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Well, it is normally

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.310
said that there is
no energy propagation

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.490
in an evanescent wave.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:06.790
But you know, in
a way, there is.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:10.280
There's sort of transverse
propagation of energy.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.420
But there's no
energy flow across--

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.390
if you're doing total
internal reflection

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.460
and you're looking
at the steady state,

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:22.310
there's no energy flow
across the boundary,

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.300
I think is true to say.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.350
Is that true, or--

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:28.100
yeah, this is--

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:28.340
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.673
COLIN SHEPPARD: --getting a
bit controversial, isn't it?

00:54:30.673 --> 00:54:32.650
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, you can--

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:33.950
if you have the interface--

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.700
I don't know if anyone
can see, but if you

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.740
have the interface of the TAR,
if you compute the Poynting

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.800
vector in the vertical
direction, those have to be 0.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.140
The time average is 0.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:44.360
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.610
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
you don't have energy flow.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.440
But you do have energy density.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.160
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.690
And the other
thing is, you know,

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:56.060
the question of if
you've got-- and this is

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.600
your total internal reflection.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.230
So here you get this
evanescent wave.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:04.130
Now, of course,
all these questions

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:08.210
of these evanescent
waves and so on, they all

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:13.760
rely on assuming infinite plane
waves and infinite surfaces

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.180
and things like that, which
of course none of these things

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.670
can really be strictly
true in practice.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.690
But if we do this,
then we'd expect

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.340
to get something
which is actually

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.420
traveling in this direction.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.820
And so in some sense,
I think that there

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:36.660
is some sort of energy flow
in the transverse direction.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.460
But I'm just having a big
argument about this, not

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.090
for this case, but to do
with some other project

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.360
we're doing at the
moment where it's

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.130
to do with when
the h vector is 0.

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:56.097
And so the question is,
is there energy flow?

00:55:56.097 --> 00:55:57.180
Well, I guess there isn't.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.380
But I think there's
also this question

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:06.860
of whether Poynting vector
really always means the energy

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.470
flow.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.200
In fact, I remember having a
conversation with Emil Wolf

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.240
once about this.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.170
And, well, he said, let
me give you an example.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:25.520
Imagine you have a DC
planar electric field

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:31.040
in this direction, and you
have a DC planar magnetic field

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.720
in this direction.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.580
Is there any energy flow?

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.320
No.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.380
But you can work out
what e cross h is.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:44.510
And you know, so I think
that he put this forward

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:51.800
as an example which makes you
wonder whether it necessarily

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.110
really always means energy flow.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.820
We were talking
about this in the lab

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.730
today because
people have come up

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:04.520
with these solutions where, for
example, energy flow sometimes

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.340
does this.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:10.030
So you might get the lines of--

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.140
the Poynting vector might
do something like this.

00:57:18.513 --> 00:57:19.930
So here you can
see that there has

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:24.920
to be some sort of 0 around here
because this is going this way,

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.020
and this is going this way.

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:30.730
And here you can actually
get these, sort of,

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:36.730
closed eddies of Poynting vector
that's going round in circles.

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.430
Now, whether this
really represents

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:42.370
something that's physical
or not, I don't really know.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.920
You know, in water flow, I
guess you could get this.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.410
There's no reason why
you couldn't get eddies

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.840
of water going in circles.

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.080
But you know, so
this is what you get.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.800
This is what you
get if you've just

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.450
got a very simple example of
a lens focusing the light.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:06.530
You get this sort of pattern if
I look at this in some detail.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:11.760
You get this sort of
behavior in this region here.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.090
And there've been papers
that have described this.

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:18.180
But what it really
means in practice--

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:24.000
well, I guess nothing
really means anything

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.770
unless you can measure it.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.420
So the question
is, can you come up

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.630
with a detector that
measures Poynting vector?

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.130
And I don't know
the answer to that.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.810
As I said earlier, I think
normally detectors measure

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.670
electric energy density.

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:42.510
So people have looked at
what happens in this focused

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:43.920
region of a lens.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.160
And there are various
ways you can look at that.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.290
People have used
near-field optics,

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.190
you know, a tapered
fiber to look at it.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:58.290
Or you can do some sort of
tomography-type experiments

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.860
with a detector that you
rotate and things like that.

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:07.820
But to actually measure the
Poynting vector, I don't know.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.500
Right, any questions
from over there?

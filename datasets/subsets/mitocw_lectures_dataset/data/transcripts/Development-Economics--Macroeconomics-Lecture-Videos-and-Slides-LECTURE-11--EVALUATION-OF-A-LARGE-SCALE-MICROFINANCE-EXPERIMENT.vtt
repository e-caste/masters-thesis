00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.860
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So this is
about evaluating microcredit.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.220
And how to do it.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.230
It's also a methods
lecture in some sense,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.120
because it's going to
be an application where

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.990
it was done both as
reduced form, IV, as well

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.640
as structural.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.890
So that gives us this
great opportunity

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
to think about pros and cons,
pluses and minuses, kind

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.360
of what you can get from
one and not from the other.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.580
And this is about a
financial intervention.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.790
So we have been consistent
in every single lecture

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.350
in talking about
financial constraints

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.500
and financial modeling and
talking about policy and policy

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.810
implications of changing
the financial system.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.190
So this is an illustrative
to application

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.440
of that general theme.

00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:44.890
Very little review
of the literature,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.890
but there are two, three
applications-- actually

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.360
the truth is there is very few
RCT evaluations of microcredit.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.490
Abhijit, Esther,
Cynthia, and Rachel

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.880
did one in Hyderabad, Spandana.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.610
And in many ways,
the results are

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.290
strikingly similar
to what we're going

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.565
to find in the Thai villages
and even some similarity

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:17.065
to Morocco.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.500
What I want to emphasize,
and they do too,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.600
is the heterogeneity.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.350
So, for example, in
Hyderabad, there's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.100
group-based lending,
joint liability.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.130
They're small loans,
female borrowers,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.400
subsidized low rates.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.240
On average, to be
put in italics,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.100
there's no impact on
total expenditures.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.930
But on average an increase
in durables in the short run.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.390
And you might stop there,
and that would be a mistake,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.190
because the really
interesting stuff

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.520
gets going when you start
looking at the people who

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.460
are running or might run
businesses, business creation,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.010
business assets, self-employed
hours and profits increase

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.580
for those who already
had existing businesses.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.480
Their durable
consumption goes up.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.430
Non-durable does not.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.790
Now, the consumption part
is similar to the aggregate.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.590
But if you look,
at say, the those

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.770
who have as in a probit,
a high propensity

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.450
to start new businesses
in the sample,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.460
they increase their
durable goods spending.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.150
But they decrease their
non-durable goods spending.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.580
So you are seeing something
constant on the average

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.180
and going down for one group.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.710
And in fact, if you look at
the flip side, which is not

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.530
surprising given the
average is what it is,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.420
the low propensity
business owners

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.040
actually increase their
consumption of non-durables.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.160
So various heterogeneous
impact based, by the way,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.589
on observables, namely
current business owners,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.510
and unobservables
that are backed out

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.090
through these propensity
scores, as in probits.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.720
So it's unobservable as well
as observable heterogeneity

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.860
that seems to matter.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.320
Morocco similar, larger
loans, lending to men.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.920
No effects on consumption.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.240
Maybe some small reduction in
consumption for those doing

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.340
agriculture and livestock.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.340
No effect on business creation,
but within existing businesses,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.570
certain activities were
discontinued less often,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.700
and the scale of
other activities,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.860
as in agriculture and
livestock, increase.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.400
So again, another aspect,
one, the consumption aspect

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.390
is kind of similar in the sense
that maybe for these guys that

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.450
seem to have some
business impact,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.200
consumption might be
going down instead

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.120
of on average staying constant.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.900
And then you have this kind of
nebulous effect on businesses.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.260
A lot of people
think of microcredit

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.590
traditionally as an impetus
to business creation.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.920
It's to allow talented,
if poor, people

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.400
to enter and expand and
also enter into business.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.090
And, in fact, some of the early
micro founded macro models

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.520
that we went through in
class very much feature

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.550
that vehicle--

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.480
people going into business
who couldn't previously,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.652
as their wealth expanded, you
know, driving aggregate TFP.

00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:09.770
Now, that's not to say
those studies were wrong.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.750
These things can vary
across countries.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.240
And they can vary
within a given country,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.220
according to kind of the
state of the financial system.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.830
And the overall
development path.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.220
But we'll see, again, in
the Thai study, this a bit

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.930
of a struggle to
figure out what's

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.410
going on within existing
businesses that's allowing them

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.780
to be more profitable.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.850
And that durable goods
things, you know, again,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.920
as we've studied in
the financial accounts,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.030
we make decisions
about classification.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.880
But some durable goods are
used not just as a service flow

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.180
for household consumption,
but also potentially

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.420
used in the business.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.320
And if there are sort
of increase in durables

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.960
might suggest, they're
actually expanding

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.980
the business in some way,
not just taking it out

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.905
in terms of increased
consumption.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.990
So in Thailand, it's
the Million Baht Fund.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.100
It was a government
intervention.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.155
It was not a randomized
control trial.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.435
And I guess I'll deal
with that right away.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.050
How are we doing an
evaluation as if it were

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.490
a randomized control trial?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.200
Well, it was basically a
million baht per village.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.280
Villages are well-defined
geopolitical entities.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.670
But they vary in terms
of total population size.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.000
So all villages got the
same amount of credit.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.800
The villages with
fewer households

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.230
got a higher per
capita treatment.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.830
And there were 72,000 villages,
by the way, in Thailand.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.050
And they all got something in
the order of $24,000, $25,000.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.070
So this was approximately
1.5% percent of GDP.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.190
So you could easily claim it's
the world's largest microcredit

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.040
sort of expansion
and evaluation.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.310
Now, it's a
quasi-experimental design.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.760
You'll see in the slides,
but I'll say it now,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.720
you know, we carefully look
at pre-intervention trends

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.510
to see whether there's anything
else going on systematically

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.360
in a comparison between
small and large villages.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.280
And we can't find much.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.400
We've even gotten the maps
out and used this community

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.570
development department data for
all the villages in Thailand

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.460
and looked at village size to
see if, for example, larger

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.440
villages are near urban areas or
nearer to main roads and so on.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.820
They're not.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:05.160
We only find one or two
variables that are correlated.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.340
And you kind of expect
if you're searching

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.400
over hundreds of variables to
find a few things now and then.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.470
So we're going to look
at the effect of credit

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.340
on consumption,
investment, income.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.200
And we're also going to look
at some general equilibrium

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.700
effects.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:36.430
And again, just for worry that
I'll forget to say it later,

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.760
if you view villages as
small open economies--

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.270
and we have seen
papers on that--

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.870
then by intervening
village by village,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.250
there's some sense in which
you're intervening country

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.840
by country.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.250
That's pretty rare opportunity.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.280
These models we've
been dealing with

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.270
take a stand on what might
happen with wages, for example,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.820
in general equilibrium.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.580
So we can actually see if
there's a wage effect going on

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.680
over and above the
potential benefits

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.240
or other impacts on
households who got credit.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.110
Households who don't
even get credit,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.140
but live in a village where
business might be expanding

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.120
would be villages given certain
obstacles to total migration,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.510
would be villages where
the wages are going up.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.440
And again, that's what we saw
in those first few lectures

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.080
to be the impact
of the expansion

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.730
of the financial system.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:38.590
Question?

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.680
AUDIENCE: So I guess, ex
ante, did it surprise you

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.955
that there was no
correlation between things

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:51.570
like village size and proximity
to resources or productivity

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.530
of the average business
in the village or--

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.960
ROBERT TOWNSEND: One thing,
it's a political decision.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.650
And they divide and
subdivide villages.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.770
But they don't do it on a
regular, persistent basis.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.950
So if a village were
getting bigger and bigger

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.680
for economic reasons,
then it could

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.720
get divided by the government
into two separate villages.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.960
AUDIENCE: So what is the
measure that you looked down?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.363
The one decided
by the government?

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:21.280
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.970
At a moment in time,
we have the identity

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.190
of each of the villages.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.890
And we count the number of
households in the village.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.410
AUDIENCE: So
potentially something

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.390
that we count as two villages
is actually one big village?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.320
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
so the real question

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.330
is whether the funds
could have leaked over

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.360
to neighboring villages.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.380
The grant that established
this village-level institution

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.200
was for a village.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.640
You know, like Downtown
Crossing gets a village fund.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.320
Beacon Hill doesn't get one.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.262
Sorry, close to home.

00:11:58.262 --> 00:12:01.102
AUDIENCE: There's huge
incentive not share it, right?

00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:02.560
I mean, it belongs
to your village.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.935
Why would you want
someone else--

00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.265
AUDIENCE: No, no,
what I mugging,

00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:09.310
is I think sort of agricultural
or resource economics

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.230
suggests that
village size should

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.560
be endogenous to
resources in an area.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.990
Like there should
be more villages

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.140
near freshwater source,
like in, you know,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.950
maybe a thousand years
ago or something.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, but
then adjust for population.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.200
Actually, I think your
argument goes the other way.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.700
AUDIENCE: OK, sure, I mean--

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.470
ROBERT TOWNSEND: If villages
are an arbitrary collection

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.600
of people, then you might
want to have the same number

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.433
in each one of them.

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:34.330
There could be more villages.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.960
But potentially there are same
number of people per village

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.200
if the government has
some systematic rule.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.800
Now, the government is
messing around, but not as

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.540
systematically.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.710
That's one comment.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.870
The other thing is this leaking,
because if I could get credit

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.330
from some other village
and/or, as we've

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.270
seen with the informal
kinship networks,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.030
get more money from
someone else who is

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.160
connected to another
village, then

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.470
we wouldn't have any power.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.880
Now, we have looked at that too.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.080
And again, we've done the GIS.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.550
We've gotten all the
maps out and looked

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.000
at the impact on
villages nearby,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.930
creating these sort of
smooth neighborhood averages.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:26.740
And at least early on, the
impact doesn't spill over.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.600
But that doesn't say in the
long run it might spill over,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.150
which is another interesting
potential thing to do.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.650
Yeah?

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.510
AUDIENCE: I have a
question that's similar--

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.136
how essentially villages
could be subdivided cities,

00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:42.876
how you can consider
them small--

00:13:42.876 --> 00:13:44.626
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
have I answered it?

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:45.376
AUDIENCE: I think.

00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:46.209
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:13:46.209 --> 00:13:48.180
AUDIENCE: Well, I still
don't get why you can,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.710
but if empirically it looks
like there aren't spillover.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.580
I guess that's somewhat
of a justification.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I accept
what you're saying is true.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.380
But it confuses me from
like a priori point of view

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.130
why is that just--

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.803
it seams--

00:14:03.803 --> 00:14:05.970
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, we
didn't take it for granted

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.070
and get 3/4 of the
way through the study

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.070
and then think about it.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:09.780
AUDIENCE: No, no, I know--

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.400
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We
looked right away,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.270
and I would have thought--

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:12.810
AUDIENCE: I can tell from--

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.790
ROBERT TOWNSEND: My
hunch was larger villages

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.507
would be near the cities
and the main roads.

00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:20.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it might
have a higher average TFP

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.420
or something.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: There's
a map in the paper.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.780
And, you know, I'd
created these slides kind

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.140
of too late to include it.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.140
But you'll be
reassured by the map.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.470
AUDIENCE: No, I believe you.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.428
I am just confused by--

00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:33.210
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You can
rub your hands on it and--

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.980
AUDIENCE: Some sort
of that's true.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.220
But it's not true, like
you have some sort of hubs

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:44.350
all scattered around, so
like the size, you know--

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.420
AUDIENCE: So the one thing is
that if it's really urbanized--

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.660
so there's a limit.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.630
Once you reach a
certain population,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.520
so this takes care of
some of the heterogeneity.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.640
Once the population
reaches a certain size,

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.555
like the government will just
designate it a town instead,

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:00.755
so it won't be a village.

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:01.860
AUDIENCE: Sure, that would
take care of some of it.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.540
But it shouldn't take
care of all of it.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.450
There should still be some
variation in the boundary.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.435
Well, one would there
would be variation.

00:15:07.435 --> 00:15:09.018
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It
would be depend on

00:15:09.018 --> 00:15:12.050
how quickly they subdivide
them and so on and so forth.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.050
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.216
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We just looked
empirically and got reassured.

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.590
Yes.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.750
AUDIENCE: A related question is
sort of who has the incentives

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.970
to subdivide up a village?

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.460
Like have there been other
sort of village-level programs

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.278
in the past which--

00:15:28.278 --> 00:15:29.820
I'm not sure would
got the incentive.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.050
But if predicted something
like Million Baht Village

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.630
was coming, you'd want to
subdivide your village.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, so on that,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.810
the program was announced
pretty suddenly and implemented.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.620
Thaksin ran on this and
implemented it very quickly

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.790
after being elected.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.880
So arguably it couldn't
have been anticipated.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.540
Now, you know, the
larger question is,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.970
why was if he was
trying to maximize

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.650
votes you'd want it per capita?

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.640
Why give a lot of money
to a village where

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.890
there aren't very many people?

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.880
But, again, in the
Thai system, villages

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.290
are thought of as part of the
political system it's village,

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.160
tambon, amphoe, and so on.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.200
So you give it to a
committee within the village

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.500
to run a fund.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.130
And somehow it
seemed, quote, "fair."

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.450
It's great for us, right?

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:32.380
I mean, there's wonderful
mistakes in some respect.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.610
It's kind of a
unique opportunity.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.530
So we did that.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.400
Oops, I see.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.900
OK.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.700
So as I said, it's
part of the GDP.

00:16:56.946 --> 00:17:00.773
AUDIENCE: What is the 77,000?

00:17:00.773 --> 00:17:02.690
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
I think that's supposed

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.200
to be villages, not households.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.770
That's too low.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.910
This I've said.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.460
So if you don't mine,
I'll just skip it.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.099
Loans are about
$500, short-term,

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.359
as in one year,
typically two guarantors.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:26.530
The interest rate was higher
initially at about 7%,

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.130
although the village committees
vote on those things.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.550
And they allowed loans for both
consumption and investment,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.190
unlike the stereotypical
program where

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.820
somehow consumption smoothing
is supposed to be a bad thing.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.380
So it's my data.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.330
But in this context,
probably bears

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.990
repeating because it's
unusual that we didn't

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.530
see this program coming either.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.910
We're out there gathering
data year after year.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.772
And we have five years of
the pre-intervention data.

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:04.980
We're going to exploit that
like crazy, because we're

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.380
going to write down a model,
which I'll tell you about,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.980
and estimate it, all based
on the pre-intervention data,

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.750
and then simulate
the model in compared

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.600
to what actually happened.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.260
We actually have six years
of post-program data too,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.680
which is, again, rare, and
here, quite interesting.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.530
Again, if you're thinking
about, which you may not,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.460
but you might be thinking about
budget constraints to do RCTs

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.090
and so on.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.310
It's quite expensive.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.910
And gathering the data is
a big part of the expense.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.050
So running a survey for a long
time before the intervention

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.270
and running it for a
long time afterwards

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.240
is almost prohibitively
expensive.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.090
Or at least you wouldn't be able
to evaluate very many things.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.670
But we didn't design
the data gathering

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.720
with this thing in mind.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.810
It just happened.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.150
I guess in that sense,
again, we just got lucky.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.070
We're going to look at
four kinds of outcomes,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.900
short-term credit,
overall, I might add,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.110
not just from the village
funds, including, therefore,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:20.520
borrowing from the BAC, the
Ag Bank, commercial banks,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.490
the reasons for borrowing--

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.650
although I don't have
those slides for you

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.430
here because money's
potentially fungible.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.970
We do look at interest
rates default and so on.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.900
We have consumption broken
down in these annual data,

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:43.180
by the way, into
these categories.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.640
Why these categories?

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.860
Well, we had the
socioeconomic survey.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.060
And we did analysis when
we designed my survey

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.460
to see what subset
of consumption items

00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.700
would best predict the total
in the socioeconomic survey.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.470
So that's kind of in the spirit
of Blundell and Pistaferri

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.990
and so on in terms of taking
advantage, projecting to get

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.305
something bigger than food.

00:20:13.305 --> 00:20:15.680
But actually there's some
interesting stuff with alcohol.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.920
I'll show you, if
I remember, when

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.420
we get through these things.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.960
Income and production decisions
is another class of categories.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.090
We have assets and
income growth, even

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:30.940
in the annual data, divided
into business, wage and salary,

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.150
and agriculture and so on.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.970
And we see revenues
and expenses.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.410
And again, we have
some ability to look

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.040
at female headed as opposed
to male headed households.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.330
OK, what's an outcome?

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.130
y for household n at date t.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:06.260
This is like imagine running,
oh, my god, a simple-minded OLS

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:12.140
regression, the way people
sometimes used to do.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.510
So Village Fund credit would
include the Million Baht Fund.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.960
You want to see the impact
causally on an outcome.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.710
Of course, we're going
to instrument this.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:33.740
But the other things are these
household characteristics,

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.650
of various kinds, mainly
demographics, age, education,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.910
number of kids, blah,
blah, blah, gender.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.600
And then we have a time fixed
effects and a household fixed

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.660
effects, which are
estimated in the data.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:01.370
And here's the endogenous
variable being instrumented.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.490
And this is pretty simple.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:08.550
And we also have those x
covariates here and time

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:14.550
and household fixed effects for
household short-term credit,

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.450
household and at date t.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.360
But we've also got
some dummies that

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.447
kick in the first
year and second year

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:24.280
of the intervention.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.370
Those are chis not x's.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.410
Those are 0, 1 variables.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.940
And they're interacted with the
inverse number of households.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.270
So inverse, that's just
to get the sign right.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:45.960
Although it's a parabola, so
it's not exactly not mattering.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.660
But if you wanted this
thing to be positive,

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.500
the larger the
number of households,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.230
the smaller this number,
and kind of the less

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.900
you would expect
the impact to be.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.880
And then we have the usual all
the errors are uncorrelated

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.680
with each other, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.370
Yep.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.040
AUDIENCE: How many
villages was this?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.610
ROBERT TOWNSEND: This is 64,
because it's my annual data.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:22.232
AUDIENCE: And can you also look
at outcomes in the CDD data?

00:23:22.232 --> 00:23:27.160
You know, 450,000?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:34.173
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We have
not amazingly done that.

00:23:34.173 --> 00:23:36.662
AUDIENCE: CDD is at
the village level.

00:23:36.662 --> 00:23:38.922
This a regression at
the household level.

00:23:38.922 --> 00:23:40.280
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: But
you could potentially

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.190
do things across villages to
see where the villages got

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.430
more or less credit.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.450
So the spirit of it is possible.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.920
Someone actually looked at
the socioeconomic survey

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.040
and had enough connections
to the Nash NSO

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.940
to get it by village.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.780
But their timing was off,
because their first year is

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.370
the year of the intervention.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.670
And we have the
pre-intervention data.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.080
But anyway, it's possible.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.310
No one has looked at that.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.327
AUDIENCE: What was year
of the intervention?

00:24:16.327 --> 00:24:17.660
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The first year?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.013
ROBERT TOWNSEND: 2002.

00:24:23.013 --> 00:24:25.090
AUDIENCE: Why don't
they have the ISS data?

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.382
They just don't have the years?

00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:28.590
I thought the ISS
go back 30 years.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.310
ROBERT TOWNSEND: They
don't have a panel.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.340
But they don't have
panel afterward?

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.920
ROBERT TOWNSEND: They do.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.820
They did.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.320
Yeah.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.612
AUDIENCE: But we don't have it.

00:24:38.612 --> 00:24:42.050
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We
discovered it after.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:42.580
We have it.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.100
So we're going to look at new
short-term credit, consumption,

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.270
asset growth, and income.

00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:57.650
Tried to do it pretty carefully.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.470
We actually did it about
four more ways than this.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.130
But reduced the number
of that we show.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.410
OLS with all the problems
that you know about.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:12.790
Here's an IV regression with all
villages as opposed to fifth--

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.610
this is kind of
outliers in village.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.030
If you think about
that parabola,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.300
you know, it's kind of getting
really steep when household

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.560
size is really small--

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.500
number of households is
small and not moving much.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:30.890
So we clipped off,
took the big chunk,

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.770
but we clipped off the tails
of small and large villages

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.030
and dropped some outliers
from the household data too.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:46.010
But every single way we do it,
short-term village fund credit

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.010
goes new, new, short-term
village credit goes up.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:57.440
These are roughly the order of
magnitude of $25,000 divided

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.310
by the number of households.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.990
So, you know, credit goes up.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.060
You might be worried.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.270
And like Esther and Abhijit
have papers where there's

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.790
this substitution going on.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.540
You get cheap credit
from one source.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.130
You borrow less
from other sources.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.170
That doesn't happen.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:20.110
In fact, arguably there seems to
be almost an amplifier effect,

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.570
but more weakly.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.480
Short-term credit goes
up, for sure, one to one.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.830
And you can see it in the data.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.750
I mean, this is this like a huge
spike in the financial system.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.420
And it didn't go down.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.610
That part doesn't go
down subsequently.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.133
Yep.

00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:39.050
AUDIENCE: If we thought
that going up variable

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.380
was-- took that seriously, could
that be something like people

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.450
getting extra funds
and re-lending

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.438
and so you have to
sort of multiplier?

00:26:47.438 --> 00:26:48.730
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It's true one.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.830
Would have to--
that's a good point.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.570
Once could be just--

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.164
not to say that
it's a bad thing.

00:26:57.164 --> 00:26:59.600
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.140
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
But, you know, you

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.350
have these sort of combinations
of characteristics of loans.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.480
And if the village
fund committee

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.040
has this cap, which
they're supposed

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.680
to have on the
loan size, then you

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.350
get one leg up and think
about doing something.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.500
Maybe you want to go the
money lender or other sources

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.065
and lever up even more
when you have chunkiness.

00:27:23.065 --> 00:27:24.690
AUDIENCE: So this is
because it's going

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.050
more one to one, the credit?

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.990
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.580
But the more conservative way
to read it is just one for one

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.090
anyway.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.450
So it's not like a substitute
for other sources of money.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.130
AUDIENCE: So when
I initially looked

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.680
at it I thought this support
for Esther and Abhijit's idea

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.510
that if you can get
over a hump, then

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.260
you'll really want to
expand or something.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.177
But I think what you
were saying is could they

00:27:50.177 --> 00:27:52.190
be re-lending to each other?

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.110
So I could I be--

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.980
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, he did say that.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.598
And, yeah, that
could be going on.

00:27:55.598 --> 00:27:56.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.843
That's a convenient explanation.

00:27:57.843 --> 00:27:59.260
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
And I don't think

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.520
we tried to take that out.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.780
We're just looking
at the household

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.860
and at date t in some
village j and adding up

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.690
all the short-term
loans that they have.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.130
So if you only counted the
loan and not the lending,

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.800
if it wasn't net, and
I think it wasn't.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.333
I think it's just gross.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.250
AUDIENCE: Not all
loans are one year.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.750
They're are loans
that are one week.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.792
AUDIENCE: No, sure, yeah.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.440
AUDIENCE: They almost have
different lending, really,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.297
really short term.

00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:35.630
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So that's
why we did short term instead

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.800
of long term.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.250
Consumption levels,
other than the OLS--

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.150
I'll come back to that-- go up.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:48.455
Significantly, asset growth in
one specification goes down.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:58.940
Now, I can't help it
but say that we're going

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.023
to have to choose a model.

00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:01.107
What I'm going to do now--

00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:02.710
I'm giving you these
stylized facts--

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:09.730
but what model comes to your
head on why things like savings

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.540
might go down?

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.260
Like a buffer stock model.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.840
If you're on your
own, you're saving

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.450
for these future disasters.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.970
Now, in the future,
you could borrow

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.120
if you believe the village
fund is persistent.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.130
So you don't need to have
so many buffer stocks.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.675
So net financial savings
goes down actually.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.370
And we have trouble finding
stuff with the capital stock.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.460
I'll mention that.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.430
By the way, these
consumption magnitudes

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.310
are very similar to
the credit magnitudes.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.210
So a bit naively,
you might say they

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.490
used it all for consumption.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.540
Now, again, what
model do we have

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.460
that would predict
that consumption

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.220
ought to go up one for one
with an increase in credit?

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.660
AUDIENCE: Life time
permanent income model.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.860
ROBERT TOWNSEND: What
would the permanent income

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.520
model give you?

00:30:16.557 --> 00:30:18.140
AUDIENCE: It would
go up, wouldn't it?

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.710
ROBERT TOWNSEND: How much?

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.379
AUDIENCE: It has hazard shock
is temporary or persistent.

00:30:23.379 --> 00:30:25.421
AUDIENCE: You would think
this persistent, right?

00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.320
So then it should
jump to the new--

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.572
but I don't know how much.

00:30:28.572 --> 00:30:30.280
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You'd
put it in the bank

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.658
basically and draw the
interest off of it.

00:30:33.658 --> 00:30:35.450
AUDIENCE: This is a
temporary shock, right?

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.132
It's just once.

00:30:38.132 --> 00:30:39.840
AUDIENCE: Then you
can get the funds back

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.030
and you lend it again.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.725
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Either way.

00:30:44.725 --> 00:30:45.850
AUDIENCE: We're missing it.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:46.493
What's the--

00:30:46.493 --> 00:30:48.410
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, no,
no, I'm just saying--

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.950
no, no, you got close.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.560
I mean, the point is the
permanent income model

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.110
isn't going to get you this.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.320
And you've got to have
these credit constraints.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.600
You've got to be something
that's generating hand

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.060
to mouth like behavior.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.780
AUDIENCE: So this is a shock
to the credit constraint not

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.410
the shock to income.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.720
So you should be facing
this credit constraint--

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.230
you should be constrained.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.770
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, that's right.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.450
And therefore, you're going to
see that this overall average

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.180
is masking a very
big differential

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.060
impact in the population
depending on whether someone's

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.485
at that constraint or not.

00:31:28.485 --> 00:31:29.860
AUDIENCE: But even
if you are not

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.902
constrained, if you
anticipate that in the future

00:31:31.902 --> 00:31:35.630
I'm constrained,
endogenously you--

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.040
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It depends
on the interpretation.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.310
Suppose you thought,
you know, the government

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:45.030
gave the money lump
sum to the households

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.310
indirectly through
the village fund.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.220
And they just put
that in the bank.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.490
Then their net
worth has gone up.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.610
They don't have an obligation.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.790
Within the village, they
are borrowing and lending

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.830
against this fund.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.990
But the village, as a whole,
just got a whole lot richer.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.820
And they would
potentially, if you

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.600
believed in the
permanent income,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.290
raise their asset level, right?

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:13.050
And then get the flow off of it.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.550
Yes?

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.040
AUDIENCE: How is it financed?

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.150
Is it something like--

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.358
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Taxes.

00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:23.150
AUDIENCE: But like the
taxes mainly hitting

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:23.840
cities instead of villages?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.190
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.362
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:28.295
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Matt.

00:32:28.295 --> 00:32:29.670
AUDIENCE: So I
was a bit confused

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.980
between the OLS and
the IV, because what

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.400
is the expansion
variable in OLS I

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.740
was thinking it must
be credit per person.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.580
But then I don't
understand really

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.180
what the instrument is, right?

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.730
Because if its credit per
person it's just a million

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.370
divided by number of households.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.155
And that instrument
itself is per household.

00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:55.530
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
So there's a lot

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.670
of variation in
short-term village credit,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.910
both among households within
a village and across villages.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.830
So we're identifying
this through

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.020
the cross-sectional variation.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.370
We're saying what part of the
increase in observed increase

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.880
in short-term village credit
can be explained simply

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:19.620
by inverse population size?

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.920
And the OLS doesn't do that?

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.490
It's just a flat out regression
credit on the right-hand side

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.460
and impacts on the left.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.070
All credit.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.070
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: And, you know,
net income growth is positive

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.035
in 3 to the 4,
including the OLS,

00:33:42.035 --> 00:33:45.600
or 2 of the 3 if you don't.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.130
And so there is some
impact on overall growth,

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.045
not levels, growth.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.635
And this is by source of income.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.490
You know, we see
a hint of profits,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:10.929
apropos the first two three
slides of the lecture today.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.639
Profits may be going up.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.300
And wages and salary
payments are going up

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.530
pretty consistently.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.010
So again, you know,
what that's all about?

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.060
But I've already
given some of it away.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.790
The wage rate that's
going up for villages

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.920
that got a higher
per capita treatment.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.580
And potentially
employment goes up.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.219
Yep?

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.742
AUDIENCE: So this slide and
the previous slide as well.

00:34:38.742 --> 00:34:40.659
I mean I understand we're
talking about bahts,

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.760
so the quantities are big.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.742
But like some of yours are huge.

00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:49.810
ROBERT TOWNSEND: But
you can see the stars.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.810
AUDIENCE: No, no, no,
I understand that.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.610
But even in the previous
slides, on stuff

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.963
that's like the growth rates,
the standard errors are big.

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:00.130
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, Yeah.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.370
AUDIENCE: You don't get clear
zeros and stuff like that.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.008
So--

00:35:04.008 --> 00:35:06.300
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Wait, I'm
not sure what you're saying.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.550
Yes, the standard
errors can be big.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.820
That would make it tough to
identify significant effects.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.847
But we on occasion do
find significant effects.

00:35:13.847 --> 00:35:15.180
AUDIENCE: No, I understand that.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.546
I'm just wondering-- my question
was more of as technical one.

00:35:18.546 --> 00:35:26.130
Like how-- is there a way to
sort of make them smaller.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.670
I mean I guess it's an issue
of ID and stuff like that.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.170
But--

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.330
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Well, you know, this

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.680
is with clustered standard
errors and the whole thing.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:43.500
And we try to eliminate the
outliers to see if that's kind

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.570
of causing a lot of the noise.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.330
Sometimes it does.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.070
It doesn't do that consistently.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.280
OK.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.610
We don't find much with
ag or other sources

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:00.490
of income or livestock.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:05.120
Now, as I said,
we also have a lot

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.340
of post data, post-intervention.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:15.470
Even when we wrote this thing,
we're up to six years of data.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.910
But this is OLS.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.800
So you have to take it with a
bit more of the grain of salt.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.220
For example, consumption
isn't showing up,

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:30.700
even initially because we're
not instrumenting anymore.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.080
The probability of default's
kind of moving around.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.100
And it doesn't go away.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.280
And that's a real issue.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.330
And let me show you
the default rates.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:43.920
And, you know, potentially, by
the way, there should be a lag.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.430
Depending on exactly
where the 12 month falls,

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.130
you borrow one year and
you can't repay the next.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.270
Net income goes up.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.300
But it's not
significant after that.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:08.580
And short-term village
credit remains high.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.330
Well, what do I want to say?

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.510
Back to models, you'll
get one, don't worry.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.280
You know, the
world isn't static.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.320
And we just shook
things a little bit,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.160
because these villages
arguably are wealthier

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.430
than they were and they've
also somehow used this

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:37.125
to capitalize basically a
savings and loan association

00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:38.250
within each of the village.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.400
So if you were in
a steady state,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.430
and someone smacked you in
the head with something good,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.150
you might expect the adjustment
isn't necessarily insta--

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:52.710
all the dynamic models we
have with frictions, Paco's,

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:57.360
for example, suggests there
are slow transitions even

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.760
to some ultimate
new steady state.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.650
So this is rare, this look
at these-- now, granted,

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:10.800
the model's going to be partial
equilibrium, even though we

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.315
have some data on local wages.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.100
And there's a guy named--

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.790
is it Furfine who has a study?

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.270
Pandi and Burgess had
this study in India

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:30.280
where the government
changed the branching rules

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.620
and showed impacts on poverty
and all of that stuff.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.350
But he went back after
they published their paper

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.090
and looked at the
long-term impact.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.170
And he thinks something like
this was going on in India too.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.490
So again, apropos, you
know, RCTs, well, no one

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.200
claimed the contrary,
but if you don't

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.870
know what happens
afterwards, you're

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.120
kind of left with the
impression and hope

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.640
that the program effects, if
they were positive, persisted.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.980
Here, they're definitely
mitigating over time.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.210
Yes.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:10.710
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
long-term impact on wages?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.674
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I don't
think we looked at that.

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:16.120
That would be good to do.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.920
We struggle with the wage,
because the annual data

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.060
measure it very well.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.770
So this is the one thing that
we use the monthly data for.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.410
And we only have 16 villages.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.810
So it's quite problematic.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.200
Most things we try don't
show up because of the sample

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.720
size is too low and the
standard errors just kill us.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.170
But I don't think we actually
looked at long-term wages.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.490
So that would be good to do.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.196
Yes.

00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:49.198
AUDIENCE: Do you think the
wage data in CDD is any good?

00:39:49.198 --> 00:39:51.242
Daily wage for laborers.

00:39:51.242 --> 00:39:52.950
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I
think when you sort of

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.880
look at geographic averages
of things, yeah, that it has--

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.360
there are beautiful maps
showing how wages, not size,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.910
but wages move as you
get near urban areas

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.950
and get near Bangkok.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.980
And so arguably, something
could potentially--

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.920
I wouldn't trust any
one head man's response,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:20.370
but with 72,000 data
points, you can do a lot.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.518
AUDIENCE: So that paper,
his name is Fulford.

00:40:22.518 --> 00:40:23.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Fulford.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:32.230
OK, so this is a
cautionary tale.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.250
I'm going to skip it.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.760
If we have time,
I'll do it next time.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.874
That would be a
better context for it.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:48.230
So I've been trying to clue
you into the puzzles all along

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.730
in terms of--

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.920
the one thing I didn't
say was about investment.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.040
And I had mentioned
in other lectures

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.590
that investment doesn't
happen very often.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.270
And when it happens, it's big.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.320
So it's quite lumpy.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.910
And we're going to want
to incorporate that.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.990
But the flip side
of that is we're

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.500
going to have trouble
finding effects of investment

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.700
both in the IV and in
the structural model,

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.250
and the data generated
from the structural model,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:25.730
if we limit that data
to the same sample

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.980
size that we have in reality.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.070
But when you see the
structural model momentarily,

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.390
you can imagine a 10-fold
increase in the sample size

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.820
because we can generate
as much data as we want.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.940
And then, we definitely get
these investment effects.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.460
So, you know,
arguably one reason

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.480
still on the table that we
don't see microcredit directly

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.130
in terms of
investment activities

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.950
is simply a sample size issue.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.900
I mentioned that
because, you know,

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.640
people write reviews
of what do we

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.760
know about microcredit
and whether or not it

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.710
having an impact.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.930
And there seems to be
a bit of a consensus

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.410
that at best, impact
is quite mixed.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.110
And maybe, you know,
non-existent in many studies.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.860
And people come away with
this impression that, at most,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.150
it's all about consumption.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:21.910
But I think that's a little
bit of a rush to judgment.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.460
I'm not saying it
has to be this too.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.530
I don't have more data
in reality than we have.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.260
So we're going to have
this precautionary savings.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.130
We're going to have some limits
because of those consumption

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.100
numbers I showed you.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.588
We're going to allow default.
It does happen in reality.

00:42:41.588 --> 00:42:43.630
And we're going to try to
match the default rate.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:47.540
And we have income growth.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:57.860
That's actually arguably the
hardest thing that we did.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.640
And I'll try to say something
about why it was hard.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:11.990
But we actually allow
persistent growth in the model.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.440
OK, so what is the model?

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:22.080
Liquid stuff is just your
current income plus your return

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.030
on previous year savings.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.780
Now, this reminds
me to say, you know,

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.440
so why aren't you doing
moral hazard or costly state

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.890
verification or
full information?

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.970
Hey, we just had a
lecture about that.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.670
Same kind of data.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.390
Alex and I showed that
in the rural data,

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.660
the best approximation is
something simple like savings

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.970
only or limited borrowing.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.030
Now, we got lucky,
because Alex and I

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.280
did that after Joe and
I wrote this paper.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.270
But it is at least
very comforting

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:04.780
that the best micro
underpinning that we now think

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.560
exists out there was the
micro underpinning that

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.620
was being used in this paper.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.290
Likewise, I would not
expect to get the same thing

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.100
in the urban areas,
because there, Alex and I

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.030
found moral hazard was
a better approximation.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.410
So here, it's sort of this
incomplete market's macro type

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:33.220
literature or development
literature, for that matter.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.620
Rotsio swears by this stuff.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.920
And it's in logs.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.140
So income looks like it's
just a multiplicative

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.820
transitory and permanent shock.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.300
That makes the log of
income equal to the log

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.200
of some permanent thing and the
log is some transitory thing.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.350
The log of the
permanent thing almost

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:02.250
looks like a random
walk, where log Pt plus 1

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.820
equals log Pt plus
log N. So this is

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.030
the shock to permanent income.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.510
This thing is the shock to
transitory income, where

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.990
income is measured in logs.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.170
Now, it's not quite
that because G

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.790
is this drift, this damn drift.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:21.920
It's 4%, by the way.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.135
So you know, there's kind of
sustained growth, not modeled.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.700
You get this boost to
your permanent income.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.290
It's like TFP type stuff.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.490
And then what's this?

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.497
So investment, you
know, why invest

00:45:40.497 --> 00:45:41.580
if it doesn't do anything?

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.955
Well, on the
contrary, investment

00:45:42.955 --> 00:45:48.670
gives you a boost of your
permanent income, right?

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.920
So this is this decision whether
or not to invest, a dummy.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.990
And this is the amount
of the investment.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.760
As I said, investment
opportunities

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.960
arrive stochastically
from a distribution

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.280
with a non-trivial mean.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.470
So on average,
it's chunky, which

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.840
means you may choose not
to do it because it's

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.380
too big to swallow.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.840
You don't get a choice
about the size though.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.430
If you do it, you've got
to do the size that arrived

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.370
to you as an approximation.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.970
Although again, I've said
this, we see this in the data.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.965
People don't do sort
of half chicken coops.

00:46:28.965 --> 00:46:32.440
A chicken coop without
a roof is not a coop.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.263
OK.

00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:36.401
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the drift term.

00:46:36.401 --> 00:46:39.930
I think we have in
papers we have--

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.900
we basically assume some
exogenous technical progress

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.800
pushing wages up
and then like papers

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.780
where the focus on
the structural model

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.805
is to model that,
because obviously

00:46:52.805 --> 00:46:56.720
like that's really important
if Thailand over this period

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.835
there was 4% drift where
everyone or maybe--

00:46:59.835 --> 00:47:01.210
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
It is important.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.080
And we're not.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.420
A lot of the literature
we've covered doesn't.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.190
Daron features that a lot.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.710
What is it?

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.060
Is it innovation?

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.911
What is this
technological progress?

00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:12.715
AUDIENCE: So would it be--

00:47:12.715 --> 00:47:14.950
Are there any
inherent reasons why

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.715
it would be difficult to
translate Daron's models

00:47:17.715 --> 00:47:21.920
to the Thai data or the--

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.420
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
It should be done--

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.572
AUDIENCE: With
regional variation?

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:27.030
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
It should be done.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.760
It hasn't been done yet.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.760
No, I don't see any
intrinsic difficulty.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.050
Actually, it's more
like a real opportunity,

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.290
because when you're on
the ground like this,

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.160
you should be able to see--

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.740
and in my data, you measure the
capital stock and labor input

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.240
and all of--

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.910
you know, if it's real
technological improvement it's

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:53.810
like, mm, getting rid
of the water buffalo,

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.880
and bringing in the
walking tractor.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.310
I showed you a picture
of the walking tractor.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.405
I said it was land,
labor, and capital.

00:48:00.405 --> 00:48:01.850
Remember that one?

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.380
Well, it used to
be water buffalo

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.740
and the people in
Bangkok still think

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.200
that you know the farmers are
out there with their water

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.730
buffalo.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.430
Well, I mean, it's
just not true.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.550
You know, they have pickup
trucks and all of that.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:22.970
So my point is that that's
real technological progress.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.370
And so data like
this potentially

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:31.280
could tell you whether
it's really that or just

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.040
potentially something else.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:41.550
It could be better roads, you
know, higher, easier access

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:45.390
to markets that
somehow showing up,

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:51.080
everything else equal,
but not modeled, and not

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.890
at a deep level.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:52.390
OK.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.640
So here's the max problem.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.560
Maximize discounted expected
utility of this household.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.080
Rho is sort of the
related to the coefficient

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.580
of relative risk aversion.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.030
Beta is the discount rate.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.450
This is as of, quote,
"initial period."

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.910
Here's the liquidity.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.700
That, by the way, was
the same as interest

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.350
on savings, short-term liquid
savings plus current income.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:32.320
And it can be spent on
consumption or saving

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.550
or investment.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:40.990
If you decide, D, to do the size
investment that has arrived.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.360
What are the state variables?

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.600
In any given day-- this
is true for every day, t.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.570
It would have been better,
and I don't have it

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.270
on the slides, to show you a
traditional value function,

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:56.530
where you'd have the utility
today plus the value tomorrow.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:01.270
But this does tell you what
the state variables are namely,

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.140
permanent income
today, liquidity today,

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.170
and the size of the
investment draw.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.100
So those are the
key economic states.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.780
That's households
are going to face.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.180
This is just a parameter.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.950
What is s bar?

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:18.360
Here it is.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.480
Now, it looks like savings
is bounded from below,

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.370
weird, weird.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:29.290
Well, actually savings
can go negative.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:29.980
That's fine.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.020
That's just borrowing.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.760
So this is a credit limit.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.120
It says savings can't
go too negative,

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.370
credit can't be too big.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.060
And it's scale by
permanent income.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.880
In fact, almost
everything in the model

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.200
is going to get scaled
by permanent income.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:57.013
Part of that is the permanent
income, we wanted growth.

00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:58.680
And the way to get
the growth is to have

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.977
this expansion exogenously
in permanent income.

00:51:01.977 --> 00:51:03.810
But the other thing is
you look at the data,

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.720
and you see, you
know, like investments

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:12.180
are large for small households
relative to their assets.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.220
And you go to larger households,
and their projects scale up.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:22.190
So it's not like you can
sort of accumulate wealth

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.020
and save your way out of
these non-convexities.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.750
So we scaled everything--
go to the other extreme--

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:31.140
we scale everything
by permanent income.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:35.160
The arrival of project
sizes and so on and so forth

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.010
and the shocks are all scale.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:43.160
And what I'm not writing
down, but we do in the paper,

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:49.260
is to actually turn this
into a balanced growth path.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.900
And the intuition is
pretty much what I said.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.250
The math is trickier,
where you just

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.960
divide through by p everywhere.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.540
So the control
variables are things

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:08.950
like consumption per
permanent income,

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.480
per unit permanent income.

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:16.170
And then we have to solve
the value functions.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:23.450
Now, these are the
stochastic processes

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:27.260
for the transitory shock.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.620
Again, everything is in logs.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:34.320
The permanent shock, so
these are log normal,

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.530
centered around zero with
these standard deviations.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.720
Project side is not
centered around zero.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.150
It has a non-trivial mean
with the standard deviation.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:50.490
And you're going to see
a table with parameters--

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:53.340
not to say you're
really memorizing these.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:56.970
I am, because I want
to go through the list

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:58.150
when we get there--

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.110
mu sigma, U, N.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.850
Here's a problem.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.640
We do have a borrowing limit.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.500
And we do not put in sort
of a natural borrowing.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:20.260
We let households default. They
default in the data, about 18%.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.250
It's not trivial.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.180
It's also hard to nail down
exactly when a loan is not

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.090
performing, because they can
stretch out the payments.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.970
So it's not nailed
at exactly 18%.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:37.370
And, oh, yeah, so here's
another story with a bonus.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:45.900
Econometrica requires the
codes for any published paper.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.960
So you've got to give them
the codes and the data,

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.820
which is good.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.090
It's a good thing.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.220
Of course, when
you're doing the work,

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:59.018
you don't really annotate as
thoroughly as you might do.

00:53:59.018 --> 00:54:01.060
And then when you're ready
to publish this stuff,

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.602
you're going to like
go back over it,

00:54:02.602 --> 00:54:05.600
and we found a mistake.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.740
And the mistake was
around this default rate.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.050
So we actually know,
for bad reasons,

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.355
that the default rate matters.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:15.777
Yes.

00:54:15.777 --> 00:54:18.710
AUDIENCE: So I saw two
versions of a paper

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:22.077
and they had quite
different welfare coverages.

00:54:22.077 --> 00:54:23.067
Was that--

00:54:23.067 --> 00:54:25.150
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
probably part of it, yeah.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.600
Well, look, everyone makes
mistakes in research.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.660
And it's in some respect
doing it over and over

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.270
is actually a good
thing, because you

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.160
get this robustness check.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.582
But, yeah--

00:54:40.582 --> 00:54:43.610
AUDIENCE: So in the data, when
we say a household defaults,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:47.052
what do we mean exactly by that?

00:54:47.052 --> 00:54:48.760
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Never
paid off the loan.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.302
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:49.302 --> 00:54:51.020
Because in most
microcredit literature

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.360
a default is what we
would call a delinquency

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.283
in the sort of developed
country finance literatures.

00:54:57.283 --> 00:54:58.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.575
AUDIENCE: So you're not counting
deliquincies as default.

00:55:00.575 --> 00:55:02.610
You're counting actual
defaults, like we just

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.222
never pay the money back.

00:55:04.222 --> 00:55:06.680
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You know, I
have to go back and make sure.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.700
We could have put something like
a two-year threshold on this.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:16.600
But, yeah, I mean, I always
actually go the other way.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.360
I tend to think of defaults
as a contingency in the loan

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.410
contract.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.090
The Bank for
Agriculture for sure

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:26.690
runs an insurance company this
way, where they extend loans

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.780
and actually even more
than that don't charge you

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.970
interest on the renewed
principle and so on.

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:38.970
So, you know, people
are risk averse,

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.520
having these contingencies
are a good thing.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.870
There is a literature on
this, other literatures.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.240
So anyway, there may
be other ways to do it.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.290
Measurement is tricky.

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:57.290
But we decided to
put default in.

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.717
And what is this thing saying?

00:55:58.717 --> 00:56:00.050
Well, it's a bit tricky to read.

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:03.170
But we don't drive people
down to zero consumption.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:05.780
We put in some
minimum consumption.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.100
No matter what, you're not
going to go below c lower bar

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:15.530
and, well, scaled by
your permanent income

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.960
as everything else is.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.310
Now, what is this other thing?

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:19.940
Savings.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.110
Well, put savings times
p on the right-hand side.

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.550
It'll pick up a negative sign.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:26.690
That's credit.

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:28.710
Minus savings is credit.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.450
So it's liquidity
plus the maximum loan

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:33.440
you could take out.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:46.610
And still, you can't cover
that minimum consumption.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.230
So you're not respecting the
budget constraint anymore.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.610
You get this, quote, "gift."

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:59.460
And then here are the rules that
happen and when you default.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.800
You're not investing.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.660
You're borrowing
up to the limit.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.375
And your consumption
is the scaled version

00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:07.550
of permanent income.

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:14.770
So let's see if I've done
my homework, or you have.

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.550
R is the interest rate.

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:21.250
This is the standard deviation
of the permanent shock,

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.830
standard deviation of
the transitory shock.

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:24.850
This is new.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.650
It's measurement error.

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.470
We imagine that we see
the data contaminated.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:33.710
It's a bit dirty
centered around the mean.

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.600
But this is the drift term.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.810
This is the lower bound on
consumption under default.

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:40.980
Beta is the discount rate.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.390
Rho is related to constant
relative risk aversion.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.160
Mu is the project size.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.630
On average, sigma i is
the standard deviation

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:51.510
of project size.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.660
And this is the credit limit.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:58.500
And R, big R, is the
return on investment

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.750
that augments permanent income.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.700
That's also quite problematic.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.050
What we did was use these
return on assets numbers.

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.770
But, Emily and Abhijit and I
have been working subsequently.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:17.300
And we think not
only does R vary

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.180
in the population with
some heterogeneity

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.000
that we don't have
here, but it actually

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.430
is predictive of who's
getting the money

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:30.920
and what they're doing with
it, which may be another reason

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.000
that we didn't get as far
as we thought we might

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.475
with the investment thing.

00:58:36.475 --> 00:58:40.490
But anyway hopefully, we'll
write that up real soon.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:45.250
Here, it's just a number,
calibrated, you might say.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.090
And we're going to
use method of moments.

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:52.080
Oh, now, a couple of questions
for you guys, or one comment.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.200
Back to the codes,
you know, Emily

00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:00.930
was about your cohort
in a class like this.

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:03.300
And very shortly thereafter,
she got interested

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.070
in the structural stuff.

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.180
The codes are all there.

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.840
And, you know, not only
the published version,

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.090
but all the other things,
you're welcome to have them.

00:59:14.983 --> 00:59:16.900
Probably a little late
to do it for the class,

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.460
but it's a resource
that's available to you.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.300
And, of course, in the end it
wasn't the paper with Abhijit

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.860
that's still not quite done.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:30.580
But she used structural modeling
in her job market paper.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.750
And she was learning it
by looking at those codes.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.550
So the other thing
I want to ask you,

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:43.880
I hope you've seen at some point
methods of simulated moments.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.940
One yes, three, four yes, OK.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.230
So we're going to--

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:53.720
AUDIENCE: For those of us who
took Devop 771 in the Fall,

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.910
Esther had a problem
set on your papers.

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.900
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Have you
learned have something

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.064
new today?

01:00:02.064 --> 01:00:05.382
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:05.382 --> 01:00:07.567
Like we did the methods
of moments already.

01:00:07.567 --> 01:00:08.400
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.040
All right, that's excellent.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.560
Yeah, that's excellent.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.400
I guess I knew that.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.640
I'd forgotten.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.630
But anyone, I'm
glad you know it.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.130
So I won't try to reteach.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:28.120
There's not time today.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.160
OK, another
controversy, what to do

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.230
with all the
heterogeneity in the data

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.110
that we don't have in the model?

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.110
I'm emphasizing certain aspects
of observed and unobserved

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:42.330
heterogeneity in the data.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.159
That is in the model.

01:00:45.159 --> 01:00:49.630
But we've also got all
these demographic stuff.

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:55.730
Now, granted not everyone
would do it this way.

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.490
We take it out.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.420
So we filter the data basically.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.800
We regress the household
data on these observables

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:12.960
and as well as time trends,
potential initial business

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.250
cycle, i.e.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.000
the initial data is one year
after the financial crisis,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.890
the whole country is kind of--

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:25.340
so the controversy is, well,
why don't you just put it in--

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.150
and I'm not going to
have time this year.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.370
But I have lectured
in previous years

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.070
on Keane and Wolpin and stuff.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:35.490
So if you want to see a really,
really long specification

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:39.690
of what you can put into
the utility function,

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:40.973
I'm not debunking it.

01:01:40.973 --> 01:01:41.640
It's a perfect--

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.086
[AUDIO OUT]

01:02:18.393 --> 01:02:20.060
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We
kind of estimate it.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.920
But this is almost
like calibration,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.430
because we have earned interest,
which is interest time savings.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.200
And we have savings and
interest in the data.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.100
So we are trying to minimize
to get the mean right.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.780
The other things
that are more fun--

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:48.590
consumption, decision to invest,
and so on is just basically

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:53.260
looking at consumption
in the data.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:57.550
And this is expected consumption
through the lens of the model.

01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:00.060
It's conditioned on observables.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.810
Liquidity is observed.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.990
And income is observed.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:08.190
Now, one caution, these are not
one to one with the key state

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.920
variables of the model itself.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.950
There are something
like permanent income

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:18.790
and project size relative
to permanent income

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:20.050
are the key state variables.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:21.600
And permanent income
is unobserved.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.840
So there's some work to
back out these expectations.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.940
But anyway, you
get an error, which

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.530
is the difference
between the observed

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.670
and the predicted values.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.520
And you kind of like want
to minimize the error term

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:42.310
by choosing the
parameter values here.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:50.410
Here's a la Blundell,
Pistaferri and Preston.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:57.270
We put in a log moving
average process for income.

01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:02.480
So if you're judicious about
choosing log differences far

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.780
enough apart, you can
pick up the drift.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:10.250
It's really very similar
to what BPP we're doing.

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:17.640
And that's how we
get that G basically.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.190
So these are time
differences in growth rates.

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:26.310
Maybe I don't need to--
and then, of course,

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:31.570
you can pick up other moments
by the orthogonality conditions

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:39.333
on error terms, assuming that
they don't see something else.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:40.750
If they were to
see something else

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.003
we're not seeing
in the model, then

01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:44.920
we're going to make a
mistake with these guys,

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.490
because there's going to
be information contained

01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:50.490
in the error.

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.360
But we assume not.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.420
Simulating, what
are we going to do?

01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:00.200
Well, first of all, how do
we relax the borrowing limit?

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.890
We allow that borrowing
limit, that s bar,

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:09.850
to move from one village
to the next in such a way

01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:12.910
as to predict the increase
in short-term village credit

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.020
that we see in the data.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:19.170
So that's how we sort of
calibrate the magnitude

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.507
of the intervention.

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:27.410
And the rest is simulation.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:31.130
We're going to draw these shocks
over and over again and get

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.210
repeated samples.

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:36.490
We're going to have basically
500 artificial data sets.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:39.170
Any one data set is
a series of draws

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:46.130
of the permanent transitory
project size and so on.

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:50.180
And we have the
pre-intervention years.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.940
You can stop there
and use the data

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.560
and estimate the parameters.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.120
You can keep going and see
what the model predicts

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.670
over and over again,
not just one path,

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.280
but averaging over these
500 different paths.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:10.850
Why do that?

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:14.160
Well, basically, you want
to get average tendencies.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.790
You don't want to be so
sensitive to the luck

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:22.820
of the draw in the first
year after the intervention

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.770
and the second year
after the intervention,

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:29.370
because we don't know what--

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:33.130
the model says-- we know
something about averages.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:34.255
In fact, then we run--

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.520
this slide really deteriorated
through the projector.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:58.360
But these are the economic
variables in the model itself.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.000
Liquidity divided
by permanent income,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.920
projects size divided
by permanent income.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:11.350
And what's going on here, as
you move in this direction,

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:16.120
there's three black dots here.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.940
And they're kind of
all fixing project

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.300
size and varying liquidity.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.630
So these guys down
here are bankrupt.

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.430
They're defaulting.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.410
They have almost no liquidity.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:36.480
They can't even really pay
back their previous loans.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.462
These guys, these are
these hand-to-mouth guys.

01:07:39.462 --> 01:07:40.545
This thing's really curvy.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.390
They're constrained.

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:47.940
They're liquidity constrained.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.980
That borrowing
constraint is binding.

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.310
These guys have drifted
into higher territory.

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.380
They're not actually
constrained anymore.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.820
But in the future, they know
there are credit limits and so

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.480
on.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.500
If you go this way,
you're basically

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.340
fixing liquidity and
varying project size.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.980
Now, the most interesting
part of the diagram

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.470
is the Grand Canyon here.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:21.560
And this sort of
pre-intervention,

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:28.229
this guy sitting close to the
cliff, he's tempted to invest.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.450
But given limited
resources, investment

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.270
would drive his
consumption really low.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:36.010
And he's not willing to do it.

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:38.770
But then you have this sort
of increment in the borrowing

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.210
resources.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:09:01.189
It's like another [AUDIO OUT]
that effect on consumption,

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:03.640
we've got these four.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.859
These guys don't move
consumption basically.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:09.939
Oh, well, let me get at the
welfare stuff right now.

01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:18.330
So for them, this credit
program is terrible.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:19.710
Why?

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.170
Because we're not going to
force them into default anymore.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.545
We're going to
make them take out

01:09:23.545 --> 01:09:27.580
a loan at interest, whereas
before they got exempt

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.359
from repayment.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:33.350
So welfare goes down
for these guys down here

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.750
as a result of the
village fund program.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:38.875
Welfare goes up for these
credit constrained guys,

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.500
because they're at
the borrowing limit,

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.330
and that's precisely
what this new program

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:44.372
is doing, at least through
the lens of the model.

01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:48.979
These guys, you'd say, well,
they're not constrained.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.490
No, but they're these
buffer stock guys.

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:56.850
And they now have
excess liquidity.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:59.650
Well, might as well
spend some of it.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.890
So their consumption
also goes up.

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.540
And as I just said,
these guys who

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:10.440
drop off the cliff, so
to speak, they actually

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.940
have consumption drops.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:16.440
So this consumption average
that we see, 1 to 1,

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:23.340
is this mongrel weighted average
of overall this heterogeneity,

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.980
of course, that we
only create sort of

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.140
through the eye of the model.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:28.840
Yes.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.470
AUDIENCE: Do you
understand the guy

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:33.580
who's like constantly
bankrupt is worse off?

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.120
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Because
before we would have forgiven

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.920
the loans, sent him to a minimum
consumption c bar and let

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.660
him start over.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.020
And now, he's saddled with
all that previous debt.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:51.120
And he can basically borrow more
against it at interest rates

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.575
and then have to pay
off in the future.

01:10:53.575 --> 01:10:55.800
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.490
Because we expanded his
ability to refinance,

01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:00.720
now he's worse off.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.410
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, exactly.

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.150
AUDIENCE: That's different--

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:04.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: If the
government exempts your loan

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.883
and you stay in the house.

01:11:05.883 --> 01:11:06.523
But--

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:07.940
AUDIENCE: So if
would be different

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.857
if you were borrowing
from a money lending who

01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:11.290
is going to break his knee.

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.570
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, so
you could imagine default

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.920
doesn't work like this.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.060
But that's the way it
works in the model.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:23.120
Anyway, and then you know after
they climb out of the cliff,

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.300
you get a repeat in terms of--

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:32.140
so if you looked at
those welfare numbers,

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.450
it's almost misleading.

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:38.060
In fact, I thought it
was wrong for a minute.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.070
This looks like it's just--

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:43.660
the bankruptcy region,
there are these huge gains.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.640
No, the bankruptcy,
these guys are losing.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.710
They're negative
numbers down here.

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:52.740
What happens is very
close, but not very

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.410
adjacent to that
bankruptcy reason,

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:59.220
the welfare gains just
you know rise like a tent.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.870
It's actually not vertical.

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:04.200
It's just coming up real
fast and then coming down.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.410
It's a very steep tent.

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.880
So these guys are
really in the program.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.860
And then these other
constrained people,

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.810
they're kind of
liking the program.

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:22.540
All these people are
actually relative to what?

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.150
Well, basically,
we use the model

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:29.580
to look at an
alternative program,

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.170
where they just get
a lump sum transfer.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:36.350
And we actually do this
consumption equivalent

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:39.470
calculation, which is
how much of a transfer

01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:43.460
would you have to
get to have a welfare

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.160
gain equivalent to the one
you get under a Million Baht

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.800
Program.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.710
And another way to say it, in
this region, the government

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:55.600
could have saved money.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.630
It could have gotten households
the equivalent welfare gain

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:02.360
without actually putting so
much money in the village.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.730
But it's very heterogeneous.

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:07.460
Some people are tempted, and
the abstract on the paper

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:11.000
actually talks about it
not being a great program.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.240
But I don't know, strictly
speaking, Pareto criterion,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.080
we can't say that.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.890
24% of the population
really love this program.

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:21.330
For them, it's wonderful.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.390
But more than the
majority would have

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.034
preferred a different program.

01:13:27.034 --> 01:13:27.678
Yep.

01:13:27.678 --> 01:13:29.220
AUDIENCE: So that
type of comparisons

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.125
is just looking in
people's welfare

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:34.820
in the model, not thinking
about cushion being administer,

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.500
for instance.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh, yeah,
we're extracting away

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.670
from the people who are
financing the programs.

01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:43.600
So there's all those
tax distortions

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.430
being created to
generate the revenue

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:48.675
to fund this program that aren't
involved in this calculation.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:50.050
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
was just thinking

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:51.050
organizational capacity.

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:54.260
So maybe one reason for
loaning to each village

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.210
is that by head count, there's
be a lot more variation--

01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:58.210
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Maybe--

01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.914
AUDIENCE: Than a simple version.

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:04.440
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
And then I just want

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:10.140
to say that we come back to
those IV regressions, two

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:10.710
comments.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:15.630
First of all, what do
these coefficients mean?

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:23.190
Well, you can think about
them as impact of the program.

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:29.780
But that's kind of
like a funny number,

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:33.730
because it's an average over
all these different people who

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:36.430
got treated differently
and had different views

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.380
about the program.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:43.240
So we're lucky in a way that
we saw this big salient number.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.260
And it helped us figure out a
model where something like that

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:47.890
could happen.

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:49.630
But then with that
model, we realize

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:56.190
this number is not a uniform
benefit for all the households.

01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:58.580
So in other words,
a big advantage

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.718
of a structural
model conditioned

01:15:00.718 --> 01:15:03.260
on believing that you're getting
the structure somewhat right

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.750
is that it allows
you to really look

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:10.000
at the distribution of
welfare gains and losses.

The other comment
is more favorable.

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:17.570
Since we did those
IV regressions

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:20.510
and I reported
them, we can run--

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:22.370
we can generate--
we did generate--

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:26.090
the data from the model over
and over again, as I said,

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:30.230
and then do exactly the same
IV type regressions on the data

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:34.500
from the model and take--

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.195
so we're comparing
apples to apples.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.290
It's kind of a funny
intermediate criterion,

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.630
but it is at least a
consistent criterion

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:47.970
that's used on the model
generated data as well

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:48.930
as the actual data.

01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:55.095
And the fit is
actually pretty good.

01:15:55.095 --> 01:16:04.040
So I think that's it.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.890
Thank you.

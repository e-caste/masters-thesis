00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.702
CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.410
Today we're going to
talk about something

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.110
you've been seeing
in the lectures.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.320
Specifically, we're going
to talk about continuity

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.946
and differentiability.

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:19.320
And we're going
to use an example

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
to see a little bit
what the difference is.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.320
That how you can be
continuous and not necessarily

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.470
differentiable.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.040
And how it's a little stronger
to have differentiability.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.770
So we're going to deal
with a piecewise function.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.867
I'm going to ask
a question, I'll

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.700
give you a little bit
of time to work on it,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.750
and then we'll come back.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.630
So the question
is the following:

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.170
for what values of a and b is
the following function either

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.720
first, continuous, or
second, differentiable?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.330
So the function is defined
in the following way:

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.790
f of x is going to be equal
to the function x squared

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.010
plus 1 when x is bigger than 1.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.270
And it's going to be
equal to a linear function

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750
where you get to pick the
a, which is the slope,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.040
and you get to pick the b,
which is a y-intercept, if x

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.650
is less than or equal to 1.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.200
So what I've drawn so
far, so that you can see,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.900
is that I've drawn
the part of x squared

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.070
plus 1 if x is bigger than 1.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240
So I've taken the x squared
function that starts at

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.980
(0, 0)-- or the
vertex is at (0, 0)--

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.800
I've shifted it up
one unit, and then

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.910
I've chopped off everything
left of and including

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.750
the value at x equal 1.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.540
So my question, again, is, what
choices do I have for a and b

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.040
to either first, figure out
what choices for a and b

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.150
allow this function
to be continuous

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.600
when I put in the left part-- so
the values when x is less than

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720
or equal to 1-- and
what values for a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.730
and b allow this function
to be differentiable?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.105
So I'm going to give you a
moment to work on it yourself,

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:49.830
and then we'll come back and
I'll work through them for you.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.560
OK.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.675
So what we were
doing, again, is we

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:57.890
were trying to
answer this question,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.600
choose values for a and
b that make-- first,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.650
let's look at the
continuity question.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.150
OK.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.920
So what we really
need is, we need

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.830
to have a linear
function that ultimately

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.362
goes through this point,
whatever this point is.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.070
We have to figure out
what that point is,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.500
and then we can figure
out what values of a and b

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.960
will allow that to work.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.730
So if I want a continuous
function, these a and b,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.340
again, they have to be such
that the line goes straight

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.360
through that point.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.900
So what is that point?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.770
Well, the x-value is 1.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.830
So what would the y
value have to be in order

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.380
to fill in that circle?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.510
We can actually look at f
of x and we can say, well,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.024
if I wanted it to be continuous,
then the y-value I need here,

00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:43.980
I need at x equal 1, is going to
be whatever the y-value is here

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.290
at x equal 1.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.240
So let me write that.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.170
Make a little space over here.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:59.410
So to answer question
one, I need a and b so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.027
that at x equal 1, y is equal
to-- well, if I put in 1 here,

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:08.610
what do I get?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.260
I get 1 squared plus 1.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.480
So I get 2.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.931
So I need y to equal 2
when x is equal to 1.

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:15.430
OK?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.140
So ,in other words,
down here again,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.520
let me just say before I go
on, this point is 1 comma 2.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.984
So what I need is
a line that goes

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:28.150
through the point 1 comma 2.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.700
OK?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.620
So what is that?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.410
That would be, in this case,
that would be, the output is 2,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.880
and the input is a times--
well, x is 1-- 1 plus b.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.730
So that means a plus
b has to equal 2.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.380
And that actually represents
all the solutions.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.260
So there are an infinite
number solutions I could have.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.505
And if you think about it,
I could draw some of these,

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:57.880
I could draw some
of these lines.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.300
So let's take, for instance,
b equals 2 and a equals 0.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.449
When b is 2 and a is
0, it's the constant,

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.240
it's the constant
function f of x equals 2.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.020
It's a straight line.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.550
That would graph-- going
to graph that here.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.935
That would graph
straight across,

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.090
and that would
fill in right here,

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.590
and this would be if
we had on this side,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.845
this is f of x equals 2.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:31.300
OK?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.110
I could also have chosen
a plus b equals 2.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.920
I could also have chosen
a equals 1 and b equals 1.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.890
So I could have slope
1 and intercept 1.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.015
Notice, by the way, this
one is not differentiable.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:42.970
Right?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.250
It's obviously-- there's
a significant break there.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.450
We'll see also, with a
equal 1 and b equals 1,

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.230
it's also not differentiable.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.570
So a equals 1 is slope 1, and
b equals 1 is intercept is 1.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.990
That's this line.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.390
So this is kind of
running out of room,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:12.980
but f of x equals x plus 1.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.610
Hopefully you can see that.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.650
f of x equals x plus 1.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.050
f of x equals 2.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.570
This one looks a little
bit closer to being almost

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.770
like the tangent lines are
going to match up there.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.880
But it's not quite.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.980
And we'll see in a
second what we will need.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.430
So this was, we answered
the continuity question.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.930
OK.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.660
So now let's answer the
differentiability question.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.247
OK.

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.330
Notice, again, continuous.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.150
We have a lot of
lines that will work.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.650
OK.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.560
But to answer the
differentiability question,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.630
I need the derivative as
I come in from the left

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.270
to be equal to the derivative
as I come in from the right.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.130
So actually, I think
I did that backwards.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.671
This is, as I come
in from the right,

00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.270
I need this derivative-- this
gives me a certain value.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.270
As I come in from the
left, I need a derivative

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.590
coming this direction.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.050
I need them to be the same.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.799
That's what it would
mean for the function

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:02.820
to be differentiable.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.080
I can write that in words.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.802
The limit as x goes to 1
from the left of f prime of x

00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:17.900
has to equal the
limit as x goes to 1

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.370
from the right of f prime of x.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.640
I'm not sure-- I think you
saw this notation already.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.387
Limits coming in from the left
are designated by a minus sign.

00:06:29.387 --> 00:06:31.970
Limits coming in from the right
are designated by a plus sign.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.530
So we need these two limits to
agree in order for the function

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.310
to have a well-defined
derivative at that point.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.790
So let's figure
out what this is.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.270
Because we have
the function here.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.060
The function to the right
of 1 is x squared plus 1.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.030
We know its derivative.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.910
Its derivative is 2x.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.511
So on this side,
we have the limit

00:06:57.511 --> 00:07:01.984
is x goes to 1 from
the right of 2x.

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:03.150
And now we can fill that in.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.410
What is that?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.870
Well, I just evaluate at
x equal 1 and I get 2.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.450
OK?

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.050
And now that means
I need the limit

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.340
as x goes to 1 from the left
of the derivative to also be 2,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.610
so let's fill in this side.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.300
The function on the left, at
the left of 1 is a*x plus b.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.160
So what is its derivative?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.950
Its derivative is just a.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.884
Right?

00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:28.800
Because the derivative
of b-- b is a constant.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.010
That derivative is 0.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.647
The derivative of this is a.

00:07:31.647 --> 00:07:32.730
OK?

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:40.570
So we get the limit is x
goes to 1 from the left of a.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.310
That's what this
left-hand expression is.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.129
Well, if I evaluate
a at x equal 1,

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:46.420
I can actually just plug it in.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.609
There's no x there.

00:07:47.609 --> 00:07:50.150
This is a constant function, so
as x goes to 1 from the left,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.710
I just get a.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.540
So that tells me that
a has to equal 2 here.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.040
OK?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.180
So in order to make the
function differentiable,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.420
I only have one value
of a I'm allowed to use,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.877
and that's when a equals 2.

00:08:05.877 --> 00:08:07.340
OK?

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.749
So I didn't draw this one, yet.

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:10.290
I didn't draw it on
purpose because I

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.280
wanted to save that for last.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.760
So when a is 2,
what's b have to be?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.590
Well, in order to
be differentiable

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.020
it first has to be continuous.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.780
So it has to satisfy
this, a equals 2,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.240
and it has to satisfy
this, a plus b equals 2.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.720
So that tells me a equals 2, and
it tells me b has to equal 0.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.345
That comes from our
work in number one.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.750
OK?

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.970
What does that represent?

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.950
That's a line with
intercept 0 and slope 2.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.830
So I'll draw that one last.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.782
Goes through 0, has slope 2,
so it goes through this point.

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:46.573
And if I draw those,
if I connect those up,

00:08:46.573 --> 00:08:54.070
we see, if we continued we see
that the tangent lines there

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.630
agree exactly.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.115
But the function itself
is just this part.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:01.970
It's just, the right-hand
side is x squared plus 1,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.200
the left hand side
is y equals 2x.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.180
So we've now figured
out how to make

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.310
this piecewise function both
continuous and differentiable.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.188
And we'll stop there.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.560
PROFESSOR: The thing we
have to talk about here

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.619
is multicellular life.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.820
Cells, although we can
think of them as entities,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
are generally not the
unit of a whole organism.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.290
There are many organisms
whose unit is a single cell,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.380
but the really interesting
ones are the ones

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.990
that have got lots of cells.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.630
And so life has
developed in a way

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.110
that most organisms
are multicellular.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.190
And we can pose the question
of why that might be.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.580
My trite phrase, while
it's more interesting,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.680
is actually a very poor answer.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.630
There's a much better answer.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.400
And that is if
you have something

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
made of lots of cells,
different parts of that organism

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.220
can specialize and
do different things.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.040
And so you can get a
diversification of function,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.460
which allows the
organism to colonize

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
new parts of the earth,
interact with its environment

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.510
in different ways, interact with
other members of its species

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.060
in different ways,
and it does become--

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.090
allow a much greater
complexity of life.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.890
So I would say--
the answer I would

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.800
give you is it allows
new functions to evolve

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.750
and greater complexity
of life to develop.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:14.160
If we consider the human
adult, and look and see

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.630
what we're made of, we contain
about 400 different kinds

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.620
of cells.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.220
We can call those cell
types where each cell type

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.630
has a specialized function.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.710
Those cells are
organized together,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.080
and they're located
in specific places.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.205
So the cell types are
organized into groups.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.820
They are organized into
three dimensional structures.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.300
One of the things that is
most interesting about living

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.090
organisms is that they're 3D.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.866
Think of it if we were all
sitting there as flat sheets,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.990
you know, you get the idea.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.500
The 3D-ness is extraordinary.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.520
And it's one of the things
that being multicellular

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.060
allows you to do.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.490
So cells are
organized into groups,

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.220
they are organized
into 3D structures,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.660
and this notion of groups
of cells and structures

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.700
is that they work together.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.620
Groups of cells arranged
in a certain way work

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.020
together to form
a whole, an organ,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.880
that has got an even greater
specialized function.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:08.580
So these work together
to make organs.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.180
And in particular, as
we'll talk about next time,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.270
it's the groups of cells
and their 3D structures

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.220
which makes the organs.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.079
And the organs themselves can be
organized into super structures

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.455
called organ systems.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.040
And we'll work on
all of these things

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.730
over the next
couple of lectures.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.870
Today we're going to
talk about cell type.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.030
Here is-- before--

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.030
I'm thinking if I should
show you a slide first,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.370
or if I should write
this on the board.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.050
Let me show you a slide first
because I want these next two

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.500
boards to follow
one from another.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.270
All right.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.460
Different cells.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.970
Oh!

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.720
There we go, OK.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.690
Different cell types.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.270
These are micrographs
of different cell types.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.930
Here are red blood cells, which
regulate oxygen transports

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.810
for metazoa involved
in reproduction,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.600
and neurons involved
in communication.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.900
Each of them has got the
basic cellular functions

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.320
that we've talked about over the
last lectures, but each of them

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.510
is obviously
morphologically different.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.810
They look different and they
carry out different functions.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.950
The cell types get
organized in specific ways.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.240
This is a really
extraordinary example,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.780
which is the retina of your
eye, the light sensitive part

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.560
of your eye, which contains
a number of different kinds

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.880
of cells.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.790
And these cells are
organized in layers,

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.490
and so they're color coded here.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.130
And you can see the different
layers are grouped together,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.260
but then the different layers
communicate with one another.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.370
And this communication, and
this organization is key.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.410
You can have all the different
cell types in the retina,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.460
but if they're not arranged
in this rigid structure,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.710
or in this specific structure,
the retina doesn't function.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.910
3D structures.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.300
We'll talk next time about
engineering structure

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.320
out of cells.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.940
And the heart is
one thing you have

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.680
to think about engineering.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.070
The only raw material that you
have to use for the engineering

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.890
is cells, and so how
do you get something

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.950
that looks like a human
heart, and carries out

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.390
the exquisitely regulated
pumping function of the heart.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.790
And here's another one
that I'll touch on,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.500
which is the
question of position.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.210
It's not that we
just are made up

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.840
of lots of different kinds of
cells that are grouped together

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.060
in organs.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.840
It's that they're
also positioned

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.560
in the correct place.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.740
And in this plasticized human--

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.530
actually, I think it's
a fully plastic human--

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.550
if you open up the cavity
and look into the abdomen,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.760
you can see these organs
that are arranged packed

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.770
so beautifully like this.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.330
It's no accident.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.000
They get there, because
they're told to get there.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.250
There is a process
that positions

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.080
the organs in the precise way.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.180
And if they're
positioned incorrectly,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.320
there are medical consequences,
which are very severe.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.170
All right, so all of these
things we need to think about.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.990
But let's go back to
the board, and you

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.140
will recognize
this diagram, which

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.540
is pivotal for what we're
going to talk about today.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.930
Here is a mantra that
I've mentioned before.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.470
And you need to know and
really need to understand this.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.875
All cells contain the
same set of genes.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.870
Professor Jacks will give you
one exception to this rule,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.210
but it's the exception.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.179
All cells in your body
contain the same set of genes,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.010
but not all those genes are
used in every cell type.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:46.660
But each cell type uses--

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.690
and you know the
word expresses now--

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:55.120
each cell type
expresses a subset.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.560
And it's a unique subset--

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.260
well, let me put
unique in parentheses,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.730
and you'll see what I mean--

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.415
a unique subset of the genome.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.930
And this set of genes and
the products of those genes

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.880
make the cell type what it is.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:30.740
The products of those genes,
usually proteins and some RNAs,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.760
give the cell type
it's function.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.790
So there are two
corollaries here.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.630
One, you have to understand
how the expression of genes

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.200
is controlled, and that
is pivotal to this list.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.120
And two, this set of
genes that makes each cell

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.600
type, the set of active genes
that makes each cell type what

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.340
it is, forms a kind of a
combinatorial code for a cell

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.430
type.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.400
So let's just write this down.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.955
So control of gene
expression is crucial.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.370
And there is a
combinatorial code

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.120
of gene expression
for each cell type.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:40.900
A combinatorial code
of expressed genes

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.890
for each cell type.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.750
You will not find this notion
of a combinatorial code

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.380
in your book.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.960
But I think if you talk to
any life scientist who's

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.210
doing research right
now, they would

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.460
agree that that
is the correct way

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.080
to be thinking about cell type.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.100
So let's explore
this a bit more.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.630
And let's write out three
different cell types.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.052
And I'm going to introduce
the word here cell fate.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.680
And both cell type and cell
fate can be used interchangeably

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.360
with the term function.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:40.660
And let's pick neurons, muscle,
and the epidermis, which

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.190
is the outer layer of the skin.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.320
And let's consider
the genes that

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.720
are present in each cell type.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.690
And let's consider
the genes that are

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.910
expressed in each cell type.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.140
The genes that are
present in each cell type

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.180
as I've just told are the same.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:16.530
And so let's make them
A, B, C, D, and E.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.850
And each of those genes is
present in each of these cell

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:26.740
types, but only some
of them are used.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:33.100
And so let's say in the
neurons A, B, and E are

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:44.860
used, in muscle A, C, and D
and A, B, and C in epidermis.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.510
So look at what
I've written there.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.810
And you can pick
out some patterns.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.240
You can pick out a
gene that is expressed

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.070
in all of the cell types.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:59.650
So gene A is expressed
in all of the cell types.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.610
And gene A exemplifies a gene
that we term ubiquitously

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.850
expressed, sometimes
termed a housekeeping gene.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.360
I really dislike that
term, but you will see it.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:21.560
So ubiquitous expressed,
maybe you'll see housekeeping.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.150
You can come to
office hours, and I'll

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.820
tell you why I hate that term.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.370
And then you can
pick out a gene,

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.770
which is expressed in some of
the cell types, but not others.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.330
So let's look at B.
Here's B expressed

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.340
in the neurons in the epidermis,
but not in the muscle.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.550
And B would be referred
to-- and actually C

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.440
is the same way, isn't it?

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.730
C is in muscle and epidermis.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.070
B and C would be
referred to as genes

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.170
with restricted expression.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.430
So B and C would have
restricted expression.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:09.480
And then there's two
genes there E and D,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.580
which are only expressed in
one of their own cell type,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.090
in neurons or in muscle.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.665
So D and E would be cell
type specific genes.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.750
And from this simple example,
you can see a number of things.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.010
Firstly, you can get
a combinatorial code

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.790
that is specific for a cell
type without any genes that

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.010
are specifically expressed
in the cell type.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.260
If you look in the
epidermis example,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.850
A, B, and C are expressed.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.520
None of them are a
cell type specific.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.430
But nonetheless, they give
the combinatorial code

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.260
that is the epidermis.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.660
And then the other examples,
they each got a cell type

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.240
specific gene.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.550
What is a combinatorial
code really look like?

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.370
Well, to be honest we
don't actually know.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.460
There is no cell type for
which the combinatorial code

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.090
is being worked out.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.070
But you know now there were
about 20,000 human genes.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.590
And probably about
half of them are

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.000
expressed in most cell types.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.960
So the combinatorial code
for any given cell type

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.140
is going to be thousands
and thousands of genes,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.600
which are expressed
or not expressed

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.760
and which are also expressed
at different levels.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.380
And we have to take
that into account.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.860
So really finding the
combinatorial code is

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.360
incredibly difficult.
And we don't

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.710
know any for any cell type, but
the notion is exactly the same.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.130
I want to remind you
here with this diagram

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.170
that the control
of gene expression

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.110
to give you the final
expressed product

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.160
can be anywhere all the way
from chromatin structure

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.640
through transcription all the
way through protein processing

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.590
modification and localization.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.950
Good.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.230
All right, so now
we have a framework

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.350
by which we can think
of what a cell type is.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.720
And the question, of
course, that you're asking

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.320
is, so how does that combine
tutorial code get expressed

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.429
in each of the cell types?

00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:14.470
Let's pose that question.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.040
How does a cell type
express its code?

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.890
And there's a couple of answers.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.240
The global answer that I'm going
to give you to this question

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.763
is stepwise.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.750
And let's have
stepwise answer one.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.590
The idea-- and we can do this--

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.840
I'm going to do this two ways.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.177
I'm actually going to do this--

00:17:01.177 --> 00:17:02.760
no, I'm not going
to do this two ways.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.329
Before we get there,
this is a great slide,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.619
which will show you two things.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.760
One, it will show
you the expression

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.819
patterns of two different
genes in the whole organism.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.550
So here is a gene called myoD.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.359
I've shown this to you before
that is cell type specific.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.180
It's just expressed in
these kind of chevron shape

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.849
things, which are the
developing skeletal muscles,

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.830
the voluntary muscles.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.050
And here are a
couple of genes that

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.370
are expressed in large regions
of the developing animal.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.290
And you can see they're
expressed, because

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.550
of these colors that
are there and the colors

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.350
are indicative of where
the RNA for that gene is.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.650
The technique that allows
you to look in a whole animal

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.760
and ask where the RNA is for
particular genes are found,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.880
is called in situ
hybridization, up here

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.470
at the top of the screen.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.350
And the idea is that
you take animals--

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.580
here, I've said embryos--

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.470
developing animals, and you fix
them, which means you kill them

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.820
and you permeabilized them.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.185
You make holes in
them, and then you

00:18:12.185 --> 00:18:16.960
use the principles of base
pairing, where you look and see

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.550
where the RNA is
using a probe, which

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.150
is an antisense RNA for a
particular gene of interest.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.240
And you label this
antisense RNA.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.730
You mix it with the
embryo that's got holes in

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:35.350
or the animal that's got holes,
where the RNA for gene x is.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.940
It will base pair to
your antisense probe.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.170
You then wash out the extra.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.320
And you look and see where the
color that comes from the label

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.280
is.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.560
And that color tells you where
the RNA for a particular gene

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.060
is.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.240
So these colors in
the developing animal

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.340
tell you where
particular RNAs are.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.260
It's a very powerful technique.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.770
And it allows us to figure
out which genes are cell type

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.920
specific and which genes are
more generally expressed.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.635
Let's look at your
first handout.

00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:11.260
And I'm going to
write it on the board,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.180
as well, because this
is really important.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.790
And you're going to need to
know this for this lecture

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.600
and when we get to
stem cells, as well.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.090
So you can look on the screen.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.380
You can look on your hand-out.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.750
And I would suggest
you write it, as well.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.240
The notion when we're
thinking about cell type

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.530
is that we start off with cells
that don't know who they are.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.390
And they're called
uncommitted cells.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.750
They're undecided.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.040
And as they go through
life, they get some inputs.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.392
We'll be vague about those.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.100
They're up there.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.130
I'm not going to
write them here.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:20:00.700
And at that point, they
become committed cells.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.525
They are sometimes
called determined cells.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.380
And at this point,
the cells have decided

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.120
what they're going to become.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.180
And later on, those committed
or determined cells will go on.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:28.270
And they will become
differentiated cells,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.885
where they have their final
fates or their final function.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:43.750
There's a time metric
on this progression.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:49.000
And the notion really is that as
cells go through this decision

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.750
making process, they
change which genes they

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.650
are expressing, such
that at the culmination--

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.870
but if you think about this
or come and talk to me,

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.790
you'll find it's
more complicated.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.610
At the culmination,
they will be expressing

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.170
their combinatorial code.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:15.420
Uncommitted cells, as they
transition to committed cells,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.530
activate a set of genes that I'm
going to call regulatory genes.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.180
They're the
transcription factors,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.735
the translation factors, the
protein processing factors.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.410
And these regulatory
genes will then go

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:45.710
and activate a set of genes
that I'll call effector genes.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.420
And the effector
genes are the ones

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.270
that are actually carrying
out the function of the cell.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.830
They are the globin
that's carrying

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.720
the oxygen around the body.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.610
They're the
neurofilaments that are

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.280
making the neurons long
and strong and able

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.960
to transmit a signal.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.980
They are the cartones, which
make hair cells able to secrete

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.100
the hair that actually you see.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:16.200
So the effector genes are the
functioning, the functional

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.926
mediators.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.830
And it's this mix of
regulatory genes, which

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:28.190
I've written as R, an
effector genes, which

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.770
I've written as E, which
form the combinatorial code

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.670
for a cell.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.390
So that's one answer.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.850
And you have more
up there, which

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.187
we'll come to in a moment.

00:22:48.187 --> 00:22:49.645
But let me give
you another answer.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:02.680
It's also the same
answer stepwise,

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.910
but this answer has to do with
the history of an organism.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.010
I've avoided talking
about embryos,

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.840
until now, because I
wanted you to think

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.630
about the outcome,
the cell types.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.460
But actually, all
of this starts--

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.210
cell type formation starts
right at the beginning

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:25.050
of an organism's life,
when two haploid cells,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:34.900
the egg and the sperm, magically
get together and join to form

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.495
a diploid cell, the zygote.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:49.220
This zygote, which
is also a single cell

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.850
is itself a magical
cell, because it contains

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.110
all the information necessary
to form whatever organism

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.590
is going to be the outcome.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:05.080
The zygote goes on
to form an embryo,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.785
also diploid that
contains many cells.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:20.470
And the embryo goes on to
form the diploid adult, also

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.700
with many cells.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.310
And in humans,
there are about 10

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:32.700
to the 14 cells in
the human adult.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.830
And during this process
of two single cells,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.900
two dying cells, the
egg and the sperm

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.870
are with a very
finite lifetime, when

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.022
those cells fused
with one another--

00:24:45.022 --> 00:24:46.980
and we're not going to
talk about this any more

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.980
than that then this discussion
because of time constraints.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.260
When they fuse to
form the zygote,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.080
there is an extraordinary
process where the zygote is now

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.990
resurrected in its life,
and it has the capacity

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.780
to give rise to
the whole organism.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.220
What happens during
this process?

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.540
Well, firstly, I've
pointed out, cells divide.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.060
There's a lot of cell division.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.060
And that's really key to
getting different cell types.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.910
You have to have
something to work with.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.560
And as they divide,
they become different.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.950
According to the list on the
screen and on the board above,

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:42.410
the egg, the sperm, in fact,
are differentiated cells,

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.080
but let's start with
the zygote, which

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:52.910
is undetermined or uncommitted
and undifferentiated.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.190
And I'm using determined
and committed deliberately

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.890
interchangeably so you get
the idea that the terms are

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.370
interchangeable.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.780
So the zygote is undetermined
and undifferentiated.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.780
And as it goes through
its embryonic stage,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:26.410
determination starts,
continues into the adult.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.160
And later during late
stages of embryogenesis

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.850
and into the adult cells
differentiate and become

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.510
their final thing.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.170
So determination
starts in the embryo

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:44.740
and sometime later the
process of differentiation

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.810
starts and continues.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.810
And so that's a second way
of actually writing out

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.800
the stepwise phenomenon of
how cells become different

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.830
from one another and how
different cell types are

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.580
formed.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.937
Let's take a look
at some slides here.

00:27:01.937 --> 00:27:03.770
And let's take a look
at a couple of movies.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.460
This is a movie of the first
few weeks of human development.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.650
And what you will be
able to see from this

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.430
is the enormous increase in
size of a human embryo that's

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.420
coupled with cell division and
also with cell determination.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.730
And it's going to play again.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.450
And what you can see,
up until about day 56,

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:33.980
we all had very nice tails,
and then they disappeared,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.730
unlike other animals.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.940
But all of these are
taken at the same scale.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.340
And so you can get a sense
of the huge amount of cell

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.870
division that's going on during
these first few weeks of life.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.010
Here's a second one.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.230
This is a zebrafish embryo.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.780
And I want you to
watch this embryo

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.620
as it develops very rapidly
much more rapidly than a human

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.040
during the first 19
hours of development.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.740
The fish embryo is kind
of like a chicken embryo.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.050
There's a big cell
called a yolk cell.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.800
And on top of this yolk cell
sits a little other cell,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.300
which is the embryo itself.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.520
And it's this little top cell.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.380
Here it's already
divided to give rise

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.280
to two cells from which the
embryo is going to arise.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.320
And so as you watch
the movie, you'll

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.800
see these two cells dividing
into four, into eight, and so

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.340
on.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.150
And then you'll be able to
see the beginnings of the fish

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:27.690
emerge.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.190
And I'll play it
a couple of times

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.540
and point out some
things to you.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.050
Here's the cell
division, taking place.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.190
It's not as rapid as
this, but it's of course,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.920
a very rapid process.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.500
And now you have a little
cap of cells on the yolk,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.150
and watch what happens.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.840
That cap of cells spreads
out to cover up the yolk.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.790
And a lot of cells
move to that side

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.680
of the embryo, the right
hand side of the screen.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.780
Here's the eye
emerging in the brain.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.260
And here are the
muscles of the fish.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.470
And let's watch it again.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.410
Isn't that cool?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.440
So let me stop it.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.860
Here at this stage, you have
got several hundred cells

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.514
that are sitting on
top of this yolk cell.

00:29:12.514 --> 00:29:14.680
This pointer seems to have
died, but they're sitting

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.610
on top of the yolk cell.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.110
And you will be able to see
when I start the movie again

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.600
how those cells
spread out to cover.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.940
And they are actively doing it.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.750
They know to do it.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.490
They actively
spread out to cover

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.230
the surface of the embryo.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.330
And then actively
a group of them

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.260
moves to one side of the embryo
to form most of the embryo,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.600
including all the nervous
system, the muscles,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.985
the intestines, and so on.

00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:39.985
So let's start it again.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.225
There you can see these
cells spreading out.

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:48.850
They've spread it
out to this-- they've

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.560
spread out to this point.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.327
Let's let them
spread out some more.

00:29:53.327 --> 00:29:53.910
Here they are.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.280
They've completely
closed up the yolk.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.500
And if we stop now, you'll
see on the right hand

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.520
side of the screen.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.570
There's a much thicker
group of cells.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.070
They're thousands and thousands
of cells now that are there.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.640
Now at this point, if you
look at gene expression

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.760
in the embryo, you can pick
out many different regions

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.140
of the future brain.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.150
You can pick out the
future intestines

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.240
and the future muscles, but
there is no differentiation

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:18.840
at this point.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.250
The cells do not know.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.930
The cells have not
finished becoming

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.370
what they are becoming.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:31.240
And here as we go on a bit
more, here is the eye up front.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.920
And these bumps of the brain.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.960
And then these little
chevron shape things

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.020
there are the future
muscles, your fish fillet.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.690
And there is the fish moving on.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.265
It's really a fantastic process.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.750
Very good.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.330
Let's go back to
the board and talk

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.900
about this more theoretically.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.140
We have sort of answered
a question here.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.720
How does a cell type
express it's code?

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.690
Well, not all at once,
over time and over a series

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.290
of many steps.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.530
But that's not actually
the whole on answer.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.240
And so let's rephrase
the question to make

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.440
it a little more precise.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.850
And I've rephrased it by asking,
what tells a specific cell type

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.005
to express its code?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.430
What tells a specific cell
type to express its code?

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.521
And the answer is--

00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:44.520
it's just not going to
be really helpful to you,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520
but it will in a moment.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.180
The answer is that there
are a bunch of inputs.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.610
There are a bunch
of instructions

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.670
that the cell gets.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.510
And let's write this out in
a kind of theoretical way.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.970
We'll get to the
molecules in a moment.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.860
Here again are our
uncommitted cells.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.350
And they can be exposed to a
number of different molecules.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.990
The inputs-- let me
just come clean here.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.480
The inputs are
specific molecules.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.730
And as you'll see in
a moment, they all

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.660
have got something to do with
cell signaling or regulating

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.390
gene expression.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.510
These uncommitted
cells can be exposed

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.850
to many different inputs.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:35.060
Let's take three
different inputs.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:40.760
We'll call them
input 1, 2, and 3.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.770
And these inputs through
many steps and changes

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.790
in gene expression.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.660
And the inputs can be composite.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.570
They don't have to
be a single thing.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:02.610
We'll take those cells into
differentiated cell type 1,

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.520
cell type 2, or cell type 3.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.930
And cell type 1--

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.700
you know, to belabor
this, we'll express

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:24.440
code 1, cell type
2 code 2 et cetera.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.560
As these decisions are
made similar to the kinds

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.190
of decisions we've looked at
in biochemistry previously.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.200
There can be interactions.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.420
And so it may be that as cell
type 1 develops, it's actually

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:45.734
inhibits the formation
of cell type 2.

00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:49.040
And cell type 2,
in turn, might be

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.640
an inhibitor of the
formation of cell type 3.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.660
So there are interactions
between cells.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.500
So the inputs can be composite.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:12.650
They can composed of several
molecules factors if you like.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:22.310
And there's crosstalk,
just like the crosstalk

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.830
between the receptors
that we talked about

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.690
in cell-cell signaling.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:31.429
And that's not surprising,
because in fact the inputs

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.650
includes cell-cell
signaling molecules.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.730
So there's ligands and receptors
that we spoke about previously.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:39.769
So what are the inputs?

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.060
And there are two.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:57.000
One are signals that
act between cells, just

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.950
like we've been
talking about in cell

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.870
biology, cell-cell signaling.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.080
And wherever you talk
about cell-cell signaling,

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.870
it is implicit that you're
talking about interactions

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.290
between cells.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:24.450
Ligands, which in development
are sometimes called inducers,

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.700
acts on the receptor.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:36.260
And the outcome is
to change cell fate.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.880
This is a subset of the
signaling interactions

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.430
we talked about previously,
where the response

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.760
here or the response
previously was manyfold,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.940
the response here would
be to change cell fate.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.790
But there's a second
kind of input.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:36:05.710
And those are the molecules
that are cell autonomous,

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:11.620
also referred to as
being inherited factors

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.970
and referred to in
development as determinants.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:26.030
And these determinants-- this
is what cell autonomous means--

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.485
act within cells.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.880
And so they're not going to
be ligands some receptors.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.470
They will be
things, for example,

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.930
like transcription factors.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:57.320
Furthermore, both
determinants and inducers

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.470
can act in a concentration
dependent way

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:04.610
so that a small amount
would give you one cell fate

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.120
and a larger amount would give
you a different cell fate.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.110
So it can be
concentration dependent.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:25.110
And in the cases where a
signal or a determinant

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.110
is concentration dependent,
it gets a special name.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:34.030
It's referred to as a
morphogen, for historical, not

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.960
particularly logical reasons.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.790
But if you see the
term you'll know.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.120
And finally, before
we go to some slides,

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.720
one can find groups of
these inputs, groups

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.750
of these regulatory molecules.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:57.030
So all of these inputs, all
of these other regulatory

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.630
molecules or regulatory factors.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.040
And they can act
spatially in groups.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.460
So you can find regions of
the developing embryo, where

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.800
there are groups of these
molecules acting together.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.520
And where you find these
groups, that particular region

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.630
of the embryo may have a
powerful effect in influencing

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.940
the cells which form around it.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.720
And that region, that group
of factors in one region

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.520
that can influence
its surroundings

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.150
is called an organizer.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:40.660
So groups of signals,
which are localized,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:54.590
that is in one place,
in one group of cells

00:38:54.590 --> 00:39:05.790
can influence the
surrounding cells

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.600
and is termed an organizer.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:15.550
And there are many organizers
in the body both in the embryo

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.170
and in ourselves
as we'll discuss

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.890
when we talk about stem cells.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.510
Examples of organizers,
I'll show you in a moment.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.630
There's something called
the Spemann organizer,

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.740
which is very famous.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.070
And some of you may have
learned about that previously.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.910
And then there are
regions, for example,

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.350
in the forebrain, the
developing cerebrum,

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.810
where there is an organizer
that actually tells

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.960
the different parts of you
developing higher cortical

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.940
function to form.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.690
So let's look at some slides
and some of your handouts.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.210
And I drew these
for you, because I

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.030
thought it was really
important that you got them.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.500
Here is localized determinants,
localized regulators

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.440
called determinants.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.690
And you see the idea here.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.530
This is important.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.360
This isn't on the board.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.150
Here's the mother
cell with these boxes,

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.000
where these boxes represent
some kind of regulatory factor.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.290
And you can see I've drawn
them on one side of the cell,

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.740
such that when that cell
divides one of the daughters

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.860
doesn't get them and
one of them does.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.730
And if the boxes are
regulatory factors,

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.180
the daughter's cell that gets
them will go on to do something

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.170
different than the
one that doesn't.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.860
And you can get two different
cell types coming out of this.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.460
And I've listed examples
of the many different kinds

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.060
of factors that can
be determinants.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.780
Here's a real example.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.840
This is an early worm embryo.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.880
Remember, I told you
about Professor Horvitz,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.060
who got the Nobel Prize
for discovering cell death

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.410
processes.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.320
This is the same
animal he works on.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.950
And on the top panels are
nuclei stained in blue

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.870
with this dye called dappy.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:09.980
Here's the zygote.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.630
Here's the two cell embryo
and the 32 cell embryo.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.610
And you can see that there's
a nucleus in every cell.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.950
On the bottom are
some determinants

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.950
that are called pea granules.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.350
Pea granules are composites
of protein and RNA.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.860
And they are regulators of
where the future germ cells will

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.140
form, the future egg and sperm.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.690
Look how these germ-- look
how these pea granules

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.820
segregate during development.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.140
Here they are on one side of
the embryo, even in the zygote,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.820
and then the zygote splits.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.850
Look, one of the two
cells gets them more

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.300
and the other does nothing.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.560
And at the 32 cell stage, there
is one cell out of 32 that

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.420
has all of the pea granules.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.580
And they've been
excluded or degraded

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.310
from the rest of the embryo.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.260
And that is a really
beautiful example,

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.360
perhaps the most
beautiful example

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.600
of determinants segregating.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.710
Here's another one,
the signaling factor

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.360
secreted by neighboring cells.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.110
Uncommitted to cells over
time will do something.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.650
There's enough transcription
factors and regulatory factors

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.570
in all cells that
over time they'll

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.180
go on to differentiate
into something if they're

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.830
normal cells.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.760
But there's a signaling cell
telling an uncommitted cell

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.790
to activate a signaling pathway
and go on and make cell type 2.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.650
And these are the
inducers, which

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:38.750
are ligands binding to
receptors and changing sulfate.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.260
These signaling pathways can
act in a concentration dependent

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.630
way, as seen on that screen.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.610
And here is the notion
of a morphogen, where

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.230
a high ligand
concentration will give

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.250
an output of cell type 2
and low ligand concentration

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.810
and output of cell type 3.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.320
And we touched on how this works
molecularly, previously, it's

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.420
not well understood
and is complicated.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:10.440
This is the most
famous example of cells

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.040
that can go on and tell
other cells what to become.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.520
It's a group of cells that was
termed the organizer before it

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.640
was clear that there were
actually lots of organizers.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.130
And they organized was defined
by a graduate student Hilde

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.620
Mangold, together with
her advisor, Hans Spemann.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.250
Mangold, unfortunately, went on
and was killed in an explosion.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.440
Spemann went on to
get the first Nobel

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.800
Prize for developmental
biology in 1935.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.180
It's never seemed fair.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.010
It isn't fair, anyway.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.500
That is a sad story.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.430
Spemann was the preeminent
developmental biologist

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.690
in the 1920s.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:52.530
And this is the finding
that Dr. Mangold made.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:58.440
She took an embryo and she
removed from the embryo--

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.260
so you not only do
you see my calendar--

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.980
you get an insight into
the rest of my life.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.210
My husband is a professor
over at that other university.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:13.760
So we have competing
teaching schedules today.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.920
So Dr. Mangold took a group
of cells from the future back

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.380
of the embryo-- we'll talk
about this next time--

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.470
and she transplanted
them into another embryo.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.420
She transplanted
them into the belly.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.700
So she took back
cells and put them

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.380
in the future belly
of a host embryo.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.080
So there's a donor and a host.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.540
And she could see the difference
between these embryos,

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.430
because they had
different pigmentation.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:38.555
They were different colors.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.310
And then she let them
go on and develop.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.560
And this was a hugely
difficult experiment

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.060
in those days for
technical reasons.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.660
But over a period of
a couple of months,

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.280
these embryos developed.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.350
And what she found was
this peculiar embryo,

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.740
which is a conjoined twin.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.810
And she could show
by looking to see

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.910
where the cells she
had transplanted in

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:05.570
were, that there was this host
embryo that was made of all

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.790
the original host tissue.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.220
And there was another
embryo joined to it

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.970
in this orientation, but
that only a little bit

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:19.130
of the second embryo actually
came from the donor cells.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.940
Most of the second embryo
came from the host cells.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.980
And this was epiphanal,
because she could understand

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.800
that those donor cells
had told the host

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.540
tissue to make another embryo.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.530
It was an extraordinary
unprecedented finding,

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:39.780
and it gave the notion
that cells can tell

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.030
other cells what to become.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.180
Does this happen in
other animals for sure?

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.210
This is from a colleague
of mine Jerry Thompson, who

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.830
made these conjoined twin
frog embryos by organizer

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.420
transplants.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.020
Does that happen in humans?

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.590
It does.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.240
Conjoined twins come from,
we believe, organizers

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.460
that have split
and have given rise

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.220
to two embryos, which
don't separate properly

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:05.930
from one another.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:13.840
And we will stop there
and continue on Monday.

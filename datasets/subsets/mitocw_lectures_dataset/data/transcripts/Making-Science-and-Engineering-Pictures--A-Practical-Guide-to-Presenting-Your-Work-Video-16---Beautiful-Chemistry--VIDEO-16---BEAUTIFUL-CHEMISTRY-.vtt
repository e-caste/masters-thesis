[FELICE FRANKEL speaking]

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.610
In this week's
discussion of video,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.560
we're going to show you
some interesting examples

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.210
of other peoples' work.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.270
Now, remember that
the basics of still

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.660
photography that
you've just learned

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.430
all these previous weeks, apply
to making successful videos.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.600
For starters, we are
incredibly lucky to be

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.610
able to show you some remarkable
videos from a project called

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.580
"Beautiful Chemistry".

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.380
Here's the website
with full credit.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.160
Now I encourage you
to see them all.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.410
I am quite sure they
will inspire you come up

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640
with your own amazing
videos, if your work requires

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.760
video capturing
macro-level phenomena.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.400
Scientist Yan Liang, a
collaborator of mine,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.220
is the creator and
director of the project.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.620
We asked him to tell us a
little about his techniques

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.590
for three of the videos.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.930
Welcome, Liang, to our class.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.110
[YAN LIANG speaking]

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.890
Thank you, Felice.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.630
It's wonderful being
part of this course.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.150
I'd be happy to talk
about how we captured

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.320
three particular phenomena.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
In this segment we're showing
metal displacement reactions.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.330
We dropped zinc metal
into different solutions

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.300
and recorded the emergence
of beautiful structures

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.650
of other metals such
as silver or lead.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.740
All reactions were
shot in real time

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.340
and we sped them up during
editing in Final Cut Pro X.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.590
For example, one sort
of silver displacement

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.729
was sped up 60 times, which
means one second of our video

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.509
is one minute in real time.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.039
For light setup, we used
two large LED panels

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.479
to light a cubic glass
container in which

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.120
the reactions occurred.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.660
Typically, a black cloth
or a white plastic board

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.560
was placed about one
foot behind the container

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.410
as black or white background.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.910
And we shot reactions
in the front

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.940
with a Panasonic GH4 camera
and 100mm macro lens.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.520
All the reactions were
shot in a normal lab

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.400
with overhead
fluorescent lights.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.038
Because the LED panels
were so much brighter

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:15.600
than the fluorescent lights,
we typically left them on.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.500
In this segment, we are
showing a few crystallization

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.300
processes, including
crystallization

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.360
of copper sulfate, sodium
thiosulfate crystallization,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.901
and two more.

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.350
We chose crystallization
processes

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:31.890
that are fast enough so that
we could shot in real time

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.860
and speed them up in editing.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.750
We did not select
crystallization processes

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.440
that could take hours or
days to form large crystals.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
For those, time-lapse
photography has to be used,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.910
and lighting and exposure have
to be carefully controlled

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.260
to avoid flicker
in the final video.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.280
Finally, in this segment, we
are showing a few bubbling

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.880
reactions, such as zinc metal
reacts with hydrochloride acid

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.630
to form hydrogen bubbles.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.440
These reactions are
fast and we usually

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.000
did not need to speed
them up in editing.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.190
Our light setup worked
well for bubbles.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.600
The white highlights on
the right and left sides

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.430
of the bubbles are the
reflection of two light panels.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.660
These highlights gave bubbles
a very interesting look.

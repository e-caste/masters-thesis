00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.960
This week, we'll
discuss applications

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.390
of analytics that were
designed to disrupt

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.500
a standard way of thinking.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.050
In the first lecture, we'll
use analytics to model expert

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.630
opinion, specifically
in predicting

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.530
the quality of health care.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.860
In the second lecture, we'll
discuss the Framingham Heart

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.250
Study, one of the most
influential medical studies

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.830
the 20th century.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.260
Through these examples,
we'll introduce

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.560
classification problems and the
method of logistic regression.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.530
Let's get started.

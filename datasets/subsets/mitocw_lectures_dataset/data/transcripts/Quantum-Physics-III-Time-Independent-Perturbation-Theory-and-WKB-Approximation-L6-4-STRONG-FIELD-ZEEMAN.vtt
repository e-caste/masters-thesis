00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:14.140
PROFESSOR: So B
strong field Zeeman.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.940
So what did we say we would do?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:27.880
We would have H0 plus e
over 2mc B Lz plus 2Lz

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.590
B. This would be our
H0 check I call it,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.660
plus delta H fine structure 1.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.370
And we said what
we have to do now

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.520
is strong field Zeeman is more
important than fine structure.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.040
So we first have to
get the strong field

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.610
Zeeman figured out, with
the bare bones hydrogen

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.355
atom, what it does.

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:11.300
And then on those states, we
will do perturbation theory

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.780
for fine splitting.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.910
So it is redoing fine splitting.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.230
And you say oh my
god, that's hard.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.930
We spent a whole
lecture doing that.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.830
Well, second time you do
things, they go a little faster.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.890
So it's not that bad.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.920
But here there is
something quite remarkable.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.840
This was supposed to be
your known Hamiltonian.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.580
And you say no, it's not known.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.170
I never solved this before.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.110
On the other hand, when
we had H0 plus delta

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.530
H1, a fine structure,
we did struggle.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.030
And we found those states--

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.590
approximate states.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.315
Here the situation happily
is surprisingly simple.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.640
And one reason for
that is the following.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.370
That again, perhaps
your initial impression

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.500
this can be solved exactly.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.560
You don't even need perturbation
theory to add this term.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.600
What?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.190
Yes!

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.390
This Hamiltonian
commutes with H0.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.700
Isn't that right?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.320
H0 is rotational invariant.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.440
So it commutes with any j.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.230
Uncertain H0 has
nothing for a spin.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.360
It's a one matrix there.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.970
So this commutes
with Hamiltonian.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.390
So it's possible that you can
diagonalize this completely.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.940
Simultaneous-- eigenstates
of the first part

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.880
and the second part, so
simultaneous eigenstates

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.430
from all of those!

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.330
But the news is even better.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:06.660
Your uncoupled states--
uncoupled states n, l, m, l,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:18.100
m, s, those were eigenstates
except eigenstates of H0,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.410
the all good ole hydrogen atom.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.960
But actually they are
exact eigenstates of lZ,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.040
and exact eigenstates of sz.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.650
So they're exact eigenstate
of the Zeeman Hamiltonian.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.370
So they state are it.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.370
These are the exact
states of H0 hat!

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.560
These are exact eigenstates--

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.425
eigenstates of H0 check--

00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:56.925
I'm sorry.

00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:07.275
Its was not hat with
eigenenergies as follows.

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.140
There are no mystery,
the eigenenergies,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.690
they're very simple.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.570
The eigenenergies are
e, n, l, ml, l, m, s.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.610
Exact are e, m, 0, the ones
that the hydrogen atom has

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.130
that don't depend on any of
these other things plus eB

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:49.500
over 2mc eh bar B
over 2mc ml plus 2ms.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:00.950
So this serves perfectly the
name of known Hamiltonian.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.500
That was not the
case for weak Zeeman.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.410
And weak Zeeman who had this
one and this one, and the other

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.220
was the approximately
known Hamiltonian, to which

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.830
we added the weak Zeeman.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.630
Here, it's this perfectly
known Hamiltonian, to which we

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.280
have to now add fine structure.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.850
So maybe the last
thing that helps

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.960
you visualize what's
going on is to understand

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.030
what happens to the splittings.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.700
Because you're going to have
to fine structure splitting.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.550
And fine structure again,
you will have to ask,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.020
can I use non- degenerate
perturbation theory or can

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.790
I not use it?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.570
So you need to know what
happened with the degeneracies

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.520
after you add this term.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.790
Are all that the degeneracies
of the hydrogen atom

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.600
broken by this term,
or do some survive?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.010
If they survive, is
fine splitting diagonal

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.580
in those degenerate
subspaces or not?

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.110
So the most important
thing is figuring out

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.850
what are the degenerates spaces
after you've added this term.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.280
This is intuitively
what you have to do.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.380
If you approach this
problem OK, I now

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.800
have to compute fine
structure on a new basis,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.920
and you have no idea
what the new basis is,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.250
you are proceeding a little
bit with your eyes covered.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.120
You should always try to make
things a little more concrete.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.150
So look at the n equal 2 states.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.120
You have l equals
0 and l equals 1.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.930
Here, you have six states.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.850
Remember, their spin.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.320
There's two states here.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.330
The two states of l
equals 0 have ms equal 1/2

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.730
and ms equal to minus 1/2.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.860
So they're going to split.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.496
This number is going to be
either plus 1 or minus 1,

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.620
and they're going to split.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:21.860
And here-- so this is plus 1 on
this factor here, this number,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.300
or minus 1 for that number.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.170
For this states of l
equals 1, ml for example,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:36.080
can be 1, and ms plus 1/2--

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.630
so 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.050
So there is a state of 2.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.750
Ml equals minus 2 minus
1, and this minus 1/2

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.930
gives you minus 2.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.105
So that's another state.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.490
You can have more states.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:10.260
For example, if you take
ml equals 1 and ms equals

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.600
2 minus 1/2, you get the 0.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:25.800
But you can also have ml equals
minus 1 and this plus 1/2--

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.490
plus 1/2, which
also gives you 0.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.940
So here there's a degeneracy.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.110
There are six states.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.720
You will see that there
is one here and one there.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.500
So here is the nature
of the degeneracy.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.470
The six states have
split like that.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.130
There's a degeneracy
across l multiplets.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.410
And there's a degeneracy
within l multiplets.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.300
So two types of degeneracy.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.340
And that's what you will
have to consider when you

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.110
think of the fine splitting.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.830
In fact, the problem
in the homework

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.670
gives you some sort of trickery
to evaluate this expectation

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.530
value with a little less work
than the traditional method,

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.170
but still asks the
question whether you

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.010
can use the generator or
non-degenerate perturbation

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.640
theory.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.710
And that's an
interesting question.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.690
And this example, can help you
visualize a little better what

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.410
kind of degeneracies you have.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.550
OK, we're concluding a chapter
in the history of [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.760
six.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.470
We're done with
perturbation theory,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.620
and we're done with hydrogen
atom for the moment.

WEBVTT

00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:11.890
NANCY KANWISHER:
OK, so we are now

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.160
going to do the third part
in our sort of trilogy

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.390
of uniquely human functions.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.510
So starting a few
weeks ago, we moved

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.580
from things that are
shared with animals,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.630
like navigation and basic
visual perception-- very similar

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.660
between humans and monkeys.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.960
And other number--
all of these things

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.140
that are shared with animals,
to talk about functions

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.460
that are uniquely human.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.750
And that includes
music and language.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.170
And today, we're going to talk
about the coolest and most

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.900
quintessentially
human mental function

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.100
and that is thinking about
each other's thoughts.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.500
So to get started thinking
about this, let me remind you

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.720
guys of what should
be pretty obvious--

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.630
that we human beings
are profoundly

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.450
social in many, many
different respects.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.880
So if you think about--

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.620
if you recount what
happened in your day

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.020
to someone else, pretty much
all of the elements of what

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.040
you're recounting our
interactions with other people.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.580
These are the things
we care about.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.320
These are the basic
structure of our lives.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.430
Other people are the source
of our greatest happiness

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.480
for most of us.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.892
If you ask people at the end
of life what matters most,

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.350
they'll say I
shouldn't have wasted

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.760
all that time working so hard.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.320
And my job didn't matter.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.990
And I didn't realize, actually,
it's just other people are

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.290
the only thing that matter.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.450
Interactions with other
people, or lack thereof,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.290
are also the source of
one of the deepest kinds

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.760
of human suffering
for many of us,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.820
whether it's an everyday thing
like a breakup with a lover,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.110
or a loss of a loved
one, or a family member--

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.390
and also depriving people
of social interactions.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.390
This is, like, society's kind
of strongest form of punishment,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.960
is solitary confinement.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.090
Interactions with other people--

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.889
our failure to
understand them is

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.960
devastating in the
case of autism,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.270
where people struggle
to understand what

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.790
other people are all about.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.910
And in terms of our amazing
abilities as human beings,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
most of what we know we
learn from other people.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.640
Sometimes, we figure
stuff out on our own.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.450
But if you take an inventory
of all the stuff you know,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.890
you read about it or
somebody told it to you.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.310
You learned it
from other people.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.210
And consequently, some of the
greatest feats of humanity,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.270
from arts to science
to everything else,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.990
are products of people
working together.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.430
OK, further, many people
have hypothesized that social

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.190
cognition, or ability to
understand and deal with--

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.780
interact with other people--

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.660
is one of the strongest
drivers of the evolution

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.840
of the human brain.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.870
So many have argued
that the hardest

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.580
problem we solve
on a daily basis

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.480
is understanding other people.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.520
And it's also a very
important problem.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.495
And so that's a powerful
natural selection force,

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:11.620
understanding other people.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.410
And that has shaped the
structure of the human brain.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.930
Not everybody agrees with
that kind of extreme view,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.000
that it's the primary
driver, but it's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.170
an interesting hypothesis.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.530
And it surely played some role.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.310
Social cognition also is
just a very large percent

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.720
of human cognition.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.530
And it's a large in terms
of minutes of every day.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.002
If you tally up different
forms of social cognition,

00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:36.460
this is one we're
doing right now--

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.400
and we're about to engage in
an hour and 20 minutes of it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.025
right here.

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.650
And probably, when
you leave this room,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.820
you'll engage in other
kinds of social cognition.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.960
So it's just a large percent
what we do all day every day,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.520
and it's also a large percent
of what the cortex does.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.750
So roughly that
stuff and other bits

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.950
are engaged in different
aspects of social cognition.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.940
OK, so what exactly
is social cognition?

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.250
To get a sense of
what is entailed

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.020
in social cognition,
which is a very

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.090
complex, multi-part,
multifaceted enterprise,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.380
I'm going to show you a
short video of an interaction

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.498
between a bunch of 18-month-old
infants and an experimenter.

00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:24.290
And what I want you to
do is just watch it.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.840
It's very charming,
but also think

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.058
about what these kids
must know to be able to do

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.100
what you're about to see.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.480
Can you see the screen there?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.980
OK.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.940
OK.

weirdo doing this thing.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.017
Never met that guy before.

00:05:12.017 --> 00:05:12.850
Here's another case.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.040
He's dropped a clothespin.

00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:28.384
- Ah!

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.070
Oh.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.860

What are those little

there's another one.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.838

Let's go on.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.140
What did you notice about
what those little kids were

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.810
able to do?

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.910
What is entailed in
being able to do that?

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.590
What have they figured out--

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.610
lots of things.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.360
Yeah--

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.860
AUDIENCE: They
understand intention.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.780
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.370
Yeah-- yeah, all they're
doing is watching this guy do

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.570
these clumsy actions.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.150
And he's not saying
anything, he's just grunting.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.450
And they're figuring out
what he intends, absolutely.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.740
What else?

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.960
Yeah--

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.750
AUDIENCE: --sort of being
able to interpret the sounds

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.113
of grunts that the

00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:02.780
so especially, like,
a lot of confusion.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.340
Like, the-- sound.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.340
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh-huh.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.882
Yeah, one could ask
which of those things

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:10.840
are more important-- the
actions or the sounds.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.423
I don't think they
took it apart here,

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:14.070
but it's an
interesting question.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.140
Yeah so they understand some
kind of vocal communication--

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.050
not language, but
some kind of intent.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.640
That may be part of it.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.350
Yeah?

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I meant how
to be helpful without doing--

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.308
something for real?

NANCY KANWISHER: I didn't hear.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.815
Without-- sorry.

AUDIENCE: Without
interfering with whatever's

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.740
coming in their way.

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.190
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, they
know how to be helpful.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.590
But not just they know how--
they have a will to be helpful.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.800
Remember, these kids
never met that stranger

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.790
before this video started, or
maybe a minute or two before.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.460
So it's fascinating--
not just what

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.510
they're able to figure out, but
what they're motivated to do.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.880
Right, that's a
quintessentially human thing,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840
is to spontaneously help a
stranger who you've never met

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.150
before and are not related to.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.930
OK, all right, so--
but focusing more

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.460
on the cognitive abilities.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.350
What you need to do to figure
out another agent's actions

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.990
is to figure out what
that agent is doing.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.020
And that's externally
observable.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.830
You can watch.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.530
You can use your perceptual
system, construed broadly,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.540
to figure out what
is this person doing

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.150
in some general sense.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.910
And that's important, and
subtle, and multifaceted,

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.563
but it's nowhere near enough.

00:08:30.563 --> 00:08:31.980
Really, what you
want to know is--

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.340
why are they doing that thing?

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.429
OK, and that's not
directly observable.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.820
You can't see the why
of a person's actions.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.320
You have to infer it.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.840
In fact, to infer it,
you have to infer a bunch

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.030
of hidden mental states.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.330
And those things are much
more abstract than just, I'm

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.877
picking up the phone.

00:08:51.877 --> 00:08:53.210
You know, that's just an action.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.460
You can see it.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.960
But if you try to think about
why am I picking up the phone,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.970
now we're in a whole
different ballpark.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.390
And so what you
need to figure out,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.630
to figure out the agent's
hidden mental states--

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.500
you need to figure out what
can that agent see or hear.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.450
OK, and here, it's
really important

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.190
to not lose a level here.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.100
We're not talking
about what we can see.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.450
In understanding
another agent, we

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.700
need to understand
what that agent can

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.800
see about someone else.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.990
OK, so we're getting
kind of meta here--

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.070
multiple levels.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.770
OK, we also need to understand
the other agent's desires

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.290
and goals of what they want,
or what they're intending, OK.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.950
So how might we figure
these things out?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.195
Sometimes, there are simple
cues that might suffice.

00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:48.320
So you might make an
inference like, if a person is

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.470
reaching for an object,
they want that object.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.590
OK, so there, the
externally observable thing

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.420
might give you a
pretty direct inference

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.380
about the internal hidden
state of what the agent wants.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.980
OK, but a lot of times,
that's not going to work.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.100
Right, that's going to work
in some cases, but only a few.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.550
And further, the
percepts and the goals

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.280
that we've mentioned
here aren't enough.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.330
OK, they'll work in some
cases, but humans do much more

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.630
than that.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.690
So let's consider this case.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:27.180
Here's an agent who's
doing some action,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.410
and we can observe
their body motions.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.500
And what we want
to understand is

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.810
how this other
agent watching them

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.540
is going to infer
things about this guy.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.490
OK, so we're
interested in what's

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.600
going on in the mind of this
guy, as they watch that guy.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.840
OK, now let's consider
the case that this guy is

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.520
trying to understand--

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.600
this is Romeo here.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.040
Why did Romeo reach
for the bottle?

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.640
OK, well to understand why
Romeo reached for the bottle,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.740
you need to perceive and
infer a whole bunch of things.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.880
You need to see the hand
reaching for the bottle

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.110
to know what happened, but
then to really understand

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.050
the case of Romeo,
you need to understand

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.080
that his intention is to drink
the liquid in the bottle.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.760
That's why he reached for it.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.340
OK, you can't see the
intention to drink the liquid.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.560
You can only see the reaching.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.060
Then, you further
need to understand

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.192
why is he intending
to drink the liquid.

00:11:28.192 --> 00:11:30.150
Well, because he believes
the liquid is poison.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.810
I don't know why my pop ups are
all messing up here-- whatever.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.680
He believes that Juliet is
dead, and he wants to die.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.060
OK, so all of that
is part of what

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.710
is entailed in understanding why
Romeo reached for the bottle.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:57.140
OK, and crucially the stuff
in red, these things are--

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.410
the beliefs and desires are
not directly observable.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.670
They're highly abstract.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.720
And they're crucial.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.910
They are the best way to
explain and predict behavior.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.850
So when we need to
understand other people

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.770
and what they're
doing and why, we're

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.370
in this abstract space
of beliefs and desires.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.880
We can't see them directly.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.780
We have to observe.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.170
We have to infer
them indirectly.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.913
And they're essential,
because that's

00:12:23.913 --> 00:12:25.830
what we need to do to
understand other people.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.680
All right, so we talked before
about perceiving an agent--

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.100
I'm sorry, about inferring
what an agent can perceive,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.890
and inferring the agent's
desires and goals.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.990
But as I just
pointed out, we also

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.130
need to know the agent's
beliefs-- what they think.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.980
So all of this stuff
in here, inferring

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.560
the hidden mental
states of agents

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.590
is what we mean by mentalizing,
inferring other people's

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.880
mental states.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.220
OK, in the cases we're
talking about here,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.770
we're inferring the
percepts of another agent,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.440
inferring the desires
of another agent,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.780
and inferring the beliefs
of another agent--

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.450
OK, all this abstract stuff.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.800
OK, no computer system can
do this, not even close.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.970
See, we can still say that.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.095
We can't say that about
object recognition anymore,

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.440
but we have this
little precious reserve

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.690
where we can still say that.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.080
No animal can do these things,
except in very restricted

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.810
cases.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.740
So there's an active,
ongoing research program

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.310
and a bunch of labs testing
chimps in subtle tasks

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.290
to try to figure out when
they can infer things

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.210
about the mind of another
chimp or a person.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.150
And there are a few
restricted cases

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.620
where they can make
some inferences

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.840
about the mental
contents of other agents,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.720
but the current dominant view
is that those inferences are

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.800
very restricted to very
particular situations,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.470
usually involving
competition over food.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.640
And they don't
generalize in any way.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.480
OK, so in this whole
enterprise, specific cues

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.240
like making an
inference that reaching

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.600
for x means wanting x
will help in some cases,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.820
but will only get us so far.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.200
OK, we do much more than
that, and the question is how.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.590
All right, so
inferring mental states

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.780
to understand other
people involves

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.480
inferring their percepts, their
beliefs, and their desires.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.170
OK, so how do we do this?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.400
Well, a first question
that we ask in this class,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.260
and it's kind of a
sensible thing to do,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
is we were trying to understand
this whole space of how people

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.350
think about another agent's
percepts, beliefs, and desires.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.660
We might just think,
OK, maybe that's just

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.340
part of generic cognition.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.327
Who says that's a separate
domain of cognition

00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:44.660
that we should study separately?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.450
Maybe we should just
study thinking in general.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.700
Thinking about objects,
thinking about physics,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.760
thinking about people, maybe
it's all the same thing.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.300
OK, so let's start
by considering,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.850
is it really a separate thing
from the rest of cognition?

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.090
OK, well, there's a
classic behavioral paradigm

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.362
in this field that's provided
some evidence in this.

00:15:06.362 --> 00:15:08.320
You may have heard about
this in other classes,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.360
but we'll talk about
it, because it's

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.130
so kind of fundamental
to all of the work

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.860
on thinking about other
people's thoughts.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.410
And that is called the
false belief paradigm.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.990
It's really a way
of testing beliefs.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.480
And the reason you test
false beliefs rather than

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:27.180
true beliefs is if you ask about
another agent's true beliefs,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.610
then your prediction about
what they're going to do next

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.590
is confounded with what
is true in the world.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.500
And if you want to
really tap into what's

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.700
going on in their mind,
as opposed to what

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.200
would be true in
the world, you have

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.510
to use a false belief
to pull those apart.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.180
OK, so the classic
way this is done,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.805
the Sally-Anne task
goes like this.

00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:50.430
There are many variants
of it, but this

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.950
is the classic,
original version that

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.530
appears in hundreds of papers.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.120
So here's Sally and Anne,
and Sally puts her ball

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.620
in the basket.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.320
OK, you show this
to little kids--

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.600
or animals, too,
versions of it--

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.130
we're doing the
little kid version.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.242
You say OK, here's Sally.

00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:10.575
She puts her ball in the basket.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.330
I don't know why my pop
ups are screwing up.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.610
Anyway, then Anne comes along.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.560
Sally leaves the
room, Anne comes in,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.280
and moves Sally's ball
from the basket to the box,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.890
and closes the top of the box.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.070
Then the question is,
when Sally comes back,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.218
where will she
look for her ball?

00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:32.760
OK, where will she
look for her ball?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.550
In the basket, right.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.480
OK, if you do this very simple
question for three-year-olds,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.150
they'll say in the box.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.360
If you do it on five-year-olds,
they'll say in the basket.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.690
OK, adults say in the basket--

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.417
you have to think
for a second, right.

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:55.500
If you just kind of blurt
out the first thing that

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.583
comes to mind, you'll
behave like a three-year-old

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.620
and say in the box.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.048
But if you think for half
a second, you realize, duh,

00:17:02.048 --> 00:17:03.840
she doesn't know what
got moved to the box.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.940
She'll look where
she thinks it is--

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.930
in the basket.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.060
OK, everybody with
the program here?

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.770
OK so that's a very,
very simple task.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.849
It's the basic false
belief paradigm.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.230
And to make it
more vivid, I have

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.839
to show you the video
of Rebecca Saxe giving

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.089
this task to a bunch of
kids and talking about it.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.339
It's a delightful
video, and I'll

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.900
give you a really vivid sense of
how smart a three-year-old is,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.970
and how much they
understand, and yet

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.778
how fundamentally and
totally they fail this task--

00:17:33.778 --> 00:17:34.695
versions of this task.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.433
Come on, here we go.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.725
- The first thing
I'm going to show you

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:42.780
is a change between
age three and five,

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.180
as kids learn to understand
that somebody else can

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.530
have beliefs that are
different from their own.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.740
So I'm going to show you
a five-year-old who's

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.600
getting a standard
kind of puzzle

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.180
that we call the
false belief task.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.100
This is the first pirate.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.390
His name is Ivan.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.310
Do you know what
Pirates really like?

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.180
- What?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.400
- Pirates really like
cheese sandwiches.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.670
- Cheese.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.990
I love cheese.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.110
- Yeah, so Ivan has
this cheese sandwich.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.910
And he says yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.470
I really love cheese sandwiches.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.920
And Ivan puts his
sandwich over here

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.690
on top of the pirate chest.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.700
And Ivan says, you know what?

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.320
I need a drink with my lunch.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.360
So Ivan goes to get a drink.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.010
And while Ivan is
away, the wind comes

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.830
and it blows the sandwich
down onto the grass.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.100
And now, here comes
the other pirate.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.040
This pirate is called Joshua.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.150
And Joshua also really
loves cheese sandwiches,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.760
so Joshua has a cheese sandwich.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.920
And he says, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.980
I love cheese sandwiches.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.730
And he puts his cheese
sandwich over here,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.260
on top of the pirate chest.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.713
- So that one is his--

00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:49.630
- That one's Joshua's.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.260
- And then--

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:50.935
- That's right.

00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:53.440
- And this his is on the ground.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.010
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.362
- So he won't know
which one is his.

00:18:57.362 --> 00:18:58.570
NANCY KANWISHER: Spontaneous!

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.200
Don't even have to ask!

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.150
- Ivan comes back and he says,
I want my cheese sandwich.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.970
So which one do you think
Ivan's going to take.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.860
- I think he's going
to take that one.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.210
- Yeah, you think he's
going to take that one?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:10.930
All right, let's see.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.472
- I told you.

00:19:11.472 --> 00:19:12.730
- Oh yeah, you were right.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.865
You know--

00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:16.780
So that's a five-year-old
who clearly understands

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.490
that other people can
have false beliefs,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.900
and what the consequences
are for their actions.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.170
Now I'm going to show
you a three-year-old who

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.850
got the same puzzle.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.700
And Ivan says, I want
my cheese sandwich.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.687
Which sandwich is
he going to take?

00:19:29.687 --> 00:19:31.270
You think he's going
to take that one?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.510
Let's see what happens.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.670
Let's see what he does.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.240
Here comes Ivan, he says,
I want my cheese sandwich.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.730
And he takes this one.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.572
Oh-- why'd he take that one?

00:19:42.572 --> 00:19:46.820
- His was on the grass.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.460
- So the three-year-old
does two things differently.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.640
First, he predicts
Ivan will take

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.040
the sandwich that's really his.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.460
And second, when he sees Ivan
taking the sandwich where

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.310
he left his, where we would say
he's taking that one because he

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.170
thinks it's his,
the three-year-old

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.970
comes up with
another explanation.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.350
He's not taking
his own sandwich,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.183
because he doesn't want
to, because now it's

00:20:07.183 --> 00:20:08.090
dirty on the ground.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.630
So that's why he's taking
the other sandwich.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.170
Now, of course, development
doesn't end at 5.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.870
And we can see the
continuation of this process

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.000
of learning to think about
other people's thoughts

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.670
by upping the ante and
asking children now

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.670
not for an action prediction,
but for a moral judgment.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.460
So first, I'm going to show
you the three-year-old again.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.535
Was Ivan being mean and naughty
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:20:30.535 --> 00:20:31.280
- Yeah.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.780
- Yeah.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.570
- Should Ivan get in trouble
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.980
- Yeah.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.590
- So it's maybe not surprising--
he thinks it was mean of Ivan

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.860
to take Joshua's sandwich,
since he thinks Ivan only took

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.110
Joshua's sandwich to avoid
having to eat his own dirty

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.980
sandwich.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.110
But now, I'm going to show
you the five-year-old.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.880
Remember, the
five-year-old completely

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.460
understood why Ivan
took Joshua's sandwich.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.080
- Was Ivan being
mean and naughty

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.170
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:56.740
- Yeah.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.070
- And so it's not until age
7 that we get what looks more

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.050
like an adult response.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.120
Should Ivan get in trouble
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.150
- No, because the wind
should get in trouble.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:12.442
- The wind should get in trouble
for switching his sandwiches.

00:21:12.442 --> 00:21:13.765
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:15.640
NANCY KANWISHER:
OK, so everybody

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.980
got the idea of the
false belief tasks--

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.290
passed in the four
and five-year-olds,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.760
not in the three-year-old.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.060
And the three-year-old not only
fails to get the answer right,

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.860
but when asked why
it happened, he

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.678
comes up with a totally
different account.

00:21:28.678 --> 00:21:30.970
OK, and you can see that
three-year-old is not a dummy.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.940
Three-year-olds are smart and
can do all kinds of things,

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.060
but they don't get
this particular thing.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.855
OK, all right, what
about kids with autism?

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.560
Well, kids with autism either
failed this task altogether,

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.130
or they pass it much later
than neurotypical kids.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.390
OK, but now we've got
to figure out why.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.380
Why would a relatively high
functioning kid with autism--

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.070
say, a 7-year-old
who's got language,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.820
and who seems to
understand the question--

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.140
why would they fail this task?

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.240
Why would anybody
fail this task?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.230
There's a couple of
things going on here.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.010
The essential element of
the false belief tasks

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.160
that we're interested in is that
it requires you to attribute

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.720
thoughts to another agent.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.690
Right, that's what this
task was made to tap.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.918
But you might fail it not
just for failing to attribute

00:22:24.918 --> 00:22:25.710
thoughts correctly.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.840
You might fail it
for other reasons.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.530
You might fail it because
this task involves

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.620
this weird situation where
there's the other agent's

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.010
belief, and there's a reality,
and they're different.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.670
And that's kind of confusing.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.690
It's like representing x
and not x at the same time.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.350
Maybe that's just a particularly
generically hard cognitive

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.410
thing to do, OK.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.410
And the third possibility
is that the true state

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.380
of the world is so
salient and dominant,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.920
it may be hard to just inhibit
that true reality in order

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.130
to infer the belief--

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.635
a belief is a kind of less
visible, salient thing

00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:06.010
than the true
state of the world.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.900
And so maybe just having an
inability to inhibit dominant,

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.230
salient representations would
interfere with your ability

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.530
to do this task.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.850
So people with autism, or,
in fact, three-year-olds,

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.870
might fail for any
of these reasons.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.130
So how are we going to figure
out whether people with autism

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.510
are actually failing this task
because of their difficulty

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.462
in attributing thoughts?

00:23:30.462 --> 00:23:31.920
Well, the way to
figure that out is

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.850
to come up with a really,
really clever control task.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.260
This task was invented
by Debbie Zaitchik

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.510
when I was in graduate school.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.408
She was my office mate
in graduate school,

00:23:41.408 --> 00:23:42.700
and she came up with this task.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.280
And I said, that is
really brilliant.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.850
So we want to figure out
whether it's the belief, per se,

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.700
that's the difficulty
in attributing

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.860
the thought or the belief
to another agent that's

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.400
the crux of the problem.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.120
So in Zaitchik's
false photo task,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.120
the idea is it's a
logically isomorphic task,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.760
but it's about a physical
representation, not

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.320
a mental one.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:11.610
So what you do is you show Sally
putting her ball in the basket.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:16.850
And then you have what was then,
like, widely known to kids,

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.070
a Polaroid photograph--
a camera come along.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.140
We didn't have cell
phones back then,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.410
so it was a Polaroid camera--
takes a picture of Sally

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.440
putting her ball in
the basket, and then

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.130
Anne moves the ball from
the basket to the box.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:40.890
And then you ask the kid, where
will Sally look for her ball--

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.260
I'm sorry, where is--

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.270
sorry, then you
ask the kid, where

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.890
is the ball in the photograph?

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.500
OK, sorry, I screwed it up.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.670
Here's a belief version.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.030
The kid watches Sally and Anne.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.180
In this case, you do a
photograph version of it,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.730
so there's no--

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.920
you're not asking about
another person's beliefs.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.120
You're using a photograph.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.780
And you're showing Sally
put the ball in the basket.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.590
You take a photograph of it,
Anne moves the ball to the box.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:17.990
And then you ask in the
photograph, where's the ball?

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.410
OK, you're not asking
about a mental belief,

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.290
you're asking about a
physical representation

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.060
in the photograph.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.210
OK, so do you see how--
even though I bungled it

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.710
on the first time-- it's really
a logically isomorphic task.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.680
In both cases, you're asking
about a representation that

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.400
differs from reality, but
one's a mental representation.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.590
That's where the kids
with autism fail the task.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.930
This is the physical
representation.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.920
Kids with ASD fail the
false belief task, not

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.410
the false photo task.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.390
And that rules out
these other accounts,

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.270
because in both cases,
there's a representation that

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.260
differs from reality.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.780
You have the x and not
x challenge-- right,

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.880
that's true of both of these.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.190
And in both cases,
the true state

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.460
is kind of more dominant than
the representational state

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.710
in the belief, or the photo.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.970
And yet, they have a problem
with the belief version,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.950
not with the photograph
version, suggesting

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.493
that this is the correct
account of why they fail.

00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:19.160
That make sense?

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.720
Was there a question?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.510
Yeah-- OK.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.730
So all of that is
consistent with the idea

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.670
that attributing
thoughts to another agent

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.640
is a special, distinctive
thing that can be--

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.400
that's what I just said.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.640
So we have evidence that
attributing thoughts is

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.530
a distinct domain of cognition.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.810
It's just not part of
your generic ability

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.830
to think about anything.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.950
And we see that from the fact
that typical children have

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.890
this very systematic
developmental time

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.630
course, where they
get this at age five,

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.370
they don't get it at age three.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.710
And we see it from
the selective loss

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.730
of this ability in
kids with autism,

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.850
that they get the false belief
task way later than they

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.380
get the false photograph task.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.550
Was there a question here?

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.970
AUDIENCE: So the kids are never
asked what does Anne perceive.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.430
That question then comes
up in the FP task--

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.358
in the false photograph task?

00:27:13.358 --> 00:27:14.900
NANCY KANWISHER:
I'm sure people have

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.760
done versions of that
task, but tell me

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.340
what you're getting at here.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.780
AUDIENCE: I just want to know
whether-- to do an accurate

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.900
comparison, I would assume
that the final question remains

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.630
the same.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.210
So I would ask the kid, what do
you think Anne perceives given

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.860
the change in the stimulus.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.030
And then the kid responds, given
the new material, as to what

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.690
the answer--

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.040
NANCY KANWISHER: You're trying
to get a tighter control

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.237
to the false photo task.

00:27:38.237 --> 00:27:39.320
AUDIENCE: Very much, yeah.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.320
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
instead of where will she

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.860
look for the ball-- yeah.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.020
But it's not really
about what she perceives.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.750
It's about where she
thinks the ball is.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.380
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.840
NANCY KANWISHER: And so
the false belief tasks

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.862
have been done every
which way, from where

00:27:53.862 --> 00:27:55.820
does Sally think the ball
is, to where will she

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.570
look for the ball.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.800
And you get the same
answer in all of those.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.293
So I think that's closer to,
where is it in the-- where

00:28:02.293 --> 00:28:03.710
is it in the
photograph is really,

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.480
where does she think it is?

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.143
That's the parallel.

00:28:07.143 --> 00:28:09.560
Yeah, because she's not still
perceiving it at that point.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.643
OK, so that's
behavioral evidence

00:28:14.643 --> 00:28:16.310
to suggest that there's
really something

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.160
different about inferring
another person's thoughts

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.890
and beliefs than there is
from the rest of cognition--

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.930
the distinctive
developmental time

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.380
course and this kind of
selective deficit in autism.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.990
So what can we learn
from functional MRI?

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.670
Is there a special
part of the brain

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.610
for making these inferences
about other agents, thoughts,

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.390
and beliefs.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.830
OK, so Rebecca and I did
this experiment 100 years ago

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.570
where we scanned
people while they

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.870
were doing simple verbal tasks.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.510
So we wrote false
belief stories,

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.670
and sort of false
photo stories--

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.920
generalized-- and
we scanned people

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.930
while they lay in the
scanner and just read

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.510
these simple descriptions
and answered basic questions.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.040
So you can try this right now.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.800
Here's a false belief story.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.130
You read-- Susie parked her
sports car in the driveway

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.420
in the middle of the night.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.220
Nathan moved her
car into the garage

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.350
to make room for his minivan.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.750
Susie woke up early
in the morning.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.750
Susie expects to see
in the driveway--

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.890
a sports car or a minivan?

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.390
Yes.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.270
Sports car, duh.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.350
Right, exactly.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.990
What she thinks is
there, not what is there.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.010
The control experiment that--
we wrote many, many of these--

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.260
a volcano erupted on
this Caribbean island

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.220
three months ago.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.590
Barren lava rock is
all that remains.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:41.180
Satellite photos show the island
as it was before the eruption.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.940
In the photos, the island is
covered in rock or vegetation,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.440
right.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.980
OK, so here again, it's just
like Debbie Zaitchik's ASD

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.700
control here.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.940
It's-- you're asking about a
representation in the satellite

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.440
photo that's no longer
true of reality.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.180
And you have to
distinguish the two.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.570
So we scan people just
doing these tasks.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.890
OK, and if you look in a
whole brain group analysis

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.802
that I was much dissing before,
but that's a good first step,

00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:13.010
you see-- here's a slice
through the brain like this.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.750
You see a bunch
of hot spots that

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.470
respond more when you do
these tasks than those tasks.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.270
OK, and there's a
bunch of these regions.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.888
Deep down in the middle of
the prefrontal cortex here

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:28.430
that you can see in
a slice like that

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.110
here is a region called MPFC
for medial prefrontal cortex.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.800
It does all kinds of
interesting things,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.250
and it will get mostly short
shrift in this lecture.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.990
It activates in this task--

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:43.040
for reasons you'll see in a
minute, activates in this task.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.300
Oh god, pop ups have
a mind of their own.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.250
But here's another
region, the right TPJ--

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.970
TPJ stands for
temporoparietal junction.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.560
So in me, if my temporal
lobe is going down here,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.560
my parietal lobe is here,
frontal lobe is there.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.590
Temporoparietal junction is
somewhere right around there.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.890
OK-- everybody oriented?

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:08.000
And if we look at that region,
shown symbolically here, what

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.060
you see in the time
course of response

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.550
in that region doing
this task, is here's

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.560
what happens in that region.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.450
This is time here--
many seconds,

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.410
as they read and
answer that task.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.980
And here's what happens
when they read and answer

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.070
the false photo task-- so false
belief task, false photo task.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.810
That just shows you the
same thing's activation.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.540
You can see it evolve over time.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:36.350
OK, so what happens
in the MPFC region--

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.558
oh god, why is
this not happening.

00:31:40.558 --> 00:31:41.350
Is that showing up?

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.450
Oh, there it is, OK.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.600
Right-- in the MPFC region,
you see a similar thing.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.528
You get a response
below baseline here.

00:31:49.528 --> 00:31:51.070
We'll talk about
that-- what it means

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.630
to have a response
below baseline

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.790
in some conditions
in the next lecture.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.530
It's actually not
all that mysterious.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.410
It just means that baseline,
remember, is usually

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.947
lying in the scanner staring at
a dot-- going dum dee dum dee

00:32:02.947 --> 00:32:04.780
dum-- or whatever you
do when you're staring

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.790
at a dot in the scanner.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.150
And the key point for
now is just that you also

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.270
see a higher response to
the belief than photo case.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.915
OK, so what's going
on in these regions?

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.990
This activation,
this higher response,

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.820
to the belief than photo case--

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.430
even though I was touting what
a brilliant control condition

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.770
the false photo task is--

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.860
but it's still open to a bunch
of different possibilities.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.710
OK, so those activations
could be just thinking

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.820
about a person.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.780
After all, our false belief
stories all involve people,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.300
and our false photo
stories did not.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.370
So maybe this isn't
about beliefs per se,

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.860
it's just about thinking
about people in general--

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.570
any aspect of people.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:58.350
OK, or it could be
any mental inference

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:03.150
we make about the internal,
invisible states of a person.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:08.190
OK-- anything that might
be going on in their head.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.250
Or it might be, particularly,
attributing thoughts

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.370
and desires to the person.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.510
OK, so how are we going
to unconfound these--

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.830
with a new experiment
and some new conditions.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.450
So here's a new condition
that refers just to a person,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.850
not about their internal
invisible states,

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.040
or their thoughts or desires.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.380
Subjects just read
simple stories like--

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.142
I see what's happening.

00:33:36.142 --> 00:33:37.850
It's not showing--
it's showing something

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.850
different on the screen from
what's on my slide here.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.940
I have no idea why.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.750
But anyway, that's why I
keep wondering what's there

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.700
and what's not.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.510
OK, so in the external
case, in this condition,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.260
you lie in the scanner
and you read stuff,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.340
like, Andrew just
had a growth spurt,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.400
so he was gangly
and rather awkward.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.300
Like most teenagers, he had bad
skin and bad taste in clothes.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.180
He wore mostly baggy
jeans and flannel shirts.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.700
OK, so it's not riveting,
but it's not boring either.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.950
You read a bunch of these,
they're interesting enough.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.409
OK-- but no mental states
there, just outward appearance.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:15.590
OK the next condition
refers directly

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.110
to the person's thoughts--

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.360
Nicky knew that his sister's
flight from San Francisco

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.830
was delayed 10 hours.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.650
Only one flight was
delayed so much that night,

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.699
so when he got to the airport,
he knew what flight was hers.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.550
OK, not even that
interesting, but it's

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.580
talking about what he inferred,
what he knew-- beliefs.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.670
OK, but there's
a third condition

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.190
that refers to an
internal state,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.450
but not a thought or a belief.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.181
It refers to a visceral state.

00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:47.639
Sheila skipped breakfast because
she was late for the train

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.306
to her mother's.

00:34:48.306 --> 00:34:50.880
By the time she got off the
train, she was starving.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.870
Her stomach was rumbling and
she could smell food everywhere.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.489
OK, so this case is interesting.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.480
It's vivid.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.600
It refers to a mental
state, but not a thought.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.390
It's a physical state, hunger.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.930
OK, I mean it's a
mental representation

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.740
of a bodily sensation.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.650
OK, everybody get
the distinction

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.520
between internal thoughts
and feelings, sensations?

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.140
OK, so this contrast
is consistent with any

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.370
of these hypotheses.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.890
And we're going to test those
hypotheses with these three

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.300
conditions.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.605
OK, so here are the
three hypotheses

00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:31.980
we just described here, and
here are the three conditions

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.000
I just gave.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.890
And I want you guys
to tell me what

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.880
we're going to predict that
we will see in the right TPJ

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.805
according to each hypothesis--

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.180
namely, which of
these conditions

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.890
will produce a high
response, and which

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.410
will produce a low response.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.680
OK, so let's start
with this case--

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.350
on the hypothesis
that the right TPJ

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.680
responds whenever you're
reading about a person,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.993
what are we going to find?

00:35:56.993 --> 00:35:58.410
Which of these
conditions is going

00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.535
to produce a high response?

00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:02.970
AUDIENCE: All of them?

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.010
NANCY KANWISHER: All of
them, yeah, absolutely.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.110
So that's the prediction
here-- all of them.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:12.420
OK, what about if it's
interested in internal bodily

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:17.355
sensations, or actually, in
any internal mental states?

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.800
The last two, absolutely--
both the visceral case

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.790
and the thoughts case.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.500
Sorry-- that cell and that cell.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.620
OK, and what about
if it's specifically

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.400
about attributing
thoughts to another agent.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.050
Just the last one, right--

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.430
OK, very good.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.420
So what do we see?

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.780
So first of all, here's
just a localizer task.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.047
Always nice to look at your
localizer and make sure

00:36:42.047 --> 00:36:42.630
it worked out.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.383
So this is a response of
the right TPJ to the belief

00:36:45.383 --> 00:36:47.550
and photo condition, just
like I showed you before--

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.320
higher when you do the belief
task than the photo task.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.380
OK, just a reality check--

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.540
key question, what
is the response

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.030
of the right TPJ in that main
experiment with the three

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.720
conditions we just described?

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.910
And here's what it does.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.550
It's high only in the
thought condition,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.760
only when you're reading about,
thinking about another person's

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.770
thoughts.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.780
And that's significantly
higher than

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:19.530
either the external properties
or the visceral states.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.150
And those two, even
though it looks

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.380
like there's a
little bit of a trend

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.000
that visceral is
higher than external,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.110
that's not significant.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.180
Yeah?

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.190
AUDIENCE: On the
previous slide, is it,

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.950
like, thoughts and/or desires?

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.170
So like, why can't--

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.380
like, I was just confused
about the example

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.290
for the visceral case, if
your smelling food everywhere.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.088
Like, couldn't that
fall under it--

00:37:42.088 --> 00:37:43.630
NANCY KANWISHER:
That's a good point.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.580
Yes, it could.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.830
Yes, you could infer a desire
in that case, absolutely.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.650
Yeah, that's right.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.900
So yeah, that's a good point.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.972
It's intended to just identify
the vivid, visceral state.

00:37:56.972 --> 00:37:58.680
And it's probably hard
to do that with it

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.160
without invoking some
kind of desires here.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.130
Yeah, I would consider
it a confound for that,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.480
for that particular example.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.370
I'm guessing it was
not so for the others.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.720
In fact, it sort of
couldn't have been,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.780
given the way this
came out, right?

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.590
But good point.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.240
OK, so--

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.720
OK, so-- and if you
do a whole group

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.790
analysis, the whole
brain, and you

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.880
say what bits do you get
in a contrast of reasoning

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.790
about another person's
thoughts versus their external

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.850
appearance, or their
visceral states,

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.290
their bodily sensations?

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.280
You get the right TPJ again.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.110
OK, so everybody got this?

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.670
This suggests that the right
TPJ is extremely specifically

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.950
interested in inferring
another person's thoughts,

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.150
not even just their
bodily sensations.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.140
So it's not all mental
states of another person

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.208
that engage this region.

00:38:57.208 --> 00:38:58.750
I mean, I find this
quite remarkable,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.370
because that's so specific.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.040
Before you hear about
this, you think, OK,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.742
thinking about another person's
thirst or hunger or pain,

00:39:05.742 --> 00:39:08.200
is that really different than
thinking about their beliefs?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.890
But oh yes, it's different.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.390
Right?

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.220
The TPJ does believe it's not
thirst and hunger and pain.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:13.720
Yes?

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.055
AUDIENCE: What about
your own thoughts and--

00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:18.430
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, so there's

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.970
a whole literature on this.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:24.040
And I think if you--

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.920
OK, so first of all, we need
to get the levels straight.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.813
When you're just
thinking, you're

00:39:28.813 --> 00:39:29.980
not thinking about thinking.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.730
You're just thinking,
right, so you're not

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.460
engaging this region.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.668
So when we're talking
about thoughts,

00:39:35.668 --> 00:39:37.960
we're talking about you
thinking about another person's

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.870
thoughts.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.780
So the parallel
would be thinking

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.970
about your own thoughts, right.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.350
So I think--

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.722
I can't tell you exactly what
the literature is on this,

00:39:47.722 --> 00:39:49.180
I'm sure there's
a few experiments.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.555
But I think what
you'd have to do

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:54.190
is adopt that kind
of meta perspective

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.500
on yourself, right--

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.260
a lot of our thinking
is sort of thinking

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.105
about thinking, but not in a
very explicit, separable way.

00:40:03.105 --> 00:40:04.480
I'm not being very
clear on this,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:11.830
but I think if you ask
people for example,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.110
when you saw this surprising
event, whatever it is--

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.520
you make something up--

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.400
what were you thinking?

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.478
You might engage that region.

00:40:20.478 --> 00:40:23.020
I realize I'm not totally sure
if there's literature on this.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.680
Heather, is there?

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.055
There must be
literature on this.

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:30.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.946
Yeah.

00:40:30.946 --> 00:40:37.925
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:37.925 --> 00:40:40.130
You get MPFC for that, yeah.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.170
Or go ahead--

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:51.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.680
AUDIENCE: --and very, it's
kind of, like, intricate--

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.220
[INAUDIBLE] --it will
two networks that are--

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.490
NANCY KANWISHER: But not just
rTPJ, right, rTPJ and other

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:03.450
regions.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:07.440
Yeah, so you could get
some rTPJ when answering

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.060
those kinds of questions.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:12.926
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh-huh.

00:41:12.926 --> 00:41:15.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.720
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, so you
get something in the vicinity.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.030
I'm just trying to get--

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.480
Right, but the
other part of this

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.970
is, I bet you have to do
something quite explicit

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.720
to do that, because
in some sense,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.990
we're thinking about
our own thoughts

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.790
kind of implicitly
a lot of the time.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.040
Right, so I'm guessing
that it's when

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.320
you ask about it explicitly.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
forget the details of--

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.192
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:42.192 --> 00:41:43.150
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.726
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.726 --> 00:41:45.684
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:41:45.684 --> 00:41:47.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.998
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.430
OK, anyway, good question.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.680
I'm sorry, I don't have a
totally adequate answer yet.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.347
I'm guessing the
literature doesn't have

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.820
a totally adequate answer yet.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:05.700
OK, all right, so
recall that I mentioned

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.210
that the contrast between
doing the false belief

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:13.140
task versus the false photo
task gets not just the rTPJ,

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.750
it also gets this
medial frontal region.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.640
OK, and that medial
frontal region

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.060
responds more to the belief
than photograph task, like this.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.440
What does it do in this
split between thoughts,

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.670
visceral thinking about
other people's thoughts,

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:31.950
their visceral states, and
their external appearance?

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.600
It doesn't care.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.710
OK, so there's a real division
between these different brain

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.680
regions that are engaged when
you do the false belief task.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.280
The rTPJ is very
specifically interested in--

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.720
very specifically
engaged when you

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.370
think about another
person's thoughts,

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.040
not when you think about
their bodily sensations.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.280
The medial prefrontal region
is engaged in all three

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.290
of these conditions.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:01.510
OK, so what it looks like
is that of these three

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.500
hypotheses, any time you
think about another person,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.905
that's true of the MPFC.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:14.170
Whereas the right TPJ
responds specifically

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.410
when you attribute thoughts
and desires to another person.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.910
OK?

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.960
OK, now you may have been
wondering about the fact

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.300
that all of these
experiments are using words.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.700
It's kind of not, like,
normal social cognition.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.950
You're reading about
all this stuff.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.940
And if these regions
were really doing

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.397
what we're claiming
they're doing,

00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:39.480
we should be able to find
them in other situations

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.170
where you make inferences
about other agents' beliefs.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.090
So in more recent
experiments, they've

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.790
been showing Pixar movies
to subjects in the scanner.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.750
So you can just watch
yourself make a few inferences

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.070
about the agent's beliefs.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.920
Imagine you're watching
this in the scanner,

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.130
and just let's just do a little
bit of it to get the gist.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.070
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:08.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.345
No words, it's a key.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.900
OK, so there's a whole little
microcosm of mental states

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.860
here.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.830
In other parts of this same
six minute Pixar movie,

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.320
there's very vivid
bodily sensations.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.040
There's a porcupine
who inflicts real pain

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.280
with porcupine quills,
so there's bodily states,

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.520
and inferences
about bodily states,

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.090
and inferences about
mental states that go on.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:42.870
And by showing this movie
to subjects in the scanner,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.620
and then labeling which parts
of the movie require the viewer

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.840
to make inferences about
the thoughts and beliefs

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.560
of the protagonists, and which
require them to make inferences

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.280
about bodily sensations--
like, usually pain--

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.390
if you do that contrast,
you find the same set

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:05.430
of regions, the rTPJ and
its left hemisphere bit,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.500
and you find some
medial prefrontal stuff,

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.750
and you find some other stuff.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.410
OK, so what does that mean?

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.730
That means that you don't need
words to identify this region.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.490
If you induce the same
cognitive processes just

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.940
from watching a
wordless movie, you

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.420
show the same
selective activations.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.880
And that's cool,
because it tells us

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.970
that this is not about some
kind of verbal reasoning.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.910
It's really about the kind
of deeper cognitive process,

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.500
whether you do it
based on a movie,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.710
or based on a
bunch of sentences.

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.510
And that's a powerful
generalization.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:44.610
We like imaging results,
where the result generalizes

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.200
across very different
kinds of tasks.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.750
And this really
strengthens the evidence

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.300
that this is really what's
going on in this region.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.930
And it also means you can
look for this region in kids.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.660
OK, and I didn't manage to
fit that into this lecture,

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.820
but there's a whole
other research enterprise

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.870
where, in Rebecca's lab,
they've been scanning kids

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.090
watching this Pixar
movie, and asking

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.610
how that region develops.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.940
And they find that, actually,
the region continues

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.610
to develop even after age four.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.840
It continues to develop.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.870
And what happens is it
doesn't so much get bigger

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:20.820
as it gets more selective.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:26.700
In the younger kids you
get activation, both for--

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.590
well, it's just less selective.

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:31.240
Anyway, so this
shows generalization.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.520
So now we've shown
that we see the rTPJ is

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.250
selective for thinking about
other people's thoughts.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.020
We see that with false photo--

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.690
false belief versus
false photo contrast.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.470
We see that it's
highly specific.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.410
It's not just any thoughts
you have about another person.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.320
And we see it generalizes
to Pixar movies.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:55.800
OK, so let's consider now
moral reasoning as a test

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.890
case for theory of mind.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.530
Why moral reasoning?

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.810
Well, if you think
about it, reasoning

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.750
about what's a morally
acceptable or unacceptable

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:12.210
action on the part of another
person is all about what

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.780
the person intended
and what they knew.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.270
OK, so intent is
very fundamental.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.780
It's built into
the legal system.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.930
Think about the
difference between murder

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.640
and manslaughter.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.740
Right, they both involve
killing another person,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.530
but one is with intent, and
the other is accidental.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:32.070
And our common moral
reasoning and our legal system

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.260
cares deeply about
that difference.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.950
So for example, I'm going to
give you a moral reasoning

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.470
task, and just think about this.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:47.280
And your task is going to be to
decide how morally permissible

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.770
is the action described here--

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.360
Grace's action in particular.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.460
OK, so Grace and her
friend are taking

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.143
a tour of a chemical plant.

00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:57.060
And when Grace goes over
to the coffee machine

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.640
to pour some coffee,
Grace's friend

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.860
asks for some sugar in hers.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.640
And there's white powder in
a container by the coffee.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.110
The plot thickens.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.870
The white powder is a very
toxic substance left behind

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.390
by a scientist, and
therefore, it's deadly

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.230
when ingested in any form--

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:20.640
versus-- but the container
is labeled sugar,

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.790
so Grace believes that the
white powder by the coffee

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.810
is sugar left by
the kitchen staff.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.050
So grace puts the substance
in her friend's coffee,

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.870
and her friend drinks
the coffee and dies.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:36.470
Now, your question is
how morally permissible

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.620
was Grace's action,
on a scale from one,

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.060
to totally not OK, morally
forbidden, to seven, morally

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.140
permissible.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.810
OK, so think about
that on a scale,

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:49.860
and write down your number
on a piece of paper.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.640
You don't have to divulge it.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.130
OK, everybody got the question?

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.570
Everybody decided, more or less?

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.590
OK, write down your number.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.670
Now, consider a slightly
different case--

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.690
slightly, but crucially
different case--

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.610
this case is known as
the accidental harm case.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:16.960
Now consider the
case where instead--

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:22.190
OK, instead of being labeled
sugar, you get the same story,

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.550
but now the container
is labeled toxic.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:28.420
So Grace believes that the white
powder is a toxic substance

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.730
left behind by a scientist.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.340
Nonetheless, she
puts the substance

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.010
in her friend's coffee and
their friend drinks a coffee

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.910
and dies.

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.640
Now, consider how
morally permissible

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:45.550
is Grace's action, from one,
to totally not OK, to seven,

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.560
morally permissible.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.865
And write down your number.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.790
OK, how many people gave
a lower number-- that is,

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:01.110
more morally forbidden for the
second one than the first one.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:05.400
OK, if you didn't, you probably
weren't paying attention.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.090
OK, so you can see
that it's the crux

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.070
of the matter what
Grace believed

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:12.900
when she did the action.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.030
OK, that's why we're talking
about moral reasoning

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.850
here as a test case
of theory of mind,

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:20.610
because what the agent knew
at the time of the action

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.340
is of the essence in thinking
about the moral status

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.690
of their action.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.550
OK, everybody got that--

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.523
OK, so this is a
powerful test case.

00:50:28.523 --> 00:50:30.690
And notice that-- also in
the clip that I showed you

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:33.660
from Rebecca's Ted
Talk, she showed

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:39.930
that kids' ability to use an
agent's knowledge in doing what

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.110
you guys just did, that
kicks in a little bit later

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.150
than the standard
false belief task.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:49.110
So sometime after they get the
basic idea of false belief,

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:50.160
they start to apply.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.880
It takes a while to kick
in in this other case.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.140
OK, so this is known as
intentional harm as opposed

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.090
to accidental harm.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:03.450
OK-- it's just the
terminology in the field.

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:08.250
OK, so what do you think
will happen in autism?

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:13.710
If we ask people with
autism these two questions--

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.440
and what do you think
will happen if we

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.440
apply TMS to the right TPJ?

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.980
It's right out there on
the lateral surface, just

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.000
asking for it.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.220
So it's a totally
doable experiment.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.785
It's been done, what
do you think happens?

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.590
OK, let's take the
case with autism.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.350
How do you think
people with autism

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.970
will respond to
these two questions?

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.350
The same as you guys did?

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.950
Yeah-- yes, Shardoul.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.890
AUDIENCE: Probably the
average distance between--

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.890
the average distance between how
bad they think the second one

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.650
would be less than
the first one--

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.900
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes, exactly.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.400
Why?

00:51:58.402 --> 00:51:59.860
AUDIENCE: Because
they might not be

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.000
able to make the
distinction between Grace

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.250
knowing that the
container was toxic

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:09.610
versus the container
being labeled toxic.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.830
Like, both then, would
be confounded with just

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.733
like truth and consequence.

00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:15.400
NANCY KANWISHER:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.400
Did everybody get that--

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.560
share that intuition?

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.520
To the extent that autism
is a particular deficit

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.570
in understanding what another
person knows or believes,

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.880
that's the only difference
between these two cases.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.090
To the extent that you have
difficulty representing that,

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:32.860
you will have less
of a difference

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.900
in your moral judgment
about these two things,

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.450
because you have a hard time
representing that person's

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.350
knowledge.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:41.470
It's not that autism is a
deficit in moral reasoning.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:44.197
It's that moral
reasoning entails

00:52:44.197 --> 00:52:46.780
thinking about other-- at least
these cases, not all of them--

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.780
but these cases involve thinking
about other people's thoughts

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.250
and taking them into account.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.260
And to the extent that
that's difficult for you,

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.190
you will make less of a
distinction, exactly--

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.690
right.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.070
Yeah, was there a
question back there?

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:57.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:57.945 --> 00:53:00.520
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, OK.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.310
OK, what do you
think will happen

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:07.508
if you zap the rTPJ
with TMS while subjects

00:53:07.508 --> 00:53:08.425
are doing these tasks?

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.095
Yeah?

00:53:14.095 --> 00:53:14.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:15.603
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah?

00:53:15.603 --> 00:53:16.728
AUDIENCE: They'd be, like--

00:53:16.728 --> 00:53:18.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:19.850
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:20.990
That's the prediction.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.530
If the rTPJ is the main bit
that's doing the inference

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.320
about-- it's representing
the beliefs of others,

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:32.420
then if you zap it, you
might change people's moral

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.470
inferences--

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.280
moral judgments.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.640
That's pretty wild.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.380
That's what happens.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.470
Zap the rTPJ, and they
make a smaller distinction

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.910
between accidental harm
and intentional harm.

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:49.770
OK, so both of those
things are true.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.890
I won't drag you through all
the details of the experiments.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.710
But the basic findings from
this whole line of work

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:59.520
show that, first of
all, neurotypical people

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.910
agree, as you guys did, that
accidental harm is more morally

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.890
permissible than
intentional harm.

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:10.620
OK, and people with
autism give less

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.370
forgiveness for accidental harm
compared to intentional harm

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.750
than neurotypicals.

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.890
OK-- just because that ability
to represent the key knowledge

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.030
that tells you
it's accidental is

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.280
something they're not good at.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.050
What is the role of the rTPJ?

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.728
The data show that forgiveness
for accidental harms--

00:54:31.728 --> 00:54:33.270
first of all, I left
this out before,

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.330
is correlated in
neurotypicals with activation

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.530
of the right TPJ
during moral judgment.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.440
So if you just measure
across a whole bunch

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.350
of those moral judgment
problems how strongly activated

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.740
was your rTPJ as you
read that problem, that's

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.640
correlated with your
ability to forgive somebody

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.470
for accidentally
harming someone,

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.920
again showing that there's
a relationship between your

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.950
representing the thoughts
and beliefs of another person

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:03.540
and your using that information
to exonerate them from harm

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.380
they didn't intend.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:04.880
Yeah?

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.250
AUDIENCE: For someone with
autism syndrome, are they--

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.760
is it different for thoughts
versus external actions

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.920
of the things?

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.630
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, so first of all,

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.320
I'm treating autism
very superficially here.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.680
It's an extremely
heterogeneous thing

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:26.160
that varies not just along
a spectrum, you know,

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.800
which it clearly does, but
probably along many spectra,

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.600
and is highly heterogeneous.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:36.120
So these experiments are just
done in high functioning adults

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.500
who are--

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.220
totally pass false
belief tasks--

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.220
they pass them later in life,
but they get to-- otherwise,

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.440
you can't test them on
these kinds of experiments.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.270
And the effects
are quite subtle.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:50.850
They're just a slightly
lesser difference

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:52.555
between accidental
and intentional harm.

00:55:52.555 --> 00:55:54.930
OK, so just to clarify that,
which I probably should have

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:55.430
said.

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:58.350
But your question
is, are the deficits

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:00.552
in autism specific to
thinking about thoughts

00:56:00.552 --> 00:56:02.010
rather than thinking
about actions?

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.380
This is ongoing work,
but a lot of research

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.190
has shown that it is more
specific to thoughts,

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.650
and that a lot of the
stuff you read about just

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.290
basic perceptual difficulties--

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:21.540
I mean, most studies find
that people with autism

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.480
are a little bit worse
at face recognition,

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.640
but not much worse.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.300
In tasks asking about
goals of actions,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.510
like reaching for objects--
what is that person's intention?

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.220
Mostly, they don't find
a deficit in autism.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.780
So the perceptual--
basic seeing people

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:44.100
and seeing what they're
doing is much less impaired.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.110
That's what the current
literature suggests.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:47.880
There's always the
worry that we're not

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.390
asking in the right way, or
testing in the right way.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.840
And the literature is highly
inconsistent from one study

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.410
to the next.

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.890
I used to work on autism and I
just couldn't stand it anymore,

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:00.540
because every time
a study's done,

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.430
it gets the opposite
of the previous study.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.800
I think as a population--
so heterogeneous.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.930
But from a gloss, it
looks like there's

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.340
more of a deficit in the
inferences about thoughts

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.590
than inferences about actions.

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:10.890
Yeah?

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.360
AUDIENCE: I just
want to clarify.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.180
So the autistic subjects
are also explicitly told

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.082
that Grace believes--

00:57:17.082 --> 00:57:17.790
blah, blah, blah.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:18.420
Yes?

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.920
It's explicit--

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.525
NANCY KANWISHER: No, it's
exactly what I gave here.

00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:26.400
Yeah, no Grace believes--
yeah, you're right.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.330
Grace believes.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:27.960
Yes--

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.870
AUDIENCE: Explicitly being--
and in spite of that, it's--

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:31.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.710
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yep, yeah, yeah.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:36.960
And so I think you can think
of this as a subtle case.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.830
These are people who pass the
explicit false belief task.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.690
But like the 7-year-old
kids, there's

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.405
one thing if you're asked--
what does this person believe,

00:57:45.405 --> 00:57:47.280
and another if you're
asked a moral reasoning

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.830
task for which you have
to realize to bring

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.940
the belief into account.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.615
It takes more of your
own kind of active--

00:57:54.615 --> 00:57:55.740
was there another question?

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.000
AUDIENCE: What if you ask--

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.250
like, instead of Grace,
what if you say it's you?

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:00.500
NANCY KANWISHER: What if what?

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.293
AUDIENCE: You ask
them about themselves.

00:58:03.293 --> 00:58:04.710
So you and your
friends are taking

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:06.543
a tour of the chemical
plants, and give them

00:58:06.543 --> 00:58:07.590
the exact same scenario.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:08.971
Would that be any different?

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.000
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.380
It's like the question
about to what--

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:15.880
sorry--

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.340
AUDIENCE: What was the question?

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.810
NANCY KANWISHER: Question
is, suppose you ask people

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:21.120
with autism this same question,
but it's not about Grace.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.750
It's about you.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.725
You do all of this.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.690
I'm not sure.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:26.287
Good question.

00:58:26.287 --> 00:58:27.870
Probably, somebody
has looked at that.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:28.370
Yeah.

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:31.590
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if
you answered already, but do

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:33.420
people with autism
have something

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.968
different in their rTPJ?

00:58:34.968 --> 00:58:36.510
NANCY KANWISHER:
We're getting there.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.550
You should absolutely
be wondering that,

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:39.360
and I haven't yet.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.660
And we're getting there.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.490
Good that you ask.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.323
In fact, that's probably
my very next slide.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.270
OK, so causal role--

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.900
we showed the causal role of the
rTPJ in neurotypical subjects,

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.280
you zap the rTPJ and you
slightly reduce the difference

00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.210
in moral permissibility
of the accidental harms

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.890
and the intentional harms.

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.320
OK, so all of these
findings suggest

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.510
that the rTPJ is
causally engaged

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.970
in understanding the difference
between intentional and

00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:13.020
accidental actions, and
that ability is specifically

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.510
disrupted and autism, All.

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:17.940
Of which leads to the
natural prediction

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.600
that Gisella just made
about the rTPJ in autism.

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.610
So what do you think?

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:25.985
Is the rTPJ affected in autism?

00:59:25.985 --> 00:59:27.360
How many-- raise
your hand if you

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.818
think there's going
to be something

00:59:28.818 --> 00:59:34.120
different in the rTPJ autism
versus typical subjects.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.870
OK, raise your hand if
you think there isn't.

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:40.570
Not sure-- OK, well,
you're sort of both right

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:41.500
in different ways.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:49.090
OK, so the answer is this--
so in Rebecca Saxe's lab,

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:52.120
they did a study with
a really large number

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.120
of typical subjects.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.130
It's-- because of this
heterogeneity in the autism

00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:59.740
population, it's really hard
to get a stable result you can

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.970
believe.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.660
And it helps to have
a really large--

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.600
it's hard to get
enough autism subjects,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.250
so we try and we get
as many as we can.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.250
And the most you ever get
in a study around here

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.530
is 20, 30, and that's
a big struggle.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:14.560
But it helps to have a really
large neurotypical control

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.510
population to reduce
your error bars

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:19.060
on what the neurotypical
population shows.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.610
So this study is probably
the biggest that's been done.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:26.650
They had 31 high functioning
people with autism and 462

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.720
neurotypical individuals.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.630
They didn't just go run
400 new subjects for this.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.700
When you run that
localizer task,

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.330
you've got it in
every study you run.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:38.110
And so then you can take all
those localizer tasks across

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.330
hundreds of subjects-- so--

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:44.200
and so what they find is,
both if you look at regions

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.930
of interest analysis,
like find rTPJ,

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:50.360
and if you do a whole
brain group analysis,

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.078
you find no differences
between people with autism--

01:00:55.078 --> 01:00:56.620
high functioning
people with autism--

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.400
and typical subjects in the
size, location, or response

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.195
magnitude of the rTPJ.

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:10.990
OK-- when people do
theory of mind tasks.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.790
So you should be surprised.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:13.930
Everyone is surprised.

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.340
You all made the prediction.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.280
Everyone else made
the prediction too.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.405
And that's pretty bizarre.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.120
But does that mean that the
rTPJ is not affected in ASD?

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240
Shardoul?

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.160
AUDIENCE: If we feed it-- the
information from the rTPJ is

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.913
not used by other
parts of the brain to--

01:01:39.913 --> 01:01:40.740
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.532
NANCY KANWISHER: That's
a great hypothesis.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.210
Maybe the information
is in there,

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.100
and it's some kind of
a disconnection thing,

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:50.210
and so it can't be accessed
by other processes.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.440
Right, absolutely.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.700
What's another hypothesis?

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.210
Yeah, Isabelle?

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.727
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:57.727 --> 01:01:58.685
NANCY KANWISHER: Sorry?

01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:00.970
AUDIENCE: It's being processed
in a different order?

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:01.840
NANCY KANWISHER: In
a different order.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.829
What do you mean?

01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:06.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.430
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, but then we'd

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:10.847
have to think about how the
different temporal order would

01:02:10.847 --> 01:02:13.230
lead to the different
behavioral outcomes.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.870
Right, it might.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.420
Yeah, David.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.110
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's given a
different priority, so, like,

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:24.080
while you're processing
there, I'm not being--

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.702
[INAUDIBLE] --the person
itself [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.290
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
OK, so it might be there,

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.910
but less salient
or less important.

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:38.610
But how is that going to account
for the lack of a difference

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.010
between the ASDs and typicals.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:45.360
Remember, you run your basic
false belief versus false photo

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.390
contrast, and you find the rTPJ.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.840
And surprisingly, even in
this fairly large sample,

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.590
it looks the same in size,
location, and response

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.660
magnitude in the ASDs
and in the typicals.

01:03:00.287 --> 01:03:01.370
Now, I left something out.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.520
This is high functioning
adult ASDs who can now

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.948
pass the false belief task.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.490
Right, that's crucial,
because that's

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:08.780
the task you're
doing in the scanner.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.320
If they don't
understand the task,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.680
there's no point scanning
them kind of going, huh, what?

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.650
Right, so these are people
who are very high functioning.

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:17.180
And they can totally
do the task--

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.510
right, otherwise you
can't run the experiment.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:23.550
So-- yes?

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.050
AUDIENCE: What are the major
differences that you're finding

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:29.475
then, if it informs [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:31.600
NANCY KANWISHER: Well,
that's a very good question.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.940
That's another reason that
I stopped working on autism.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.530
There's a whole
battery that you run

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:42.310
to try to establish that these
people, officially, really,

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.640
for the purposes of scientific
study, count as having autism.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.590
And these people,
really, officially don't.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.708
At MIT, you need to run
those studies on everyone,

01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:51.250
because some of your
control subjects

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:52.360
end up in the other group.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.500
And so those are a whole
kind of battery of things,

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.980
from involving an hour long
interview with a trained

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.370
person who tallies things like
how much eye contact is made,

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:09.880
and what kind of give and
take happens in conversation,

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.360
and all that kind of stuff.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.550
AUDIENCE: I just don't--

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.260
I guess for the
experimenters, I mean--

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.177
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

01:04:15.177 --> 01:04:16.360
AUDIENCE: --team.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.030
Their behavioral response
might not necessarily

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:20.989
be the rTPJ, but
some other factor.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.180
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.265
So yes, it's possible that
the rTPJ is absolutely

01:04:27.265 --> 01:04:28.890
fine in people with
autism, and there's

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:32.610
no difference, as those initial
results seem to suggest,

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.180
and that whatever differences
you see with autism reside

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:36.870
elsewhere.

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.750
But that's surprising,
given all the stuff

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.080
I've said over the last
hour about how, at least,

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.850
in the case of moral reasoning,
these same high functioning--

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:51.360
the same people who show the
same activation of the rTPJ

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.400
have slightly different
moral reasoning, right.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.230
So there's-- yeah?

01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.940
AUDIENCE: My point isn't that.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.070
It's-- or so, for moral
reasoning, for example,

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:00.150
could be--

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.280
what they base
their morals off of

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.880
might not be determined
by some other path--

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.030
I don't know.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:09.828
They might have a slightly
different idea of what morals--

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:12.900
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yep, that's true.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.145
Yep-- Nava?

01:05:14.145 --> 01:05:17.160
AUDIENCE: This test, they
functioned the same way--

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.655
the people who are
being examined?

01:05:18.655 --> 01:05:19.530
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:20.697
AUDIENCE: --in the same way.

01:05:20.697 --> 01:05:23.130
But in a different test,
they performed different.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:26.070
So why don't they test
them when performing those?

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.170
NANCY KANWISHER: Good, good--

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:28.710
exactly.

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:30.810
So we're in this
funny position of--

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:36.030
we've sort of identified
theory of mind inferences

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.670
as a critical
difficulty in autism.

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.750
But these are people--

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.667
the only ones we can
scan on that kind of task

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:43.500
are people who are going
to already pass it.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.240
So we're already in
a weird situation.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.270
Now, you might have predicted
that they could pass it

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:50.340
based on other cognitive
abilities-- right,

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:54.330
that they come up
with another strategy.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:56.670
And in that case, they
wouldn't be using their rTPJ,

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:59.520
but another hypothesis is
it just develops later.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.180
They've got it.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:00.790
There it is.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:01.290
They use it.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.110
It activates the same.

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.610
That's yeah-- and so your point
is, why don't they test them

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:07.020
on the moral reasoning task?

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.090
Right, and see if
it comes online?

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.253
Right?

01:06:10.253 --> 01:06:12.420
AUDIENCE: Well, the one
that they can't function on,

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:12.810
because--

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:13.145
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

01:06:13.145 --> 01:06:15.090
AUDIENCE: --they don't
even know when to use it?

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.230
NANCY KANWISHER: That's right.

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.860
That's right.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.610
That's right.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:18.810
It's a very good suggestion.

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:19.770
That's probably been done.

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:20.687
And I don't know this.

01:06:20.687 --> 01:06:23.370
Heather, do you know
if people scanned ASDs

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.170
doing the moral reasoning task?

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:27.291
Probably Leanne,
has done that right?

01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:30.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I don't know.

01:06:30.622 --> 01:06:32.580
NANCY KANWISHER: It's a
really good suggestion,

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.230
and I actually now
can't think why

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:35.040
they wouldn't have done that.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.832
Do you mind just going
on PubMed and look--

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:38.970
it would be Leanne Young.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.470
And it would be--

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.600
yeah, moral reasoning and fMRI.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.875
I bet she's done that.

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.750
Maybe Heather will get
you this, because it's

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:46.710
a very good suggestion.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.960
Yeah, why not test them on
the thing that's different.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.203
OK, anyway, what I'm getting at
here is-- all these hypotheses,

01:06:54.203 --> 01:06:55.870
you guys are raising
are very good ones.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:58.410
But there's another
one, which is, maybe

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:02.730
the rTPJ isn't functioning right
even though we see it activated

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.370
more when they do
the false belief

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.460
task than the false photo task.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.230
Maybe we'd see a
difference if we

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:14.700
looked at the pattern of
responses in there, right?

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:21.510
All right, so in this
study, Koster-Hale and Saxe

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.180
did something that should be
very familiar to you guys.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.490
They took these two
cases, sort of a version

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:28.650
of what you're suggesting--

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.910
yeah, maybe it does entail it.

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:31.590
I think of it as
an MVPA experiment,

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.905
but actually, Heather,
that's the thing to look at--

01:07:33.905 --> 01:07:35.280
does Koster-Hale
see a difference

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.650
in overall magnitude?

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.580
And that I don't know.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.040
Anyway, they did
the MVPA version,

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.410
so you have subjects
do those same tasks--

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:46.260
the accidental harm,
the intentional harm.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.580
You split your data in half.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.940
And you ask whether
the rTPJ represents

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.950
the difference between
accidental harm

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.210
and intentional harm.

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:58.200
OK, everybody get why this
is a sensible thing to do?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.270
OK, so first you do that in
neurotypical subjects, OK?

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.560
And you find-- here is the--

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.260
remember, this is
the original Haxby

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.720
version, the correlation within
versus correlation between.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.880
So this is a correlation
within, and that's

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.770
a correlation between.

01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:16.800
So this is accidental--
the pattern

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.439
in the rTPJ for accidental
harm, to accidental harm

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:22.680
across stories, and
intentional to intentional

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.497
is higher than from accidental
to intentional here.

01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:28.080
I'm sort of skipping
over the details,

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.399
hoping you guys remember this.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.600
Is this making sense?

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:36.029
OK, so typical classification
with correlations,

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.370
and you see that that was
significant in this group

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:40.950
of subjects, of
typical subjects.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.050
OK, so that's cool--
so there's information

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:46.410
in the rTPJ about
whether an action was

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:47.640
intentional or accidental.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.300
That's cool.

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.710
Now we've learned
something more than just

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.300
it activates when
you do these tasks.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.830
We know something about
what it represents.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.479
But you might say,
oof, that's so teeny.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:01.260
Ick-- yeah, it was
significant, but really?

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.049
So what do you do in that case.

01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:04.972
AUDIENCE: Do it again?

01:09:04.972 --> 01:09:06.180
NANCY KANWISHER: Do it again.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.770
Absolutely.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:11.470
You don't go find some fancier
stat that gets your p level,

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.529
so you have to
start-- no, no, no.

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:15.540
You do it again.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.850
Rebecca and her lab members,
being good scientists,

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:18.689
did it again.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.770
And they got the same thing.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.609
Excellent-- new
bunch of subjects,

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:28.740
new bunch of stories, replicate
and generalize, do it again.

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:33.060
And so yes, indeed, we can--

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.120
the spatial pattern
contains information.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.609
Further, you can then--

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.830
again, in this bunch of
neurotypical subjects--

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.319
look at the degree
to which subjects

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.689
rated the moral
permissibility to be

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:47.670
different in the
intentional and accidental.

01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:51.300
Look at their behavioral
ratings during the task.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.260
That's here.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.060
And you can see,
that's correlated

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:58.680
with the degree of pattern
information in the rTPJ.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.640
OK, everybody get that?

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.480
So the more you pay attention
to that distinction,

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.590
behaviorally, when
you're doing the task,

01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:08.580
the more you think accidental
harm is really much more

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.260
OK than intentional harm.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:13.470
The greater that difference
in your behavioral ratings,

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:16.650
the greater the discrimination
ability in your rTPJ

01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:18.190
while you're doing it.

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:21.600
OK, so that's a further link
that's where the action is--

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.410
just a correlation,
not causation.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:25.050
But it's a nice one.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:28.110
Yeah, OK-- so all of this is.

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:29.840
Yeah?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.860
Yes?

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:39.795
AUDIENCE: It's the [INAUDIBLE]
there's no [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:39.795 --> 01:10:45.220
and there is a [INAUDIBLE]
--so neurotypicals have

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.840
a difference in [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.200
NANCY KANWISHER: Just
univariate overall magnitude,

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.880
accidental versus intentional,
in neurotypicals, but not

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.060
in ASDs.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.870
Aha, so it's not just
a pattern result.

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.890
AUDIENCE: Interaction--
it's in the text.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:05.780
It's not in--

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.490
NANCY KANWISHER: OK, OK, OK.

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:11.512
OK, but that's the--

01:11:11.512 --> 01:11:13.200
AUDIENCE: --interaction
of, not a--

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.756
it's just--

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.070
NANCY KANWISHER: OK,
but then the version

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:23.280
of Nava's question, which
I resonate to very much,

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.880
is if you just did the original
kind of Dufour thing of--

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.890
is the rTPJ just as
big and selective,

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:31.525
and is it in the same place?

01:11:31.525 --> 01:11:32.025
Just--

01:11:32.025 --> 01:11:34.023
AUDIENCE: If you did the
Dufour thing, though,

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:42.250
it [INAUDIBLE] there's a huge
[INAUDIBLE] so you're unable

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:43.000
to--

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.208
NANCY KANWISHER: That's true.

01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:46.030
OK, so they don't have the data.

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.530
OK.

01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:47.572
AUDIENCE: There's no way.

01:11:47.572 --> 01:11:48.820
You have to have the--

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.650
OK, fair enough.

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:51.730
OK, good point.

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:52.990
OK, so that's why--

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:54.400
you asked that question,
it's a very good question.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.317
I'm thinking, yes, they
should have done that.

01:11:56.317 --> 01:11:57.648
Reason they didn't do it is--

01:11:57.648 --> 01:11:59.440
they could have the
big sample because they

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.650
were using localizer data,
which they had from study

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.650
after study after study.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.672
Every time you run a
theory of mind test,

01:12:04.672 --> 01:12:05.630
you run that localizer.

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:07.338
And so then you just
go back a few years,

01:12:07.338 --> 01:12:08.797
and you've got 300
subjects, right.

01:12:08.797 --> 01:12:10.630
But they didn't run the
moral reasoning task

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.005
on hundreds of subjects, and
so they don't have the power

01:12:13.005 --> 01:12:13.900
to be able to see it.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.880
Yeah-- OK, fair enough.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.310
OK, so back to this.

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:22.570
This is just showing that in
the neurotypical subjects,

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:25.870
there's pattern information
in the rTPJ about intentional

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:26.933
versus accidental harm.

01:12:26.933 --> 01:12:28.600
Everybody got that--
and it's correlated

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.660
with your behavioral reading
of the moral permissibility.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.840
OK, so that's cool.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.730
So does rTPJ distinguish between
accidental and intentional harm

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:42.377
in ASDs?

01:12:42.377 --> 01:12:44.210
OK, so these are the
data I just showed you.

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:46.543
Actually, they did three
experiments showing this here--

01:12:46.543 --> 01:12:48.290
into neurotypicals.

01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:49.880
And here's the ASD data--

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.160
no difference at all.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:59.330
OK, so what that means is even
though ASDs have the same size

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.790
and location and
magnitude of response

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:04.010
of the rTPJ in the
standard localizer

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.670
task as typical subjects,
the key difference

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.820
that's been found so far is
that in neurotypical subjects,

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.870
the rTPJ holds information
about the distinction

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.000
between intentional
and accidental harm.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.500
And in ASDs, it doesn't.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.038
OK, that's probably just
one of a bunch of things

01:13:23.038 --> 01:13:24.330
that are going to be different.

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.410
This is, as far as I know, the
only one that's been published.

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:28.280
I see some squints.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.590
Are you not getting this, or do
you have a question about it?

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:32.382
AUDIENCE: What happens
to the other deficit

01:13:32.382 --> 01:13:35.703
in the behavior, sort of
being called [INAUDIBLE]??

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:36.620
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah?

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.040
AUDIENCE: Also, I have to
ask, is this exactly the same?

01:13:42.053 --> 01:13:43.220
NANCY KANWISHER: The false--

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.710
there isn't an obvious
discrimination that you can do.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:48.800
See, the nice thing about the
moral reasoning task is it's

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.000
got these two outcomes-- these
two conditions, accidental harm

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.120
and intentional harm.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.780
So that gives us a way to go
in and do the pattern analysis

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.715
questionnaire.

01:13:57.715 --> 01:13:59.090
So with false
beliefs, you'd have

01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:03.380
to think of some other
dimension to look at.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.060
And the experiments
are not set up

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.410
that way with stimuli that are
on either side of a dichotomy,

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:12.240
so that you can do
the discrimination.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.640
You could do representational
similarity analysis,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.230
actually, come to think of it.

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.490
Then, you wouldn't have to
have the whole dichotomy.

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:21.350
That's interesting.

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:23.850
OK, Heather, has
Rebecca done that?

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.620
You're my informant here.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.520
You could take--

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:33.900
OK, so Shash is
suggesting, why not

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.490
ask this kind of question
of this standard localizer

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:36.990
experiment?

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:41.460
And I said, well, it wasn't set
up with an obvious dichotomy.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.130
And then I was
thinking, actually, you

01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:47.280
could take all of the
belief conditions,

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.890
and you could do an RSA
on those in the ASDs

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:52.860
and on the typicals, and ask if
their patterns are different.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.520
Right?

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.562
I bet they've done that.

01:14:55.562 --> 01:14:57.410
See what I mean?

01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:00.560
Anyway, all right, I'll stop
speculating and just ask.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.550
She's right there,
two floors up.

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:03.980
I can just ask.

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.570
All right-- anyway,
does everybody

01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:07.080
get this basic idea here?

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.250
So the thing-- the rTPJ is
there in the high functioning

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.690
people with autism,
but it doesn't

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:13.400
hold the same information.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.370
OK-- all right.

01:15:16.982 --> 01:15:18.940
All right, so where do
we get with all of this?

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.550
We used all of this
stuff on moral reasoning

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:25.150
as a way to look at the
rTPJ and theory of mind.

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.830
We found that people
with ASD put less weight

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.660
on a person's
beliefs when judging

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.860
the moral permissibility
of an action.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.220
TMS to the rTPJ
disrupts moral judgment.

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:42.220
Pattern analysis shows
that the TPJ distinguishes

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.170
between intentional
and accidental harm

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:47.260
in neurotypicals, but
not in people with ASD.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.390
OK, so there's a nice little
story developing here.

01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:52.380
I'm sure it's not
the whole deal.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.490
Let's consider the motion of
a car on a circular track,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.570
and the track is frictionless.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.090
And it's also banked.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.590
So this is the overhead
view of our circular track.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.140
It has radius, r.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.280
And here's our car moving
at a constant velocity.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.930
Now, from the side view when
we want to look at that bank

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.340
turn-- let's draw a side view.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.490
So here's our side view, and the
car is moving with a velocity

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.600
into the plane of the figure.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.410
Now this surface
here is frictionless.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.130
And what we'd like
to do is find out

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.490
what speed the car can move
such that it doesn't slide

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.990
up or down the inclined plane.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.840
So how should we analyze that?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.240
Well our approach will be to
apply Newton's second laws.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.110
Now what's very
important to realize

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.640
is this is circular motion.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
And for circular motion
we know that the car

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.250
is accelerating towards
the center of the circle.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.020
Now from the side view, towards
the center of the circle

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.510
is in this direction.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.550
So the car is accelerating
radially inward.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.140
And that will guide how we
choose our coordinate system.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.690
And so we can then write
our free body force diagram.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.070
So let's begin
with the analysis.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.370
So we don't need to see
the overhead view anymore.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.990
So I'll just remove that, and
then we can start drawing.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.310
This is what we can refer to
as our acceleration diagram.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.220
And now let's draw
the force diagram

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.660
on the car as our
choice of system.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.250
So here's our angle, phi.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.759
Because the
acceleration was inward

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.570
we're going to choose a
radially outward coordinate

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.090
and a vertical
coordinate, K hat up.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.340
Notice that this is
different than just a mass

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.020
on a fixed incline
plane where we used unit

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.220
vectors up and down
the inclined plane.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.880
The reason we choose
our unit vectors

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.800
like that-- to
emphasize it again,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.120
is we already know this
is constrain motion.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.830
It's circular motion.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.700
Now what is the free body--
what are the forces on the car?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.280
Well there is the normal
force, the plane on the car,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.500
and the gravitational force.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.960
Now here-- whenever you're
doing problems like this

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.180
remember that the
trig is crucial to get

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.380
these angles right.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.320
So that's phi, and that's phi,
and that's our free body force

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.410
diagrams.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.470
And now we can write
down Newton's second law.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.490
So we'll start out with
our usual approach,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.030
and we have two directions
that we have to consider.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.620
So in the radial direction
there is an inward component

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.890
of the normal force, like that.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.380
And that's opposite the
angle, so it's pointing

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.060
opposite our direction.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.460
So we have minus n sine phi.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.980
The gravitational force is
only in the negative K hat

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.940
direction.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.670
And we know that the
acceleration is inward,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.730
and so there's a minus sign.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.480
We have the mass, and the
constraint for circular motion

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.400
is that that's phi
squared over r.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.350
Where r was the
radius of that circle,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.140
this can be thought of
as the central point.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.670
Now for the k hat
direction, we have

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.715
a component of the normal
force that's pointing up.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.130
I'll just draw that.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.890
That's adjacent to the angle,
so we have plus and cosine phi.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.670
And we have the gravitational
force downward, minus mg.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.710
And as far as the
vertical direction

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.060
goes, because the car
is going in a circle,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.500
there is no acceleration up or
down in the vertical direction.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.280
Again, that's a constraint
in this problem.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.610
That's equal to 0.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.760
So in this problem, this
is the side that we know,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.350
and we're trying to figure
out up to the speed, v. Now,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.910
how do we analyze this problem?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.860
Well you can see that if
I write my two equations,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.980
this n sine phi equals
mv squared over r.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.680
And cosine phi equals mg.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.820
We have two equations.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.910
We have two unknowns, v and n.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.872
Many times people
just solve for n

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:32.530
and try to find the equation--
and then substitute in,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.980
but you're also allowed
to divide two equations,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.420
and that's much easier.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.620
The masses cancel and we get the
relationship, that tan phi is v

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.240
squared over rg.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.080
And so we have our result that
the speed that the car can

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.040
travel on a frictionless
inclined plane

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.900
and maintain uniform
circular motion

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.250
is exactly the square
root of rg tan phi.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.510
And that's how we
analyze the motion

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.760
of this car on a banked turn.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.370
What we would now
like to think about

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.840
is what would happen if
you're traveling faster

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.660
or slower than this speed.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.410
So suppose we have the
prime bigger than the speed.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.250
Now, what that means is
that the car is going faster

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.270
and the new equilibrium-- if you
asked what would the radius be

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.610
such that traveling
at v primed the car

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.510
undergoes circular
motion, the prime

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.520
would be equal to
r prime g tan phi.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.320
And so in order to
go with this speed

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.830
you have to go at
a greater radius.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.490
Now what does that mean?

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.570
Well, that means that if
the car is traveling at v,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.870
so it's in this circular motion,
and now the driver increases

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.220
the speed to v
prime, the car will

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.730
start to slide up the
inclined plane-- remember,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.040
it's frictionless--
until it reaches

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.560
a-- as it starts slide
up the inclined plane

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.250
it will get to this
new radius, r prime,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.020
but because a car will have
a little inertia it will

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.100
overshoot that
speed, that radius,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.810
and then it will start to come
back down the inclined plane,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.540
and it will oscillate
about that point.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.960
It won't be sinusoidal
oscillations,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.560
but they'll be a
periodic oscillation

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.710
about this new radius, r prime.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.990
The same thing, too, if we have
the double prime less than d,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.900
then the double prime is equal
to r double prime G tan phi.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.930
Now remember, this double
prime is not two derivatives.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.480
I'm just using
that as a notation

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.350
to indicate different speeds.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.530
So if the car is going
along at speed, v, and slows

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.840
down, what would happen
is the new equilibrium

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.770
radius is smaller so the car
slides down the inclined plane

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.710
until it gets to r double prime.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.420
It turns out that it will
overshoot that a little bit,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.010
and then start to move up.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.070
And, again, it will oscillate
around this new equilibrium

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.870
length.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.750
So on a frictionless
inclined plane

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.240
if you go faster then this
speed the car slides up.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.429
If you go slower than this
speed, the car slides down.

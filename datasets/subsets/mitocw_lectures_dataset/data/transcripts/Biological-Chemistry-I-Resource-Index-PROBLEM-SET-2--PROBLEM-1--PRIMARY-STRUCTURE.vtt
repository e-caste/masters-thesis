BOGDAN FEDELES: Hi, and welcome
to 5.07 Biochemistry Online,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.150
the biochemistry course
on MIT OpenCourseWare.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.290
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.187
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.270
Now today we're going to
do a really nice problem.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.300
This is Problem 1
in Problem Set 2.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.340
Now, this is a problem
about elucidating

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.280
the primary structure
of a protein.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.890
Problems like this one
that we're about to discuss

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
are a lot of fun because they're
really biochemistry puzzles.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.240
We're given a number of
pieces of data or clues,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.510
if you want, and then
we'd have to use,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450
not only our biochemical
sense, but also

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.390
deduction and elimination
process in order

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.520
to come up with a final answer.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
Well, in practice, elucidating
the primary structure

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
of a protein is now a
largely automated process

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.020
and utilizes high resolution
mass spectrometry.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.270
Some of the traditional
chemical methods

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
that we're discussing here
are still occasionally useful.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.710
But most importantly, the
logical step-wise process

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
through which we analyze
and use each piece of data

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.880
to construct a
big picture result

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
is really representative of
the process by which we make

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.970
discoveries in biochemistry.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.000
Before we begin, let me just
say that this problem assumes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
familiarity with the structures
and abbreviations of the 20

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.850
natural amino acids.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.620
Feel free to pause
this video and review

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.830
the relevant chapters in the
book and the lecture notes

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.067
before continuing.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.630
One important tool that
we have for elucidating

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
the primary structure of
proteins is proteases.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
Proteases are enzymes that can
hydrolyze the peptide bonds

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.800
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.310
Now, proteases that can
cleave in the middle

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.720
of a polypeptide chain are
also called endopeptidases.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.060
Now you notice a
lot of these names

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.920
that end in "ase" denote
enzymes, and peptidase

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.440
means an enzyme that
acts on a peptide.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.300
It's the enzyme that
hydrolyzes the peptide bond.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.400
Endo, in this case,
refers to the fact

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.160
that it acts in the middle
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.800
Now, we're going to be learning
in this problem about trypsin

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.250
and chymotrypsin.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.800
These are proteases that
cleave in the middle

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.060
of a polypeptide chain.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.340
They are endopeptidases.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.380
One important
feature of proteases

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.420
is that they are specific.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.610
They don't just cut any which
one peptide bond, but rather

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
they recognize a specific
sequence of amino acids.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.470
In the case of
trypsin, for example,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.880
we are told that it cleaves
adjacent to positively

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940
charged amino acid.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.770
As you know, positively
charged amino acids

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.560
would be lysine or arginine.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710
So trypsin will
always be cutting

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.510
after arginine or lysine.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.850
Let's take a look.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.360
Now, here is a polypeptide
chain with amino acid residues,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.350
R1, R2, R3, R4.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.110
Now, let's look at
this peptide bond

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.240
right here in the
middle of the chain.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.310
Now let's say in
order for trypsin

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.670
to cut, to hydrolyze
this peptide bond,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.700
it means that R2, the amino
acid residue adjacent to it,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.040
should be a positively
charged one.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:11.580
So if R2 is lysine or
arginine, then this bond

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.700
here becomes a good
substrate for trypsin.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.370
And what it's going to do, it's
going to use a water molecule--

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.709
it's going to put here trypsin--

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.710
and it's going to
hydrolyze forming

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.150
a carboxyl end and an amine
end of this peptide bond.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:39.080
So we're getting this
is a carboxyl end

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:53.160
and this is the amine end of
that original peptide bond.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.640
So what I want
you to remember is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.510
that if we're having a
reaction with trypsin

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.640
on a polypeptide chain, then
the carboxy end of the peptide

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.790
that results, which is
this particular amino acid,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.540
is going to be one of
either lysine or arginine.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.100
So in other words
in a trypsin digest,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.760
all the smaller
peptides that we obtain

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.990
are going to end in arginine
or lysine except, of course,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.180
the very end of the
chain, which might

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.450
have a different amino
acid at its carboxyl end.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.320
Now, this consideration we've
just made about the trypsin

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.520
digest, in fact, answers
part 1 of the problem, which

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.110
is asking what is common about
all these peptides generated

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.060
by a trypsin digest.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.580
And as we've just explained,
all these peptides

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.700
should be ending with a
positively charged amino acid

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.440
such as lysine or arginine.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.760
This problem also mentions
another protease chymotrypsin,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.670
which is a protease that
has a different specificity

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.820
from trypsin.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.540
It actually cleaves
after amino acids

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.600
that are either very hydrophobic
and large or aromatic.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.790
So let's write that
down and remember.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.130
So if we were to do a
digest with chymotrypsin,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.560
then our R2, the residue that's
recognized by the protease,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.770
is going to have to be either
aromatic, so phenylalanine,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.380
tyrosine, or tryptophan,
or something that's

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.700
large and hydrophobic such
as leucine, isoleucine,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.450
or even valine sometimes.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.060
Put this in parentheses.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.210
So if any of these residues
are at this position,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.960
R2, then this
protease, chymotrypsin,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.310
is going to generate
two peptides.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.670
And once again, the resulting
peptide, R2 at the carboxy end

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.300
is going to be one
of these amino acids.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.350
That's going to be the signature
of a chymotrypsin digest.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.970
Now, keeping these
things in mind,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.070
we're ready to tackle
the rest of the problem.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.270
Question 2 asks about the use
of DTT, or dithiothreitol.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.990
Now, DTT is a commonly
used reducing agent,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.840
which can reduce disulfide
bridges in proteins.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.160
There are many reasons
why we want to use DTT.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.010
For example, when proteins
form disulfide bridges,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.990
you may shield
certain amino acids

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.020
from being accessible
by proteases,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.090
and therefore, they're
not going to be cleaved

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.850
and we'll get a
mixture of peptides.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.900
So it makes our analysis and
our results very difficult.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.910
Now, disulfide bridges can
also hold two peptides together

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.610
that have no other covalent
attachment between them.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.150
So in that case,
we get one fragment

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.540
instead of two fragments, and
once again, it complicates

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.120
our analysis of the protein.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.580
But more importantly,
because we're typically

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.810
purifying proteins in the
air, in an oxygen atmosphere,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.245
proteins can acquire disulfide
bonds, which weren't there

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:20.100
in the beginning.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.230
So in that case, we can
get very unusual results,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.510
unreproducible and artefactual.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:32.450
That's why using DTT can prevent
formation of spurious disulfide

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.740
bridges.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.039
And finally, DTT is
also useful to tell

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.350
if there were any disulfide
bridges in the protein

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.470
to begin with.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.440
Because if we're
looking at the analysis

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.220
before and after using DTT, we
can tell if the results change,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.900
and that will tell us whether
disulfide bridges were there

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.180
to begin with.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.680
Now, let's take a look
at the DTT chemistry.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:13.090
Here we have a disulfide
bond or bridge in a protein,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.240
and we're going to
treat this with DTT,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.140
which looks like this.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.440
This is DTT or dithiothreitol.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.800
Now, if we substitute the
SH groups with OH's, you

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.340
notice we're going to have
four OH's and four carbons.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.480
That's just an alcohol
derived from a sugar, which

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.050
is called threose That's why
the threitol part of the name.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.550
All right.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.320
So when we do this
chemical reaction,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.110
this disulfide bridge is going
to transfer between the two

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.440
sulfur atoms of DTT.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.780
They're going to form a
intramolecular sulfide bond.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:12.000
So our cysteines are
going to get reduced,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.590
and from DTT, we're going to
get this intramolecular sulfide.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.910
And because entropical
considerations,

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.440
make the formation
of the six-member

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.610
ring very, very easy, then
this equilibrium will typically

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.520
shift to the right.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.400
Of course, we're also using
vast quantities of DTT

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.360
to make sure that the entire
protein becomes reduced,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.290
and then our agent is going
to pick up this [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.400
off the bond.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.560
This sums up the question
2 of the problem.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.600
Next, we're going to
look at distinguishing

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.940
between a couple of
different peptides

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.660
that we generate during
our analysis of our mystery

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.770
protein.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.810
So we're told that we're
isolating by HPLC peptides

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.970
of the following composition.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.590
One has tryptophan,
phenylalanine,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:26.730
valine, aspartate,
lysine, cysteine.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.780
That's peptide one.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.820
Another one has phenylalanine,
serine, cysteine,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.290
and an unknown amino acid.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.251
Finally, the third one
has alanine and lysine.

00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:40.750
All right.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.320
Now, obviously, these peptides
have different compositions,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.751
so if you could just put them
through mass spectrometry,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.250
we're going to get
different masses,

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.550
so we can tell very
quickly which one is which.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.380
But if we don't have
mass spec available,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.300
we can also tell them apart
only using UV-Vis spectroscopy.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.530
So all you need to remember
is that an amino acid

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.040
like tryptophan
that we have here,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.650
W, has a very strong absorption
in the 280 to 300 nanometers.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.220
Whereas, amino acids
like phenylalanine,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.960
present here or here, they
absorb only around 260

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.310
nanometers.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.340
Most of the other amino acids
don't absorb in this range

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.670
at all.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:35.458
So if we were to plot the UV-Vis
spectra of these peptides,

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.720
this is going to
be our absorption,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.840
and this is going to be lambda
in nanometers, the wavelength.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.140
So let's look in the
range from 200 to 400.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.700
300 is about here.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.930
250 is about here.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.150
And let's label these.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:03.680
Let's say this peptide is
red, this peptide is blue,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.860
and this one is green.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.460
All right.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.190
So now the red
peptide, as I told you,

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.310
contains both tryptophan
and phenylalanine,

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.370
so it's going to
absorb both around 260

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.770
and both around 280 to 300.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.420
So it's going to have a
pretty big hump in this area

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.860
from 250 to 300.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.130
Now, the blue peptide
only has phenylalanine,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.020
so above 280 or so, nanometer
is going to drop off.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.200
So it's going to
look more like this,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.210
whereas, the green one, well,
it has neither phenylalanine

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.540
or tryptophan, so
below 240 or so,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.830
it's going to have no
UV absorption at all.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.940
So it's going to
drop off right here.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.540
So basically, if
we're just looking,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.980
say, around 260 nanometers,
we should see a stronger peak

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.920
from the red peptide and a
weaker peak from the blue one.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.180
But if we're going
to look around 300,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.320
we should only see
the red peptide.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.160
So by just using the
UV-Vis absorption,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.240
we can tell these
three peptides apart.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.660
Now we're ready to figure out
the structure of our mystery

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.430
protein.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.980
This is exactly what the last
part of the problem is asking.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.400
So we're going to take each
one of the clues provided--

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.750
A, B, C, and D--

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.820
and analyze and see
what information we can

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.800
derive from each one of them.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.050
The first piece of
information that we're given

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.870
is the result of
a total hydrolysis

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.695
of our peptide
with six molar HCl.

00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:44.260
So we're told we get
the following amino acid

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.338
composition.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:57.180
We get two phenylalanines, one
methionine, alanine, valine,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:05.630
two lysines, one serine, two
cysteine, and one aspartate.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.990
Now, recall this is not
a comprehensive list

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.020
because the hydrolysis
and six smaller HCl

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.690
may destroy some
of the amino acids.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.080
And specifically, we
know for sure something

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.997
like tryptophan,
threonine, and tyrosine.

00:15:22.997 --> 00:15:24.830
They're going to be
destroyed, and we're not

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.920
going to see them here.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.060
So these amino acids may still
be present in our protein,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.880
but we're not going to be able
to see them in this situation.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.440
Now, let's analyze
these amino acids

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.500
and see what we can
derive from this.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.700
So first of all,
we have cysteines.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.770
So two cysteines,
it means our protein

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.770
can form disulfide bridges.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.440
So from the get
go, two cysteine,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.170
it means we can form an
internal disulfide bridge

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.570
or our protein contains a
disulfide bridge between two

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.480
otherwise unconnected peptides.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.390
So here are some possibilities.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.020
For example, our
peptide is one chain,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.590
and our cysteines are
not actually connected

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.600
by a disulfide bridge.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.660
Another possibility is we
do have a disulfide bridge

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.770
between them, like that.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.960
Or yet another possibility is
that we have two pieces, two

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.740
polypeptide chains, and
the disulfide bridge

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.940
is the only thing that's
holding them together.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.760
Now, in each one of
these cases, obviously,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.300
these polypeptide
chains are oriented.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.582
So in one end, they're going
to have the amine group.

00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:50.770
Let me draw it here, NH3.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.680
Here we're going to have
two, and the other end

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.735
is going to be the
carboxyl group, COO minus.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.240
And once again, in
this case, we're

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.558
going to have two of them.

00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:12.359
All right.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:17.619
Now, how can we narrow down from
these couple of possibilities?

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.349
Well, the fact that we're
getting two lysines here

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.210
is a very important clue.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.730
Now remember, we're told that
our peptide, this mystery

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.190
protein, it actually comes as
a result of a trypsin digest.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.300
And if you recall our
discussion earlier,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.550
we said that upon
trypsin digest,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.130
all the smaller peptides
that were obtained

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.270
will end in lysine
or an arginine.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.520
The fact that we have
two lysines here,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.570
it means both of
them they need to be

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:58.500
at the carboxy ends of peptides.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.080
Because if they were in
the middle of a chain,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.090
the trypsin would have
cut that chain in half.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:16.400
So two lysines means we've
got to have two carboxy ends.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.400
So therefore, this seems to be
the only possibility in which

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.170
we can accommodate two lysines.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.980
Basically, the two carboxy
ends that we see here,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.580
each one has to be a lysine.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.250
This possibility only
has one carboxy end,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.710
so the other lysine
that we have to place

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.860
will not be at the
end, so would not

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.860
be compatible with
a trypsin digest.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.660
Same applies for this case.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:52.790
So these possibilities are
not consistent with our data.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.920
So we know already
that our protein must

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.710
look like this, two
polypeptide chains,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.680
each one ends with
lysine, and there

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.660
must be a disulfide bridge.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.430
The second clue we're given
is that the Edman degradation

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.430
of the protein yields valine.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.770
Now, as you know,
Edman degradation

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.730
is a chemical reaction by
which we can digest the protein

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.760
from the N terminus,
from the amino terminus

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.920
of a polypeptide chain.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.880
Now as you recall, we have
established in the first part

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.450
that we have two amino
termini in our protein.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.990
So the fact that we only get one
amino acid and that is valine,

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.390
it says that the
other amino terminus

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.760
might be blocked or
somehow unavailable

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.540
for the Edman degradation.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.800
So let's update the
structure of our protein

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.550
to take into account
the second clue.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.300
So we said we have two
polypeptide chains.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.670
There's a disulfide
bond in between them.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.580
Now, each one of them
ends with a lysine.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.450
This is a carboxy
end, and now we

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.020
know from the Edman degradation
that amino end of one of them

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.730
has to be valine.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.090
The other one-- we're going
to put a box like that--

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.200
is a blocked end.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.110
So the amino terminus
is not available.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.420
So this is as much as we can
tell from these first two

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.090
clues.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.510
We're given the products
of the chymotrypsin

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.810
digest of our protein
after it was previously

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.910
treated with DTT.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.690
So we know first DTT is going
to cleave the disulfide bond,

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.230
and then chymotrypsin,
as we talked previously,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.040
is going to cut after large,
hydrophobic, or aromatic

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.610
amino acids.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.751
Now, we're told we're getting
five smaller peptides.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.500
Let's take a look.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.500
Here are the five fragments.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:09.900
One is tryptophan, valine; one
is cysteine, phenylalanine,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.690
another one is aspartate
lysine, another one

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.700
is methionine, alanine,
cysteine, and lysine;

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.830
and finally, the last one
has serine, phenylalanine,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.920
and something that's
not an amino acid.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.428
It's going to make
it like a small x.

00:21:33.428 --> 00:21:35.390
All right.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.280
Now, from what we know
about chymotrypsin digest,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.610
we should be able to orient
these peptides basically

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.580
to tell which amino acid
is at the N terminus

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.070
and which amino acid is at the
C terminus of each one of them.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.680
Now the first one.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.830
Well, we know from
the second clue

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.770
that valine is at
the N terminus,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.630
so that makes it pretty easy.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.770
Then the sequence has to be V-W.
So valine is the N terminus,

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.070
W is the C terminus,
and as we said,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.470
tryptophan is one of the
amino acids recognized

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.870
by chymotrypsin, so
it's going to end up

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.610
at the carboxy terminus.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.540
C-F, that has to go C
and F, phenylalanine,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.950
another chymotrypsin
amino acid that's

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.460
left of this carboxy terminus.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.070
D-K. Now, neither
of these amino acids

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:38.680
is recognized by chymotrypsin,
but we remember from clue one

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.390
that D-K must be the
carboxy terminus.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.970
So the sequence can only be D-K.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.420
Now, here M, A, C,
and K, none of these

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.930
is actually on our recognition
list for chymotrypsin,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.410
but once again, we know that
K must be in the carboxy end.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.840
So for now we're
going to have M, A,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.240
and C in a particular order,
which we cannot establish just

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.940
yet and K at the carboxy end.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.390
And finally, we
do an S, F and x.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.570
Well, x is not
even an amino acid,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.760
and F is an amino acid that's
left of the carboxy terminus

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:26.110
by chymotrypsin, so it's
probably x, S, and F. Now,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.580
what about x?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:41.780
We're told that x is not an
amino acid and is hydrophobic

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.865
and it has a molecular
weight of 256 Daltons.

00:23:50.381 --> 00:23:50.880
All right.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.860
So in order to
figure out what x is,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.520
we have to read back the
beginning of the problem, which

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.460
tells us that we're looking
at a protein that's associated

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.140
with a plasma membrane.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.420
And one way for proteins
to associate with a plasma

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.370
membrane is to be modified,
to incorporate a fatty acid,

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.230
such as palmitate.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:17.040
So perhaps x, which is blocking
the N terminus of this peptide

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.410
is a fatty acid.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.180
Now, the general
formula for fatty acids

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.160
is something like this,
CH3 CH2 repeated, say,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.660
n times, and then COOH.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.680
So let's see what would
be the fatty acid that

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.890
has the molecular
weight 256 Daltons?

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.780
Well, the mass of a
methyl group is 15.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.800
The mass of this carboxylate
is 45, so we have about 60

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:58.290
plus 14n equals 256
or 14n equals 196.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.130
Therefore, n is 14.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.000
So the fatty acid that
would fit these criteria--

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.980
it's hydrophobic, it
has a mass of 256--

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:16.770
will be CH3, CH2 14 times
COOH, or the fatty acid

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.280
was 16 carbons.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.830
This is palmitic acid.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.580
Now, the answer that
we got, palmitic acid,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.730
was anticipated in the
text of the problem

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.380
because it gave us an example
one way to associate proteins

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.630
to the plasma
membrane is to form

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.960
a covalent linkage with a
fatty acid such as palmitate.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.400
But how does a protein
associate with a plasma

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.910
membrane when it has a palmitic
acid residue as part of it?

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.580
Well, let's take a
look at a diagram.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.670
Here we have a representation
of the plasma membrane,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.730
where we have the phospholipids
like the hydrophilic head

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.410
pointing inside and outside the
cell and the hydrophobic tails

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:09.150
of the fatty acids
lined up to each other.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.880
Now, imagine we have
a protein that's

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.450
modified to contain one
of these fatty acids.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.100
Then this fatty acid can
just insert right next

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.680
to the phospholipids
of the plasma membrane.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.460
And that way it tethers
the protein right

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.500
at the plasma membrane.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.260
The final clue that we're
given in order to figure out

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.540
the structure of
our mystery protein

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.770
is the digest with an
inorganic agent this time.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.710
It's called cyanogen bromide.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.340
Cyanogen bromide reacts quite
specifically with methionines,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.760
and it cleaves the peptide
bond after methionine

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.750
leaving behind an
unnatural amino acid called

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.570
a homoserine lactone.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.730
Now, let's take a
look at what happens

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.340
when we treat our protein
with cyanogen bromide.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:09.266
So we're told we're getting
the following peptides, A, K

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:32.470
and W, F, V, D, K, C and F, S,
C, and an unnatural amino acid.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:37.120
As I just explained to you, the
unnatural amino acid probably

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.250
is this homoserine lactone.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:51.680
So it's most likely,
instead of this amino acid

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.170
in the actual sequence,
we had a methionine.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.010
So we know these four residues--

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.720
F, S, C, and M--

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.260
go together.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.310
All right.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.070
Now, we can start putting
together the clues

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:13.020
from part 3 and 4 and try to
figure out the final structure

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.700
of our protein.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:26.210
So the peptide A, K, we know
has to have K at the C terminus.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.890
Now, from part 3, we
found out that there

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.430
was a peptide that
contained M, A, C, and K,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.380
after the chymotrypsin digest.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.553
So now we know K has
to be the carboxy end

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:45.870
and A has to be right
before K, so in order

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.080
to get an A-K
peptide, then A has

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.810
to be right after
methionine because that's

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.035
where cyanogen bromide is going
to cleave the peptide bond.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.010
So the only sequence
that we can have here is

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.220
going to be C followed
by M followed by A

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.540
followed by K. So when we
treat the cyanogen bromide,

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.420
we're going to be cleaving
this bond between M and A,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.460
generating M as a
homoserine lactone.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:21.730
Now, we also know that M has
to be in this small peptide,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.390
and we know it has to
be C, M as a sequence.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:31.540
So therefore, S and F have
to be on the amino terminus

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.370
of this peptide.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.100
And we also have a
clue from part 3, which

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:43.950
said that S, F, and this
non amino acid moiety

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:49.180
were in the same peptide.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.970
So from here we said that,
well, the sequence there, it's

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.280
probably x modifying the amino
S and then F with a carboxy end.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.760
So putting these
three things together,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.400
we can come up with a sequence
for this strand, which

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:16.300
is going to be x, S,
F, then C, M and then A

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:23.150
and K. So this is probably
one of the peptide chains

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.670
in our mystery protein.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.350
Then, of course,
the other is going

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.600
to be composed of
these amino acids.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.980
Now, we already know something
about the sequence of these.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:39.130
For example, we know V
goes before W. We also

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:50.600
know D goes before K, and also
know C goes before F. Now, we

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.880
know this has to be the carboxy
end of the peptide chain.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.220
Let's write it here, COO minus.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.720
And V has to be the amino end.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.230
So then C-F, there's no other
way, has to be in the middle.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.210
So the only possible
sequence for our second chain

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:27.950
is going to be V,
W, C, F, D, and K.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.250
Now that we've established
the exact sequence

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.200
of each one of these
peptide chains,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.450
then we can put together
the final structure

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.890
of our mystery protein.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:42.344
So I'm going to transcribe these
here, the first chain V, W, C,

00:31:42.344 --> 00:31:48.980
F, D, and K. And we know
the cysteine is going

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:54.940
to have our disulfide bridge
to the other cysteine, which

00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:03.770
goes C, M, A, K, and
then F, and then S.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:10.370
And now we know the N
terminus of this peptide,

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:19.990
we're going to have our fatty
acid residue CH2 14 times CH3.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:29.480
So let's just mark, once
again, the carboxy ends here

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.260
and the amino end here.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:41.980
So this is the final
answer for our problem

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.700
and the structure of
our mystery peptide.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.590
Well, that's it
for this problem.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.940
I hope you enjoyed this
little protein mystery hunt.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.360
Now, remember that the
strategy that we used here

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.850
in which we logically string
together pieces of data

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.780
to build a big picture, it's
really the same strategy

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.530
that has been used and is
being used right now to advance

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.880
our knowledge about living
systems and their underlying

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.030
biochemistry.

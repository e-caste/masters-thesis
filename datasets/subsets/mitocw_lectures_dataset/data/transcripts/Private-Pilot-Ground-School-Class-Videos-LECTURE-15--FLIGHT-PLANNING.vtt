00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:12.120
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.330
So I remembered something
that a physicist told me

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
about gyroscopic precession,
which I want to share with you.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.530
He said, basically,
angular momentum is always

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.430
thought of as a vector.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.350
So if you have, for example,
a helicopter rotor system,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.590
you curl your fingers in the
direction of the rotation.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.600
And then, your
thumb pointing up is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.840
the vector that represents
the angular momentum.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.430
So if, for example, you push up
at the back of the rotor disk,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.260
that's like a turn
in this direction.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.760
So now you have a
vector going this way,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.910
and the new angular momentum is
some kind of sum of those two,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.860
so the sideways vector and the
up vector, maybe a little bit

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.150
like this.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.600
And the new rotation of the
disk ends up looking this way.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.820
So that's the
gyroscopic precession.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.300
The new arc looks like
it's been pushed up

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.450
from a point 90 degrees
more advanced than the disk.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.100
So if you can remember that--

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.610
so I guess, for the
airplane propeller,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.970
let's say we could do-- it's
rotating this way, clockwise.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.560
Rotating this way, so
the vector is going out.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.710
If we push on the side, that's
like rotating this direction,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.650
so it's up.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.970
So the sum is a little
bit up like this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.820
as if it's been pushed
from the bottom.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.612
Be glad you're not a
physics major, I guess,

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:54.790
if you don't like that.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.329
MIT used to require
two years of physics.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.810
Uh-oh.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.458
The clicker is not working.

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.790
Oh, maybe it is.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.210
"O ye of little faith."

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.229
All right, flight planning--

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.930
so let's stick with
the same challenge

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.580
that we looked at
before, which is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.820
getting to Bennington, Vermont.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.510
So you have a sectional chart
and you can draw a line.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.368
I did this with SkyVector.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:23.160
I want to prove to you
that it can be done.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.150
So we basically
say, look, we want

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.780
to go from Bedford,
which is here.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.610
We put our ruler on the chart.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.720
It almost goes to
Bennington over here.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.030
Do you see that Moore
state on the chart?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.940
And you can see the
ruler is good for about

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.720
88 nautical miles, so it
doesn't quite stretch to the 90,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.420
but it can be done.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.493
And you can also see
this protractor here.

00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:56.930
We can get some
idea if we kind of

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.240
slide it up and down
the line until we

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.480
get a line of longitude.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.390
We can eventually see, OK, it's
a true course of 28 something,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.590
it looks like.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.090
All right.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.790
We'll figure that out
using electronic tools,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.080
but I just wanted to show
you that it can be done.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.235
So the key is, here, you
are making sure that the--

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.460
you know, you'll draw
this out with a pencil

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.180
and continue the line.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.240
And then, for the
protractor part,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.950
you make sure you put
it on one of these lines

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.870
of constant latitude
or longitude,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.710
which gives you an
accurate reference

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.720
to true east-west
or true north-south.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.190
So the tools-- as you just saw,
the classical tools for this

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.800
are the New York sectional
chart, which I brought,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.420
that plotter, essentially the
ruler and protractor combined,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.390
the E6B calculator which we
played around with a little bit

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.050
yesterday.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180
What's the plan for
our plan though?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.850
We want to make sure that we're
going to find an altitude that

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.230
doesn't interfere with
terrain or with which terrain

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.245
won't interfere.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.070
We want to make
sure that we're not

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.980
going through restricted
airspace that's active.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.840
Or if we are going through a
Class Charlie airspace or Class

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.510
Bravo airspace that we're
aware of that in advance

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.210
so we can make sure to be
in contact with air traffic

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.520
control.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.310
A lot of cross-country
flights, basically all of mine,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.840
I call up air traffic
control anyway

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.550
and request VFR advisories.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.690
It's an optional service.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.960
But that way, you're
pretty unlikely to blunder

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.630
into airspace that
you shouldn't be in.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.590
We're going to check--

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.750
and actually, that reminds
me of something, a comment.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.210
You know, this
ground school stuff,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.850
I think it turns some people
off of flying, per se.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.892
The people who are really
interested in the stick

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:06.810
and rudder stuff, they
say, you know, god,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.520
I don't want to learn
about all that airspace.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.020
I don't want to deal with all
those air traffic controllers.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.420
I just want to fly.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.650
That kind of flying is hard
to do at Hanscom Field, which

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.490
is the ninth busiest airport
in the northeast after airports

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.020
such as Logan and
LaGuardia and JFK,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.450
but it's very easy to do in a
lot of parts of the country.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.680
You know, if you're out
west, most airports--

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.670
you have thousands
of airports in the US

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.200
that don't have
control towers, that

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.890
don't have any traffic, that are
surrounded by Class G airspace.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.270
You do whatever you want.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.530
So that kind of flying exists.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.110
To get to private, the
FA wants to make sure

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.000
that you've at least learned
this stuff so, if you become

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.110
that kind of a backwoods
pilot, that you don't blunder

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.830
into JFK Class Bravo airspace.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.570
But that kind of fun
flying does exist.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.230
The other thing I
wanted to say is,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.640
in all kinds of
flying education,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.410
there's an emphasis
on the hazardous.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.863
You saw some of that, I
think, yesterday with Mark.

00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:11.280
He talked-- you've
got to do this.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.760
You've got to scan for
this because you don't want

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.370
to have a midair collision.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.190
Midair collisions
or 1% of accidents

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.960
last year according
to the Nall Report.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.150
If you're interested
in these statistics,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.200
the AOPA Safety Foundation
ASF, or Air Safety Institute,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.888
I guess, they have this thing
called a Nall Report, N-A-L-L.

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:32.430
Every year, they analyze all
the kinds of accidents that have

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.180
occurred.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.510
But midair collisions
are exceptionally rare,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:42.000
like I said, 1% of accidents,
maybe 3% of fatal accidents.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.482
So flying tends to
be pretty forgiving.

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:47.190
Usually, most people
who have an accident

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.570
have made three
or four mistakes.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.470
It's not like one little mistake
is going to generally get you

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.110
into trouble.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.680
So I don't want people
to think that it's

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.280
all bureaucracy and
regulations all the time

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.000
when you're up in the air,
or that, at any moment,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.290
the airplane could
suddenly stall and spin,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.880
that kind of stuff.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.585
It's just extremely rare.

00:07:08.585 --> 00:07:09.960
If you're flying
a Cirrus, you're

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.950
nowhere near the stall
in any phase of flight

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.120
as long as you're doing things
more or less by the book.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.800
OK.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.810
So anyway, this is our plan, and
we'll follow this kind of step

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.400
by step.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.020
OK.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.060
So if we look at
the sectional chart,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.330
we can see that there's these--

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.910
see that 41?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.973
That tells you that, if
you're at 4,100 feet,

00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:43.140
you have a little bit of
clearance from the terrain,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.682
not enough for flying
on instruments,

00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:47.970
but enough for flying visually.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.630
We can also see the
only real airspace

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.990
that's on our route is the
Class Bravo airspace itself,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.430
and that goes from 4,000 feet
up to 7,000 feet over top

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.360
of Hanscom Field.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.600
So as long as we're in
contact with Hanscom tower

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.910
and we're not climbing in
some kind of fighter jet,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.700
we're going to be clear
of Bravo airspace.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.380
And also, if we have
a plane with a GPS VOR

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.300
receiver combined
and part of it fails,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.300
you can see there's all these
VORs around here, including

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.970
one very close to the
airport that we're going to.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.770
So we're not going to get lost,
even if we can't find Venus

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.520
like Captain Sully, can't
talk to air traffic control,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.440
and can't use our GPS, and
can't look out the window.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.710
Actually, a lot of times, we
send soloing students to Keene,

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.720
New Hampshire because it's
right next to Mount Monadnock.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.332
And we figure,
well, they probably

00:08:46.332 --> 00:08:48.790
can't get lost if there's only
one big mountain sticking up

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.140
by itself right
next to the airport.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.950
All right.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.600
It's always good to have a plan.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.660
What if you cross the
mountains and the airport

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.220
is hard to find, if the
airport is covered in some fog,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.500
if somebody has driven
a huge lawnmower

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.740
onto the middle of the
runway and gotten stuck,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.560
what do we do?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.020
So it's always good
to have a backup plan.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.940
Here's Albany.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.820
Remember I told you that
story about the Cirrus hero.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:25.010
So he wanted to go here,
to Rensselaer, RPI,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.550
and here's the huge Albany
airport with a wonderful FBO.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.140
It's very inexpensive, cheaper
than Hanscom actually for fuel.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.870
And here's the airport
that he was thinking about.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.580
See it says that it's
a 2,700-foot runway,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.910
but due to the
displaced thresholds,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.193
it's actually shorter.

00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:43.610
That doesn't have
a control tower.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.360
That C means it's a common
traffic advisory frequency.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.730
Albany, of course, is a
Class Charlie airport,

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.490
so it has all kinds
of great services.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.790
Anyway, so for our alternate,
if things aren't going well,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.600
I want to be drinking
free coffee at the FBO

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.440
and borrowing the crew car and
going to a nearby restaurant,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.880
not standing out
there in the wind,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.200
wondering why nobody's at the
Rensselaer County Airport.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.580
OK, so we found an
alternate airport,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.880
not required unless you're IFR,
but always good to think about.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.720
Another reasonable
alternate for Bennington

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.240
would be just to make a
U-turn and go back to Hanscom

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.870
because it's not
really all that far.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.370
All right.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.640
We can look at the chart
supplement for Bedford

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.470
if that's not our home airport.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.170
Remember, this gives all
the information about radio

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.940
frequencies and runways.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.490
Similarly for
Bennington, Vermont,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.930
we can see it's a
3,700-foot runway.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.610
Not too much else
that's interesting

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.560
here except, if it's
going to be nighttime,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.600
it says the lights won't be on.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.330
We should activate the
medium intensity runway

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.070
lights on the CTAF frequency.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.700
So if we click the
microphone five times,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.000
all the airport
lights will come on.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.820
That'll be nice.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.500
Otherwise, not too exciting.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.230
Looks like this runway
is slightly sloped.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.940
That's one thing about Vermont.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.490
See it says 0.9%
slope up, so that's

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.975
going to have a slight
effect on our performance.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.450
OK.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:29.150
So in the old days, we would
just call this 1-800 number

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.490
and get our weather briefing.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.650
Or if we were en
route, we might call--

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.290
you can see Bridgeport radio
is available here on the VOR.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.190
The VOR for Providence
indicates that, if you

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.910
want to talk to Bridgeport
radio, you call them on 122.6,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.960
so we can also talk
to Bridgeport radio.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.940
Although, if we're going
to do a flight plan,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.045
we want to get most of
our stuff done beforehand.

00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:57.170
We can look at our AIRMETs.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.690
This is an older slide.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.160
This is not current data,
but at least, at some time,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.970
there was an AIRMET for IFR
and Mountain Obscuration.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.850
So in that case, we might
consider deferring our flight.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.880
There was also AIRMET
Tango for turbulence.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.810
So look at this.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.710
Is it time to freak out?

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.400
Well, it says
moderate turbulence.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.410
They used to always say
occasional moderate.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.520
Now they don't put the
occasional in there.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.920
But really, that means there may
be turbulence below 8,000 feet.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.110
Usually, once you get
about through half

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.880
of the turbulence
forecast altitude,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.520
it smooths out considerably.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.160
So if it says, as I
mentioned yesterday,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.640
the turbulence forecast goes
up into the flight levels,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.100
it's a pretty ugly day.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.620
If it goes up to
8,000 feet, that's

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.250
kind of a standard slightly
windy New England day.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.140
All right.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.540
And you know, you might
get a few bumps climbing up

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.820
to 4,000 or 5,000.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.970
METARs-- you get
this list of METARs.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.390
So as I said yesterday, once
you get used to reading these,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.530
this is actually--

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.610
I prefer this format.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.110
It's very compact.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.480
You can just zip down.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.690
We can just assume these are
along our route of flight

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.430
if we get them in
our briefing format.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.120
So we can see, oh,
it's gusting 19 knots.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.560
It's a gusty day.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.520
When we get to Bennington,
it's 300 at 5 knots,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.030
10 miles broken 7,000.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.462
That's pretty reasonable.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.490
Terminal forecasts-- you
heard about that yesterday.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:40.100
But again, we get them from the
briefer or the briefing format

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.050
along our route of flight.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.547
Remember our goal is to
maintain VFR weather minimums.

00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:48.380
Again, you can see how
much more challenging

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.520
this is than in a jet.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.260
If you were in a
jet, you would say,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.280
well, I don't need to maintain
VFR because I'll file IFR,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.410
and I don't need to
remain clear of icing

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:03.500
because I can turn on the icing
unless it's incredibly severe.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.600
But you guys will
have this challenge,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.440
at least until you decide that
you want to get your instrument

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.350
rating or you want to bring
along a co-pilot who's

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.820
instrument rated.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.840
Winds aloft is very
important for this flight

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.310
or for this flight
planning task.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:23.580
We can see Boston.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.020
Albany winds might be the best.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.330
So the winds are coming
from 330, more or less

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.410
in our face at 28 knots.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.910
And the temperature
outside is minus 10.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.290
So if it is cloudy, that
means there's a risk of icing.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.320
So in a Piper
Warrior or Cirrus, I

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.500
wouldn't do this
trip on this day

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.420
unless I thought that
I could remain clear

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.880
of the clouds due to that--

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.090
you know, if you saw that, at
6,000 feet, it was above zero,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.850
that would be great.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.120
OK, relevant NOTAMs-- the VASI.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.630
See that on the bottom?

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.980
The VASI at DDH
is out of service.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.930
So that means we're
not going to have

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.350
our visual reference for the
glide slope to the runway.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.750
If it's your home airport,
that's not a big deal.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.420
If it's daytime at an
unfamiliar airport,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.890
that's not a huge deal.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.680
Nighttime at an
unfamiliar airport,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.630
that's kind of a problem.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.130
So you might consider,
at nighttime,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.580
it's better to treat that
like instrument flight.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.110
You might not want to go.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.310
Actually, in my airline days,
we got to this airport at night.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.400
We were really delayed
for a variety of reasons.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.160
But anyway, we get to this
airport in Michigan at night,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.460
and I'm flying left traffic
from the right seat,

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.870
so I can't really see
the airport that well,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.680
in this Canadair Regional Jet
which I've just barely learned

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.500
to fly, exclusively in the sim.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.230
The first flight in
the real aircraft

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.510
was with passengers in the back.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.678
And the runway's
under construction, so

00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:59.220
the instrument landing system
which gives you the glide slope

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.190
reference, that's out of service
because it would lead you

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.290
to a part of the
runway that's closed.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.710
And the VASI and PAPI
that are normally there

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.280
at this big airport in
Saginaw or wherever it was,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.420
that's also out of service.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.820
So it's just a pure
visual approach

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.620
based on the configuration
of the runway

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.520
lights and the geometry
and how it looks,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.380
just like you are flying a
Cessna or a Piper in this jet.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.110
So we got on the
ground, and like I said,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.850
I'm piloting from
the right seat.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.550
I should, perhaps, have just
turned it over to the captain

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.280
and said this is a little
beyond my skill level.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.910
But I wanted the
practice, so I did it.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.750
And we turned off the
runway, and nobody

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.120
was more surprised
than I when we were

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.160
on the ramp, safe and sound.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.310
We got out of the airplane
and this passenger was irate.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.990
He thought somehow
it was my fault.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.050
He saw me having dinner with
a friend at the terminal.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.260
He thought I was the
reason for the delay,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.840
that the flight was held up for
my dinner, and he was enraged.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.550
And I thought to
myself, this guy

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.030
has no idea how lucky he is to
be alive with somebody like me

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.370
at the controls with no
visual references of any kind,

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.089
the first time at
that airport, going--

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:10.323
145 knots was the slowest speed
that we were going at any time.

00:17:10.323 --> 00:17:10.990
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.111
So a question on-- just
the one VASI is out, right?

00:17:14.111 --> 00:17:16.508
So is there a circumstance,
like if the winds were calm,

00:17:16.508 --> 00:17:19.050
you could say, OK, won't land
on 31, I'll land the other way?

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.520
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
On the other runway?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.630
You don't want to land
with a tailwind in general,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.819
and there may not be--

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.670
we could go back,
but there may not

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.050
be a VASI on the other side.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.790
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.248
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Usually, airports

00:17:30.248 --> 00:17:33.450
have sort of one runway
that they really love.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.550
Actually, that's interesting.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.320
First of all, they
don't even have a VASI.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.300
They have a PAPI on both sides.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.940
So yeah, actually, that's a
good example of decision making.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.610
If the wind's not too bad--

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.120
and actually, at nighttime,
the wind usually quiets down.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.507
So yeah, perfect example
of good decision making.

00:17:51.507 --> 00:17:52.590
Just use the other runway.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.630
Why not?

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.382
All right.

00:17:55.382 --> 00:17:56.340
So we used the plotter.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.215
You saw some of that.

00:17:57.215 --> 00:18:01.440
We draw our line.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.020
You can see there we're
referencing the plotter

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.255
to true north and we get--

00:18:06.255 --> 00:18:08.130
well, this is not for
the Bennington example,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.780
unfortunately.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.650
We get a true course of
038 to some other airport.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.900
Here's what I did
want to show you.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.080
You find some prominent
landmarks along the route.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.480
We talked about that yesterday
in the piloted section,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.960
so things you can
identify from the air.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.430
You get your blank
navigation log form.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.200
You pick an altitude.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.050
So this is one reason
why midair collisions

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.080
are exceedingly rare.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.880
If people are above 3,000
feet above the ground,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.610
higher than 3,000
feet above the ground,

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.655
then you get up to your
conventional cruising altitude.

00:18:51.655 --> 00:18:53.030
So if you're on
instruments, it's

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.170
going to be whole thousands.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.500
So you'll fly on
instruments at 6,000, 8,000,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.270
for example, if you're
on a westbound course.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:09.780
And you'll fly 5,000, 7,000,
9,000 if you're eastbound.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.870
And then just add
500 if you're VFR.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:17.130
So airplanes at low
altitudes that are cruising

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.160
are almost always
separated by 500 feet.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.340
And therefore,
the conflicts tend

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.630
to occur very near airports,
and the conflicts also

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.410
tend to occur--

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.570
there's one exception
to that rule.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.430
On days when there
is a low cloud

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.940
layer like at 3,000
feet, for example,

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.830
or 2,500 feet and
everybody who is

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.200
VFR is trying to go
under the clouds,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.970
that's when you might
see other airplanes

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.070
and have to be vigilant.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.862
But again, you can call
air traffic control

00:19:46.862 --> 00:19:48.280
and ask for advisories.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.890
Or now, by January
1 of 2020, everybody

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.230
will have a ADS-B so they
have a box in there that's

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.810
squawking at you.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.370
Let me tell you that, when
you land at Burning Man,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.200
your fancy traffic
warning system will

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.720
get very upset indeed.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.040
We had warnings.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.167
Burning Man has this--
it's not like Oshkosh.

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:12.250
It's super well-organized.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.860
They have people
converging, by design,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.470
from three different
directions to a single point,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.110
flying a pattern that's 500
feet above the runway instead

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.315
of the conventional
1,000 or 1,500

00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:24.820
for turbine-powered aircraft.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.900
And then you're landing on
a place that's not normally

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.860
considered a runway.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.800
So in the Pilatus, we had
the terrain warning system

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.890
going nuts because
it didn't know

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.450
that there was a runway there.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.750
And we also had the
traffic system going nuts

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.080
because we didn't
have ADS-B but we

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.720
had enough transponder-equipped
aircraft around us

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.790
that it could see them all.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.430
So that was pretty upsetting.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.510
Not as upset as the cool Burning
Man people were to see me,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.383
but my friend had a good time.

00:21:02.383 --> 00:21:06.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what does that mean

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.040
if you have [INAUDIBLE],, like
if there could be a situation

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.095
but there is none?

00:21:10.095 --> 00:21:12.095
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
this slide should really

00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:14.560
contain that exception,
that it's only up to 3,000

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.050
above the--

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:21.430
it's 3,001 feet above
the ground and above.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.490
So the question was, what
if you have low clouds?

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.690
How can you do this?

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.450
The answer is, if you're
3,000 feet and below,

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.150
these conventional cruising
altitudes don't apply.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.510
OK.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.210
Oh, yeah, so this is just
an elaboration of that.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.710
So we're going to be on
a magnetic course that's

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.800
generally westbound, so
we'll pick 4,500 feet.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.860
Do we need oxygen
for our flight?

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.360
The answer is no.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.770
That's a good thing.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.150
If you are going to be
flying above 10,000 feet

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.270
though, if you were
doing a charter flight,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.550
you would need oxygen.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.310
So you might ask
yourself, well, if it's

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.850
good for the charter crowd,
why isn't it good for me?

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.850
I do think that it--

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.280
especially as you
get older, people

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.970
tend to get a lot more sharp
if they keep the cabin altitude

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.485
5,000 and below or use
supplemental oxygen

00:22:29.485 --> 00:22:30.360
in a little airplane.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.580
All right, there's
your chart, 91.211.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.800
You might be asked about that.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.980
All right, let's go back.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.770
So we've got--

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:46.892
I guess, in this flight planning
example, we've done 6,500 feet.

00:22:46.892 --> 00:22:48.600
So you can see we
filled in the altitude.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.110
We're going to climb,
go to 6,500 feet.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.610
Our true course is 287, and
you can see these fixes.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.880
They'll be in Fitchburg,
crossing the river,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.120
finding some reservoir,
finally landing at Bennington.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.910
So we'll just see what
the folks-- these slides

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.760
were built before Tina and
I took over the course.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.240
All right.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.840
As I said, pick
those winds aloft.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.955
It says reporting points.

00:23:19.955 --> 00:23:21.330
Actually, that
should be changed.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.010
That's inaccurate.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.718
They're not winds
aloft reporting points.

00:23:23.718 --> 00:23:26.550
These are always forecast.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.310
There's no balloons up there
with sensors to tell you

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.990
exactly what the winds are.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.580
OK.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.670
Maybe somebody can remind me
after the class to change that.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:43.700
OK, so we fill in the forecast
wind, and then we use our--

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.562
actually, no.

00:23:45.562 --> 00:23:47.270
We're going to need
to find the airspeed,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.440
so we look up the performance
tables for our Piper Warrior

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.617
or we pay up for that
Gyronimo app that you saw--

00:23:54.617 --> 00:23:56.450
I don't know if they
have a Warrior version,

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.980
but maybe they do--

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.630
and we pull the
numbers out of there.

00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:06.240
I'll just let you digest
this for a moment.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.830
All right.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.625
The important
takeaways from here

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:17.250
are we're going to burn about 2
and 1/2 gallons in the climb, 2

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.860
gallons in the
cruise, and you can

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.980
see how many minutes it's going
to take to climb and descend.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.110
So that'll just go into our
calculation of the total time.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.270
All right, so we've
got that in there.

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:36.140
See we've got our
true air speeds

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.205
for climbing and descending.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.180
What about cruising?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.530
So we use the performance
charts to figure out

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.500
that we're going to be going
along here at about 112 knots

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.780
before the wind hits us.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.190
We add that to our plan.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.720
We've got all these distances.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.230
We've measured that with
our protractor and ruler

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.610
with our plotter.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.310
So we've got the
distances for each leg.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.685
We filled in the
true air speeds.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.370
OK.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.068
Now we do the wind correction.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:24.460
So remember, if we're reading,
everything is in true.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.280
If we're hearing it
on the ATIS, ASOS,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.230
or from the control
tower, you can just say,

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.022
wind check, please.

00:25:30.022 --> 00:25:32.147
You don't have to say your
tail number or anything,

00:25:32.147 --> 00:25:34.030
and the tower is going
to broadcast back

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.900
to you, winds 310 at 12.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:41.710
OK.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:42.730
So here's an example.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.488
I can do it in real time
also on the doc camera,

00:25:47.488 --> 00:25:48.530
but let me show you this.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.610
So if the wind's
from 210 at 20 knots

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.960
and you're trying to go south
at a true air speed at 147--

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.120
that's a good Cirrus speed--

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:05.130
you line up 210
to the true index.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.680
And then we're going to draw
a little 20 knot vector here.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.347
It really doesn't
matter where we start.

00:26:09.347 --> 00:26:12.830
We're going to draw a
20 knot vector here.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.090
So there's a little
point for 20 knots up.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.250
That represents our wind.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.960
Some people actually
draw it as a vector.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.010
Imagine a little vector here.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.590
Or actually, it'd
be going this way.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.360
Then we rotate so that
we show our true course.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.620
So we're trying to go
south, and the wind

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.420
is from this direction,
and we've lined it up.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.490
See how there is 140, 150?

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.320
So that's roughly at 147.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.520
So it tells us, with this
little subtraction here,

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.920
we're going to be going just
slightly slower than 130

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.130
knots or 129 as it
says on the slide,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.630
and we're going to need
to steer about 4 degrees

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.535
off the true course.

00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:03.240
Does that all makes sense?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.337
It's a little graphical
calculator, basically,

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:07.420
and the idea is you're
starting with a vector that

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.168
represents the wind.

00:27:09.168 --> 00:27:10.960
You can play around
with this at the break.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.380
And I'll also try using
it on the doc camera

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.450
and you'll see just
how much a person can

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:22.040
forget in 17 years or 18 years.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.540
OK.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.840
Now we've filled this in.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.910
We've said, OK, there's
our true air speed.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.840
Here's our wind
correction angle.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.600
Where is our ground speed?

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.830
Oh, there's our ground speed.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.580
OK.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.890
So from the ground speed
and the leg distance,

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.860
of course, we'll be able
to determine the time.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.720
Now this is the exciting part.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.900
Since we're only
going 90 knots, we

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.830
can figure out, for
any given leg length,

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.150
how long it's going to take.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:55.800
So we do that.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.610
Eventually we'll fill it in.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.110
Oh, yeah.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:07.040
We've got to get the
magnetic variation.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.020
So our true heading is supposed
to be 293 or 283, I guess,

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.440
in the cruise, and we add
in the west variation.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.200
Remember east is
least, west is best.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.800
So we've added in that
magnetic variation

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.010
and that's the magnetic heading.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.100
If we happen to have--

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.970
oh, yeah.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.960
There's a point to this slide.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.230
So what if we take all
that metal fishing gear

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.750
and throw it into
the float plane?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.570
That might actually affect
the compass, especially

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.190
if you're up in Alaska.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.900
Until about 2001 or
2002, it was required

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.270
to carry a gun in your
airplane at all times when

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.000
you were flying in Alaska unless
you were in the traffic pattern

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.220
at an airport doing flight
training or something.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:29:01.120
So if you had your huge rifle up
in the front of your aircraft,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.320
then your compass actually
could be thrown off by the gun

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.390
that you were required to carry.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.730
Who knows why you
had to carry a gun?

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.790
Why do you have to carry
a gun in your Cessna?

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.550
AUDIENCE: Bears.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.652
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Bears, that's right.

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:17.110
Anyway, they changed the law,
so now you can be a pacifist.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.640
You had to have
ammo too actually.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.110
I think they could
bust you if you

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.360
didn't have ammo for your gun.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:27.870
All right.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.797
Actually, I was going to Alaska
and the regulation was just

00:29:34.797 --> 00:29:36.380
being sunset, so I
thought, well maybe

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.030
I should bring a gun with me.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.102
So I asked a friend who's
a gun enthusiast, what

00:29:41.102 --> 00:29:42.060
would be the right gun?

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.350
And he said, oh, you need
this Benelli shotgun,

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.970
automatically
reloads the shells,

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.820
and you can fire off a whole
bunch of shotgun shells

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.050
at once.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.020
It's like, you know,
where can I get one?

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.048
And he said, oh, I've
got five, so you can just

00:29:56.048 --> 00:29:56.840
borrow one of mine.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.640
OK.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.670
So yeah, here's another
East Coast Aero Club plane.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.770
You've got to
calculate your time.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.624
It might be pretty fast.

00:30:12.624 --> 00:30:13.785
That's from Oshkosh.

00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:14.660
They brought the B-1.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.060
Actually, this B-1 wasn't--

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.960
they ran away from that huge
thunderstorm that I showed you.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.900
So I went through the
thunderstorm in a $99 tent,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.830
and the B-1 left.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.110
And the B-1 taking
off was louder

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.760
than anything that happened
during the thunderstorm.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.510
It was crazy loud.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.260
All right, so we've
got it all filled out.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.660
It looks like it's going to
take us a total of one hour.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.560
Does that make sense?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.060
Yeah.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.510
I guess about 90
knots about 90 miles,

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.690
so yeah, that makes sense.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.190
OK.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.480
We calculate the fuel burn.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.100
So it's going to take us a
minimum of 11 gallons or so

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.770
to get there, and we want
to have a half-hour reserve.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.280
I can tell you that's pretty
scary to see the gauges down

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.520
that low.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.690
So I think a plan for
a one-hour reserve

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.420
is about as low as you
would ever want to plan.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.960
And then beyond that,
we should add some fuel

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.200
to get to our
alternate if necessary.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.800
In the instrument
flying world, you

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.693
plan to fly to your destination,
fly to your alternate.

00:31:23.693 --> 00:31:25.110
Actually, fly to
your destination,

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.420
fly in instrument approach,
kind of fly the mist,

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.180
fly to the alternate,
and then fly around

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.510
for another 45 minutes
to an hour after that.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.360
All right.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.170
What about the VFR
fuel requirements?

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:43.470
So again, the FAA minimums
are pretty scanty,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.710
30 minutes for the
day time, 45 at night.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.720
For helicopters, they're
even less, 20 minutes

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.830
and 30 minutes, 20 minutes
day and 30 minutes at night.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.350
OK, weight and balance--

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.810
that's off the tail of
a Piper Cub at Oshkosh.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.270
Unfortunately, we don't have
that on the Warriors, which

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.680
nobody loves quite as much.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.747
So the glorious plan here--

00:32:04.747 --> 00:32:06.330
some of these older
airplanes actually

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.980
have better payloads
when they're fully

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.560
fueled than the latest and
greatest because they're not

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.820
crammed with as much
helpful avionics.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.590
Anyway, so the original
Warrior, this plan

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.880
is to take two heavy
people in the front,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.740
400 pounds total, two more
virtuous people in the back,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.770
and 50 pounds of bags.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.180
And you see the max gross
weight is 2,325 on this Piper.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.830
So can we do it?

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.950
You're going to have a
long, not to say tedious,

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.690
lecture on weight
and balance later,

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.870
so we won't belabor this.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:45.503
But if you look at that loading,
the perspective loading,

00:32:45.503 --> 00:32:46.920
I think we should
expect that it's

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.790
going to be within the
center of gravity limits

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.780
because the heavier
people are in front.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.080
And the real issue is whether
we're overweight or not.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.840
So we are actually overweight.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:13.530
See that 2,334, and
2,325 is the maximum,

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.290
so we're about 10
pounds overweight.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.610
How about, are we out of CG?

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.790
We're at about 92 inches.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:25.440
And you can see here that the
CG envelope goes to about 93.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.600
I guess it goes exactly to 93.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.037
So the CG is fine, but
the weight is too high.

00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:32.870
What's the question?

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.770
AUDIENCE: Where would you
find all of the information

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.937
about the load requirements?

00:33:36.937 --> 00:33:39.187
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh, yeah,
so that's a good question.

00:33:39.187 --> 00:33:41.850
Where do you find all the
information about the weight

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.375
and balance that you're going
to use for this calculation.

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:45.750
So remember we
talked about AROW.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.708
You have to have the
airworthiness certificate,

00:33:47.708 --> 00:33:49.140
the registration.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.010
The owner's manual, I think, is
the best way to think of the O,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.890
and W is the weight and balance.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.340
So it has to be in the aircraft.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.550
It's usually just in the same
binder as the pilot's operating

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.697
handbook or the AFM.

00:34:01.697 --> 00:34:02.280
So it's there.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.600
It's specific to the airplane.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.290
And the airplane will get
re-weighed periodically,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.670
and if any kind of
equipment is changed out,

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.780
they throw it in there.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.550
But also, these apps--

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:19.440
I mean, the arm of the rear
seats in a Piper Warrior, that

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.420
doesn't change from
aircraft to aircraft,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.800
so you just punch that in.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.670
You just punch in, I
think, the total moment

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.889
and the total weight
of the empty airplane

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.719
into an app like
Gyronimo, and then it'll

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.489
calculate the rest
of it for you.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:36.449
But it already has the arms for
each position in the aircraft.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.430
Remember that's just
a distance from--

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.370
they'll pick some arbitrary
point on the aircraft

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.350
like just in front
of the propeller,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.570
and you're looking at
the number of inches

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.670
back from the
propeller, for example.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.320
That make sense?

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.320
OK, so we're overweight.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.122
Will it fly 10
pounds overweight?

00:34:55.122 --> 00:34:56.080
What do you guys think?

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.527
AUDIENCE: It will.

00:34:57.527 --> 00:34:58.610
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It will.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.270
And it will actually
fly up to about 30%

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:05.050
overweight generally, because
I think people get waivers

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.930
to take off with
an extra fuel tank

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.780
when they're trying to cross
the Atlantic or the Pacific

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.130
Ocean or something.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:18.940
However, it's an
especially bad idea

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:24.640
to go overweight
if it's turbulent

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.470
because the aircraft is designed
for handling turbulence up

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.490
to its gross weight.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.220
So that's one thing that happens
when people fly over gross,

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.860
is that it tends
to strain things

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.860
that shouldn't be strained.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.943
So it's a bad practice
as a regular matter.

00:35:41.943 --> 00:35:44.110
And of course, you're also
reducing your performance

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.070
margins.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.990
But you know, on a winter
day in New England,

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.230
you have ample
power, so it's not

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.110
like the airplane won't fly.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:57.370
But it's not legal to
fly, and I try never

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.883
to exceed the gross weight.

00:35:58.883 --> 00:35:59.800
What was the question?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.847
AUDIENCE: I thought maneuvering
speed goes up with weight.

00:36:03.847 --> 00:36:05.680
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It
does go up with weight.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.638
That's a good question.

00:36:06.638 --> 00:36:09.010
If maneuvering speed
goes up with weight,

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.580
why do you start bending things?

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.880
I think that it's not
just G-loads that'll

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.110
bend the aircraft.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:22.070
It's also the overall weight
of the stuff in there.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.720
I don't know.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.230
That's a good question
for a real Course 16

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.600
or Course 2 engineer.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.620
What do you guys think?

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.870
That's what I've heard though.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.877
If you load it up, it will--

00:36:33.877 --> 00:36:35.960
AUDIENCE: There's a max
[INAUDIBLE] weight, right,

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.150
which has nothing to
do with air holds?

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.400
PHILIP GREENSPUN: That's true.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.590
But I have heard that,
if you're in smooth air,

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.882
you'll probably get away with
it for quite a long time.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.150
But also, you want that
performance margin.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:54.860
If you get into a downdraft
off the lee side of a mountain,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.290
you want some kind of
reasonable climb rate.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.865
And if it's one pound over
gross, you're going to be good.

00:37:01.865 --> 00:37:03.970
But the higher you
go over gross weight,

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.110
the less performance
margin you have.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.250
That's why training is so great
in a four-seater helicopter

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:14.420
or airplane because you have
a lot of power to get yourself

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.930
quickly out of an
uncomfortable situation,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:24.080
whatever it is, because of those
two empty seats in the back.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:24.820
All right.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.320
Takeoff performance-- we
figured out that we only

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.080
need 1,000 feet of ground roll.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.170
And there are really no
obstacles at Hanscom Field,

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.900
so the 2,000 foot number
isn't even relevant.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.690
We have 7,000 feet of
runway so we're good there.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.610
Landing, we're going to clear
a 50-foot obstacle, which

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.070
we can expect to find
probably in Vermont.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.290
They have plenty
of trees and hills,

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:53.900
so let's make sure we have
at least 1,500 feet of runway

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.440
plus some margin, which we do.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.960
So the book says we can
land in 40% of the runway.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.900
And remember I told you
that, for airline operations,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.360
you try to make sure you
can land in at least 60%

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.390
of the runway, so
we're good there.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.300
Here's the sample
flight plan form.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.430
At the bottom, I
say a fun exercise

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:22.080
is to look at the ICAO, the
international flight plan form.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.050
I should have probably
put in another slide.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.810
It's so complicated that there's
nobody on the planet, I think,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:31.390
that can really fill it out, but
computers will do it for you.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:36.350
Anyway, here, this has been in
use probably since the '50s.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:40.520
You're just telling the FAA
what kind of aircraft you have.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.100
A few things-- when they
ask you what type it is,

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:48.950
that would be something like
SR20 for a Cirrus or PA-28

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.520
for a Piper Warrior.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.060
True air speed is going
to be as computed,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:03.440
not indicated but corrected
for your pressure and density

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.510
altitude.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.640
Also, on the aircraft
type, there's

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.900
a slash for special equipment.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:17.520
So if you have a GPS on board,
which is no longer special,

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.430
you're supposed to put slash
Golf, so SR 20 slash Golf,

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.670
so the controllers, if they
are actually talking to you,

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.090
they know that they can tell you
to go direct to some fix that's

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.750
only in the GPS.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.708
Anybody find the ICAO form?

00:39:31.708 --> 00:39:32.750
Who wants to fill it out?

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.290
All right, good.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.440
Actually, let's do
it the real way.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.272
Let's go over here to the
doc camera for a moment.

00:39:45.272 --> 00:39:48.280
So you've got your
handy dandy pencil,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.980
and let's say the wind
is from the north.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.940
So we just pick
any old spot here.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.560
And let's say it's
a 30 knot wind.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.160
So the wind's blowing from
the north at 30 knots.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.050
That make sense?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.400
OK.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:19.377
And we want to go south
with a wind true north.

00:40:19.377 --> 00:40:21.710
So now we say, well, what's
the air speed of our Cirrus?

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.950
It's about 150 knots.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.770
And then we can read at
the bottom of our vector,

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:33.100
and now that wind vector
has blown us to 180 knots.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.840
Is everybody happy with that?

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.510
All right.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.120
so We put the dot on the--
and it's explained up here

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.840
at the top.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.200
Zoom in slightly.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.150
OK, let's try some
other situations.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.710
What if we want to go west?

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:06.320
That wind from the north, again,
we put it here on the 180.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.710
Oh, sorry, put it on the 150.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.390
So we're cruising at 150.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.750
So remember I said-- this
is actually reflected here--

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:17.130
that a beam wind is a slight
reduction in ground speed

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.200
because you're also trying
to fly into the wind.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.590
So you can see here,
our ground speed

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:27.420
has been reduced from
150 to about 148 or 147,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.570
and we need a wind correction.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.790
You can see here this
is the 10 degree line,

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:38.262
so we're going to need a wind
correction of about 12 degrees.

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:41.610
So I'll have to steer
right about 12 degrees.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.370
And let's say the wind
was from the south.

00:41:53.328 --> 00:41:55.720
Oh, no, the wind
was from the north.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.130
So if we're trying to go north,
then it becomes really simple.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.310
We put it on 150, and now
we're only going 120 knots.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.520
All right, I think
I survived that.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.200
That was one of my big
fears about this class.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.726
So I learned to do that in--

00:42:17.726 --> 00:42:20.440
oh.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.080
I learned to do that in 2001.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:32.530
In the fall of, I guess,
probably early 2002.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.050
Scary, huh, how
much people forget?

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.270
All right.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.520
I just want to show
you one of these sites.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.590
OK, so here we are in SkyVector.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.010
We can store some flight
plans because I am logged in.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.100
So I'll open an
existing plan, and I'll

00:42:50.100 --> 00:43:00.240
say I want to go from
Bedford to Bennington today

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.720
at 20 Zulu, which is
3 o'clock local time.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.210
So as soon as the class is over,
we teleport to Hanscom Field.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.060
The instructor has already
preflighted the warrior,

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.250
so we jump in and we go.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.030
All right.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.053
So here we have--

00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:17.220
I think you saw this before.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.470
Here are the points
that I picked out

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:28.310
as being maybe easy to recognize
from the air along our trip.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:34.500
And we say, OK, well what's
the weather going to be like?

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:39.230
So we just click here, and
we get an official briefing

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.990
from a flight service station.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.490
Voila.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.260
Oh, special at Bedford.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.210
Winds 180 at 17, gusting 26,
4 statute miles of visibility,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.530
light rain, mist, overcast
800, temperature's 13,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.230
dew point's 12, so that's not
much of a temperature dew point

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.968
split, and sure
enough, the clouds

00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:04.260
are pretty close to the ground.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:04.960
Right?

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.090
With a 1-degree split, you'd
expect the clouds to be close.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.980
Peak wind was 180 at 27.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.090
Look at this terminal forecast.

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.600
The longer the
terminal forecast,

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.480
usually the more
upsetting the weather is.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.960
It's going to be
down to 1 statute

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.700
mile, heavy rain plus
RA, overcast 800,

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.550
and it's going to be gusting 38.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:35.020
That's at 1800 Zulu.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.360
I think we're departing
at 20 Zulu, we said,

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.120
so that's the forecast
for our departure time.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.170
That's not looking so good.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:51.930
The good news is there is
no really upsetting NOTAMs.

00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:57.480
I think this is this
new-- you can look it up

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.940
in the AIM 5/5/5 for the runway
condition code, 100% wet,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.680
but I think that means the
braking action is still

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.297
just fine, as you'd expect
for a groove runway.

00:45:07.297 --> 00:45:08.880
All right, so
everything's good there.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.620
How about Bennington?

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.768
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:15.768 --> 00:45:17.060
PHILIP GREENSPUN: There's what?

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.360
AUDIENCE: There's what
look like [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.235
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh.

00:45:20.235 --> 00:45:21.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.745
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
OK, the student

00:45:22.745 --> 00:45:25.810
asked about the colored
pins, by which I think

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.660
he means the pins of color.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:35.110
So the red is IFR weather
conditions, and the blue,

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.958
I think is, marginal VFR.

00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:39.625
And you can set that
up in these layers.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:48.080
So yeah, see text weather, it's
converting those text weathers

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.020
to graphics.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.520
OK.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.060
Good question.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:56.300
Yeah.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.800
So anyway, it's
kind of an ugly day.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.480
Maybe we want to
fly some other time.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.370
However, we could file the
flight plan if we wanted to.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.082
And it also will give us
this helpful little nav

00:46:08.082 --> 00:46:09.790
log here that we can
use in the aircraft.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:14.100
So all that hard work that
we were doing with the E6B

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.050
can be done for us free and very
easily and very conveniently

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.420
with just a couple
clicks on SkyVector.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:27.510
I see that Tina's here, so
she's a huge ForeFlight plan.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.010
Where?

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.290
Oh, yeah.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:28.920
There she is.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.587
So Tina will tell
you, maybe it would've

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:34.040
been even easier on ForeFlight.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.160
But SkyVector does many
fewer things than ForeFlight,

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.610
and therefore, the
interface is simpler.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.220
And of course, the ForeFlight
folks will be here at 3:00

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.530
and I'm sure they'll
tell you why ForeFlight's

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.460
better than SkyVector.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:50.670
All right.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.295
Let's go back to the
presentation here.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.700
These are just some
of my favorites.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.280
Like I said, there's a
whole ton of these apps.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:02.780
Question?

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.220
AUDIENCE: How do you
file a flight plan?

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.040
Are you just printing it out,
or do you send it to someone?

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.165
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh, yeah.

00:47:09.165 --> 00:47:11.550
The question is, what does it
mean to file a flight plan?

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.470
So the FAA has these computer
systems, these old mainframes,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.130
I think.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.040
For a while, they had
Philips mainframe computers.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.510
You may not have
heard of Philips

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.598
as a popular vendor
of computer systems.

00:47:24.598 --> 00:47:26.640
That's because they exited
the business, I think,

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.950
in the late '60s or early '70s.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.330
But the FAA had
all this software

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.910
that was running in
Philips machine code.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.630
So they were emulating
the Philips mainframes

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:42.218
on more modern systems right
up into the 2000s at least.

00:47:42.218 --> 00:47:44.010
I'm not sure if it's
still that old Philips

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.700
code that takes your flight
plan, but something similar.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.210
So your flight plan gets sent
from whatever application

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:54.030
you're using, I think,
to maybe Lighthouse,

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.660
the Lockheed Martin
spinoff contractor that

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.700
took over flight service
in 2005, I believe it was.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.160
And from there, it goes into
some FAA computer system

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.603
and it's accessible
to the controllers.

00:48:08.603 --> 00:48:10.020
If it's an instrument
flight plan,

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.800
they'll develop a route for you.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.900
If it's just a VFR flight
plan, point to point,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.790
and you're going to activate
it and deactivate it manually,

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.670
it may stay with the
flight service station

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.680
because the controllers
have no reason

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.990
to know about that or care.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.047
Does that answer your question?

00:48:27.047 --> 00:48:29.130
Yeah, so there's a whole
bunch of different places

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.150
that can enter the flight plan.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.070
Where it gets more
complicated and where

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.130
I think an application
like ForeFlight

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.070
might come in very handy
is international flying.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.020
So if you go to
Mexico or something,

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.170
you end up physically walking
over to the control tower

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.730
and there's people
who help you there.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.470
They fill out the forms on
paper and it's kind of fun.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.170
You've got to budget
an extra half hour

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.633
before every departure to
fill out all the paperwork,

00:48:54.633 --> 00:48:55.800
but they're all nice people.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.578
AUDIENCE: So if you had to call
in your flight plane, which

00:48:58.578 --> 00:49:00.870
happens more than you would
expect because you could be

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:04.794
out in the wilderness
with no internet,

00:49:04.794 --> 00:49:06.336
what information do
you provide then?

00:49:06.336 --> 00:49:07.294
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:49:07.294 --> 00:49:09.780
The question is, what if you
have to call in on the radio

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.580
your flight plan to the
flight service station?

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.413
What do you provide?

00:49:12.413 --> 00:49:14.570
Basically, they'll
prompt you if need be,

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:16.620
but some people, on their
kneeboard or whatever,

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.680
will have the elements
of a flight plan.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.650
And you just read out the
same as the flight plan form,

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:31.410
where you want to go, what
your registration number

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:35.760
is, 707 Whiskey Tango, your
type, SR20 slash Golf, how

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.755
many souls onboard,
how much fuel you have,

00:49:37.755 --> 00:49:38.630
all that other stuff.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:40.260
And they enter it in
the system just as

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.552
if you've done it on the phone.

00:49:41.552 --> 00:49:44.490
You can also do it by calling
that 1-800-WX-BRIEF number.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.540
You can do everything by phone.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.400
Question?

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.280
No.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.850
All right, let's see what
else we've got in here.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.090
Suggested reading--
so FAR 61 and 91

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:59.170
is the stuff that you're
going to be tested on,

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:04.980
but it might not be the
best plan for prudence.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.370
So for example, in Canada,
you need special training

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:09.780
and an endorsement at least.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.580
I think it might be a rating.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.230
You need special
training and, I think,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.020
a rating to fly at night VFR.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.970
In some countries,
VFR flight at night

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.220
is just simply unauthorized.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.890
As Tina mentioned, you
have to file IFR, I think,

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.185
if you want to go flying
around at night in Mexico.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.170
For FAR 135, they say, look,
you can't fly single pilot

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.090
IFR with no autopilot.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.298
You have to have some way of
taking your hands off and not

00:50:39.298 --> 00:50:41.340
having the airplane go
upside down in the clouds.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:48.860
Yeah, so just look at those
operating limitations.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.080
And when you're doing your
flight plan, just ask yourself,

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.960
should I be doing something that
is more aggressive than what

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.620
the charter and the airline
crews are permitted to do?

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.608
All right, so we
can take questions.

00:51:03.608 --> 00:51:05.400
And meanwhile, I'll
show you-- while you're

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.020
thinking of your questions,
here is the planning.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.770
Well, it doesn't really
show the planning,

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:13.978
I guess some of the planning.

00:51:13.978 --> 00:51:17.780
We had to load up this
Pilatus with 60 sea turtles.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.632
I think that was late
November or early December.

00:51:21.632 --> 00:51:24.090
So you can see, there they are
in the back of the airplane.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.290
They're in these
Chiquita banana boxes.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.740
Here is a Garmin 650 in the
front of the airplane showing

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.470
that we're just entering
Virginia, I believe,

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.840
and we still have two
hours to go before we

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.750
get to Panama City, Florida.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.910
We're getting 281 knots
over the ground, which

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:42.200
is a little bit of a tailwind.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.660
That's unusual going to Florida.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.050
When we get there, we get
treated like rock stars.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.540
There's a TV station there.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.350
The turtles are here
being transferred,

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:57.393
and there's our
cockpit at night.

00:51:57.393 --> 00:51:58.310
We flew back at night.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:02.180
It was kind of a long
day, maybe 7:00 AM to 9:00

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.680
PM or something.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.610
And there's one of our
sea turtle friends.

[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:05.796
[CLICKING]

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.530
JONATHAN GRUBER: So let's
continue our discussion

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.630
of welfare economics.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.455
Just to review where
we are, the first set

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.830
of lectures in the course were
about positive economics--

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.790
about understanding where supply
and demand curves come from

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.230
and what they mean.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.270
Now, last lecture,
we turned from

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.000
positive to normative
economics and actually making

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.820
judgments about whether
things are good or bad.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.655
And we introduced the concept
of welfare, economic welfare

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.810
or well-being.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.240
And we talked about
consumer surplus, which

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.180
is a measure of how well-off
consumers are made by a given

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
exchange of goods and services,
and producer surplus--

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.160
how well-off produces are made.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.280
We're going to start our lecture
by proving what's modestly

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.320
called the first fundamental
theorem of welfare

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.840
economics, which is that
competition maximizes welfare.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.170
So this is basically taking
our positive economics

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.830
and meeting our
normative economics.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.230
That is, we are going
to talk about how

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.880
the model we've
derived so far, which

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280
is the equilibrium under
perfect competition,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.830
happens to also be
the outcome that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.792
delivers the maximum
well-being to society.

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.230
So let's step back.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.960
Well-being we called welfare.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.850
How do we define the
well-being of society?

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.180
Well, we're going to start
with a simple definition, which

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.590
is we're going to at least
say that social welfare--

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.140
social welfare, the total
welfare of society--

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.730
is simply consumer surplus
plus producer surplus.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.980
That is, we're not going to
put any different weights.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.230
We're not going to say we like
somebody better than another.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.813
We're just going to
say, look, surplus

00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:51.320
is produced by a transaction.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.007
And we just care about the
total surplus that's produced.

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.090
And later, we can come to
help you about consumers

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.538
versus producers, and we will.

00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:01.080
But right now, let's just say
we care about the total surplus

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.100
that's produced for society.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.092
How much benefit is produced
by this transaction?

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:09.050
Well, the benefits produced
by this transaction

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.320
is going to be the surplus
generated for consumers

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.200
by that transaction and the
surplus generated for producers

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.640
by that transaction.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.100
So our total measure
of social well-being

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.840
is going to be the sum of
consumer and producer surplus.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.425
And we are going to prove--

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.050
as I said, you don't
need to know this.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.690
But in [INAUDIBLE] it's called
the first fundamental theorem

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.260
of welfare economics, which
is that under the assumptions

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.700
we've made-- which are many--

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.460
under the assumptions
we've made,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.870
the competitive equilibrium
where supply equals demand

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.150
is the point that
maximizes social welfare.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.840
That is, the key insight is the
point that the market naturally

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.130
delivers.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.920
The equilibrium that's gained
by the market naturally

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.710
happens to be the point
that also makes society

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.810
as well off as possible--

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.660
a very profound result. That
is, the positive conclusion,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.160
which is that supply
and demand will

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.440
meet at a certain
equilibrium, delivers

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.290
a normative conclusion,
which is that equilibrium

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.450
is the point which
maximizes social welfare.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.280
Now, the best way to see
this is just graphically.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.405
So let's go to Figure 10-1.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.030
Figure 10-1 has supply
and demand curve.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.000
Once again, whether these
are curved or linear,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.573
it's still the basic idea
of supply and demand curve.

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:29.990
So curve, supply
and demand curve,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.310
are things which are more
constant elasticity type

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.810
curves.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.440
But that doesn't really
affect the intuition.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.100
We have here the triangles of
consumer surplus and producer

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.620
surplus.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.560
So consumer surplus--
give me the letter.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.590
Somebody raise their
hand and tell me

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.560
which letters on this diagram
correspond to consumer surplus,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.820
and why.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.882
Which areas denoted by
which letters correspond

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.090
to consumer surplus, and why?

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.850
Yeah?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.700
AUDIENCE: R and v.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.450
JONATHAN GRUBER: R and
v. And why is that?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.530
AUDIENCE: Because the price is--

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.760
it really [INAUDIBLE]
here in between the supply

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.718
and demand [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:07.760
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.178
Everything below
the demand curve

00:04:09.178 --> 00:04:10.720
and above the price
consumer surplus.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.280
So, r plus v. So therefore,
what's producer surplus?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.089
Same person.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.089
AUDIENCE: S, t, and u.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.253
JONATHAN GRUBER: S plus t
plus u is producer surplus.

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:23.295
So, consumer surplus-- r
plus v. Producer surplus

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:24.590
is s plus t plus u.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.920
You can see, those of you
who are graphically oriented,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.520
can immediately see the
sum of those two triangles

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.880
will be maximized at the
intersection of the curves

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.730
and nowhere else.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.210
So for example, let's think
about the case where I say,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.820
well, look, it's a shame
the price is that high.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.770
We ought to make
the price lower.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.775
Let's set a new price.

00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.828
So let's have the government
mandate a new price at P2.

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:56.620
Suppose the government
intervenes and says,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.778
we're going to set
a price ceiling.

00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:00.820
We're going to say no one
can charge more than P2

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.890
for their product.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.430
And won't that be a good
thing because the consumers

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.222
will be better off?

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:06.400
They'll pay lower prices.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.040
Well, what does that do?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.960
What does that do
to consumer surplus?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.840
Well, consumer surplus used to
be r plus v. It instead becomes

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.670
r plus s, which is bigger.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.230
Consumer surplus rises.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:31.010
You lose the triangle v, and
you gain the rectangle s.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.550
But the key point is
at the price P2, yeah,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.190
that becomes the new
consumer surplus.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.120
The new producer
surplus is what?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.180
At that price P2, what's
the new producer surplus?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.070
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.260
Yeah?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.640
It's t.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.480
It drops to t.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.880
Producers just get below the
price above the supply curve.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.670
So what has happened to
total social welfare?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.910
It has fallen by
the amount v plus u.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.530
Total social welfare
has fallen by v plus u.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.650
So in some sense, two
things have happened here.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.240
We've set this price.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.730
The first is a transfer.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.490
We have transferred
the rectangle

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.280
s from producers to consumers.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.290
s used to be part
of producer surplus.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.958
We're now giving
it to consumers.

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.500
So first thing we
have is a transfer.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.360
That was probably the
idea of this policy--

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.865
make consumers better off.

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:36.240
So we transferred
what used to be

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.490
producer surplus to consumers.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.975
That's the rectangle s.

00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:40.600
That's the first
thing that's happened.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.310
So thing one that's
happened is a transfer of s.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.260
But the second thing
that's happened

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:57.130
is we have created what we call
a deadweight loss of u plus v--

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.570
a deadweight loss
of u plus v. DWL--

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.810
Deadweight Loss.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.490
What is a deadweight loss?

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.970
That is the net
reduction in welfare

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.810
from trades that are not made.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.490
The deadweight loss-- this is a
key concept we'll come back to,

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.460
and I'll expect you
know it in your sleep.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.170
It's that deadweight loss is the
net reduction in social welfare

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.220
from trades that are not made.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.700
The intuition here is
that every trade that

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.910
makes at least one
party better off

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.280
without making the
other party worse off

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.490
is a good trade to do.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.290
Under the assumption
we've made so far,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.860
if you ever trade that increased
consumer surplus or producer

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.110
surplus or both, that's
a good thing to have.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.750
Right?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.780
If my daughter has any song she
wants to buy by Kendrick Lamar

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.330
that she values at
more than $1.00--

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.570
she gets them for $1.00--

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.445
anything which stops her from
buying those songs is bad.

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:58.320
She's losing surplus.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.950
So basically, the key point
is that deadweight loss

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.990
is an inefficiency.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.600
We talked about how
competition leads

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.960
to maximally efficient
production through cost

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.010
minimization.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.180
Competition also leads to
the maximum welfare outcome

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.440
because that point is the point
which makes society best off,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.940
defined as the sum of consumer
surplus plus producer surplus.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.370
But once again, I cannot
highlight enough the depth

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.900
of this insight.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.505
That this point which before
today, you knew as the outcome.

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:36.880
I showed you in
the first lecture

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.088
this is what happens when
you have supply and demand.

00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:41.620
You get to this equilibrium
that happens to be

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.550
the very best place to be.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.940
And that's why we call it the
first fundamental theorem.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.190
It's very important.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.176
Yeah?

00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:52.140
AUDIENCE: But the idea
then of since we're

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.380
caring about social worth, even
though the consumers are better

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.710
off, there is not as many
trades because the consumers

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.653
don't get as much out of it?

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: I
want to come to that.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.050
Let's talk about that.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.008
Let's go to another
example to talk about that.

00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:04.400
Let's talk about interventions.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.240
Let's do it.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.940
Let's do an example.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.690
That was just to teach
you the basic idea,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.850
but let's go on to a
more explicit example

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.607
of a government intervention.

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:13.690
Actually, I'll do it here.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.030
Let me do an explicit example
of a government intervention.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.447
And that will
address the question

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:29.060
which was just asked because I
skipped over a key point, here.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.420
I'm always not sure the right
order to teach these things.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.100
So let's take
example of a market.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.010
Let's consider the
market for gas.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.250
So go to Figure 10-2.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.800
This is a market we talked about
before, the market for gas.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.080
Imagine the market
for gas is initially

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.300
in equilibrium with supply
curve S1 and a demand curve D.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.680
And it's initially in
equilibrium at point little e1,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.960
with Q1 gallons of gas
being sold at a price P1.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.510
That's initial equilibrium.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.645
Now, imagine that
there is an oil crisis

00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:08.520
because, for example,
the oil company decided

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.610
it would be good
idea to drill eight

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.050
miles underground horizontally.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.240
And it busts, and
there are spills

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.770
everywhere--
something like that,

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.930
some random example like that.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.240
And there's a supply crisis.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.580
What happens now is
suddenly, it gets

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.130
more expensive to produce gas.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.930
So the supply curve
shifts upwards--

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.250
we talked about this last time--

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.463
leading us to a new
equilibrium at point E2.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.005
And you remember,
we talked about how

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:32.930
the equilibrium works.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.910
Initially, if we think
about it in steps,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.280
initially you've
created an excess demand

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.780
because gas companies
no longer want

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:46.130
to supply Q1 gallons at a price
P1 from their new supply curve.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.620
So you shift along
the demand curve

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.020
to the new point E2, which
is a new equilibrium.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.730
And all is well and good.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.840
Prices go up.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.920
That's what happened after Deep
Water and things like that.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.330
Now, imagine the government
doesn't like that.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.630
Imagine the government says,
well, we don't like that.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.460
We don't like the fact consumers
have to pay more for gas.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.960
Consumers vote us
out of office when

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.640
they have to pay more for gas.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.820
So we are going to solve this
by imposing a price ceiling.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.560
We are going to announce
the price of gas

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.215
must remain at its old level P1.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:21.060
So let's go to Figure 10-3.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.058
Figure 10-3 shows what happens
when the government imposes

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:27.850
that price ceiling.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.340
Well, the first question
is if the government

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.610
imposes a price ceiling
of P1, how much actually

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.780
gets sold in the market?

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.580
This comes to the question
that was just asked.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.340
Well, this is sort of a
new thing we've looked at,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.060
which is we have the situation
where there's excess demand.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.390
At the price P1, consumers
still want Q little d.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.050
But suppliers are only willing
to supply Qs, Q little s.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.890
See?

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.450
Consumers still are working
off the same demand curve.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.020
If the government says we
still want the price to be P1,

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.520
they're like, great.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.312
We still want as much
gas as we had before.

00:12:05.312 --> 00:12:06.482
Supplies are like, no way.

00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:07.690
We're not going to supply it.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.950
If you're going to keep
the price at that level,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.080
we're going to produce
less gas because we

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.560
have a rising marginal cost.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.560
So if you're going to
force out that same price,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.870
we're going to work our way
back down the supply curve

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.370
and produce less gas.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.660
So suddenly, you have a
situation of excess demand

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.898
that doesn't get resolved.

00:12:23.898 --> 00:12:26.190
Remember, last time, we said
excess demand got resolved

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.440
by moving up the demand curve.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.483
Well, you can't, here.

00:12:28.483 --> 00:12:30.150
You can't resolve
that because the price

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.510
is forced to be at P1.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.080
Now, what determines what
actually gets sold when

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.500
there's a price restriction?

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.610
Here's the way I
like to think of it.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.660
I like to think of the
actual quantity gets

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.910
set by the constrained party.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.850
So in this case, a
price ceiling means

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.910
that suppliers want
or are asked to supply

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.280
more than they're willing
to, so they just say no.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.150
So you actually get the ultimate
quantity in the market is Qs.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.640
It doesn't matter that
demanders want Qd.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.920
They can't buy stuff
that's not produced.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.390
Likewise, we'll
do examples later

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:10.950
with a price floor,
where consumers want less

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.590
than suppliers want to provide.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.068
Then, it's consumers that
decide what gets sold.

00:13:15.068 --> 00:13:16.610
So basically, whoever
wants less gets

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.380
to decide because
you can't force

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.680
the producers to produce more.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.310
We have a private oil
industry, gas industry.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:28.370
So you end up with Qs units
of gas sold at a price P1.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:34.110
So what the price ceiling does
is move you from E1 to E3.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.980
You would have moved to
E2 without the government

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.910
intervention.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.290
Instead, it moves you to E3.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.510
And as a result, you
end up with consumers--

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:55.130
consumer surplus-- being A plus
C, producer surplus being E,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.898
and relative to an
unconstrained world,

00:13:56.898 --> 00:13:58.940
not relative to the world
before, but relative to

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.540
without government
intervention, you

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.883
have a deadweight loss
of B plus D. Yeah?

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:05.565
AUDIENCE: Why can't [INAUDIBLE]
by producing stuff yourself?

00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:07.690
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's a very deep question.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.340
As I said, that we don't have
a nationalized gas industry.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.840
We just have a
private gas industry.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.280
There's a separate issue of--

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.100
a larger issue about whether
private or public sector

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.420
should be producing things.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.837
And that's beyond the scope
of what we're discussing here.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.462
But for now, assume
the government just

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:22.690
has a regulatory role,
not a gas production role.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.530
The government, by
the way, does have

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.490
a little of a gas
production role

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.540
because the government
actually has something called

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.480
the Strategic Oil Reserve where
they have millions of barrels

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.825
they can actually
release and release

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:32.200
onto the market
at certain times.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.370
The government does have a
way to try to deal with this.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.120
But for now, let's
assume that they're not

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.490
going to use the Strategic
Reserve, just regulate price.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.590
So they regulate price.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.660
And what they've done is they've
created a deadweight loss.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.480
So basically, if
we think about it,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.140
what are the costs and benefits
of government intervention?

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.740
The costs of government
intervention are twofold.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.420
What are the costs of
this price ceiling?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.170
There's two costs.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:05.890
Cost one is you've
created an inefficiency.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.390
You've just created
this deadweight loss

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.550
because basically, if you
didn't restrict things,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.360
there are people who
would have bought gas

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.440
to the right of Q sub S
and to the left of E2.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.080
Those units between
Q sub S and E2,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.570
where E2 intersects
the x-axis, those

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.310
are units where the consumer
surplus plus the producer

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.770
surplus is positive.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.280
Right?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.280
You look at the unit right
to the right of Q sub

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.330
S. That's a unit that consumers
would have happily bought

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.820
at the new higher price and
producers would have happily

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.820
sold at the new higher
price, but the government

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.090
isn't letting it happen.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.290
So that's a deadweight loss.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.720
So that's an inefficiency.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.410
So that's the first cost--

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.260
the cost to society of
trades that don't get made.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:59.070
And we call this
an efficiency loss

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.220
because there are
efficient trades.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.560
Things are efficient
if they make

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.745
the whole-- the joint surplus
is positive, if on net, people

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:08.370
are better off.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.680
They're efficient trades which
both sides were happy to make,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.620
and they can't make.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.380
So we call this an
efficiency loss.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.650
But that's not the only
cost to this policy.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.670
What's the other cost?

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.100
This is a hard question.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.948
Yeah?

00:16:23.948 --> 00:16:25.990
AUDIENCE: Do we have to
force the price to not be

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.990
[INAUDIBLE] what
it'd normally be?

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.920
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
so there's enforcement.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.420
You have to go around and
send regulators around

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.440
to gas stations,
make sure they're

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.970
not charging the wrong price.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:33.720
That's true.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.543
I sort of say that's small.

00:16:35.543 --> 00:16:37.710
Let's think more of a
theoretical-- not theoretical,

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.930
but what's the other
big source of--

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.550
yeah?

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.120
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
the loss to producers?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.885
There's no new producers
wanting to innovate

00:16:43.885 --> 00:16:44.360
and stuff like that?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.390
JONATHAN GRUBER: There's
sort of a dynamic.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.410
But once again,
the producers think

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.700
this may be a short-run thing.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.640
And once the Deepwater
Horizon gets fixed,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.030
prices will be back
down or whatever.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.837
But what's the other miracle of
the market that we lose here?

00:16:57.837 --> 00:16:59.670
We talked about this
the very first lecture.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.140
Yeah?

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.057
AUDIENCE: It felt like,
related to [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:02.057 --> 00:17:03.280
entering and exiting?

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: No,
there's entry and exit.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.880
But once again, let's rule out
[INAUDIBLE] because it's just

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.050
a short-run deal.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.224
Yeah?

00:17:08.224 --> 00:17:10.864
AUDIENCE: Is it like how do
you ensure that the people who

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:11.755
value it the most--

00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:12.630
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.630
There is allocative
inefficiency.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.089
Remember, one of the
things we talked about

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.030
in the very first lecture--

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.260
I think we did.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.140
Maybe not.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.670
Anyway, one of the
most important benefits

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.410
of the competitive equilibrium--

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.480
it doesn't just deliver
the right quantity,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.220
it delivers it to the
people who want it the most.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.190
So let's go back to figure 10-2.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.900
It's easy to see there.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.275
If you think about who gets gas
at the initial equilibrium E1.

00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:43.270
And actually, no.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.170
But let's go 10-3.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.100
That's fine.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.100
So let's say we
hadn't interfered,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.840
and we'd allowed the
price to go to E2.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.200
Well, fewer people would
have bought gas, right?

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.876
The quantity would
have fallen from Qd--

00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:59.560
would have fallen all
the way from E1 to E2.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.020
But the people who dropped
out would have been who?

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.750
The people who
valued gas the least,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.760
the people who got the
lowest surplus from it.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:15.060
However, now, suddenly, you
only have Qs units of gas,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.690
and you have Qd
people who want them.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.130
Well now, who decides
who gets them?

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.080
Before, the market
did the magic.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.650
The market made sure the people
who wanted the units got them.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.020
Now, all of a sudden,
something else has to decide.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.700
So how do you resolve this?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.860
Well, we actually
an answer to this.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.840
We had a gas crisis
in the 1970s.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.760
And the government
imposed a price ceiling.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.927
And how did it get resolved?

00:18:36.927 --> 00:18:38.660
How did we decide
then who got the gas?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.780
Does anyone know?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.470
Raise your hand and
tell me if you know.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.106
Yeah?

00:18:42.106 --> 00:18:44.365
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.990
JONATHAN GRUBER:
People waited in line.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.280
People basically sat in their
cars and waited in line.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.610
Now, so essentially,
if you think about it,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.790
goods are going to
get allocated somehow.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.290
If the market doesn't
allocate them,

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.340
there'll be another less
efficient allocation mechanism.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.520
And basically, why
is it inefficient

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.592
that people waited
in line for gas?

00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:11.800
There's actually two reasons.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.390
One is sort of cute.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.640
But what's the main reason
it's inefficient for people

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.400
to be waiting in line for gas?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.550
Yeah?

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.550
AUDIENCE: They're
wasting [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.960
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes,
the opportunity cost.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.030
Point little 1, you have
the opportunity cost.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.670
You have the fact that that
time I spent waiting in line,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.733
I could have been
working or having fun,

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:34.900
but certainly something I
would've enjoyed more than

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900
waiting in line for gas.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.867
I think we'd all
agree that there's

00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:39.700
something we'd rather
be doing with our time

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.370
than waiting in line for gas.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.370
Unless you really like
the music in your car

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.620
stereo, and you can't
listen anywhere else.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.162
I don't know what
the story would be.

00:19:47.162 --> 00:19:49.330
But I can't imagine
that many of us

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.070
would prefer to wait in line
for gas than do something else.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.403
So there's the opportunity cost.

00:19:52.403 --> 00:19:54.370
That's an inefficiency.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.750
Society is losing out because
you are not using your time

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.670
in the most productive way--

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.370
in the way that
maximizes your welfare.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.870
What else?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.780
What's the other
small, other cost?

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.280
Yeah?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.155
AUDIENCE: Isn't waiting
in line [INAUDIBLE]??

00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:12.670
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, people
used gas waiting in line.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.268
So there's literally the
technical inefficiency.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.437
And remember, this is back
when cars got like 8 miles

00:20:20.437 --> 00:20:21.020
to the gallon.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.340
So you'd get to the
front line, get gas,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.450
and have to go back to
the back of the line

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.072
again because you
used so much gas,

00:20:25.072 --> 00:20:26.780
plus not to mention
the pollution and all

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.070
that other stuff.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.770
So basically, this
is the inefficiency

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.903
from a non-market
allocation mechanism, which

00:20:34.903 --> 00:20:37.070
is that people could be
doing more productive things

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.170
and not wasting gas
waiting in line.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.723
Yeah?

00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:43.660
AUDIENCE: Is the excess
of demand Qs minus Qd,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.810
or Qs minus E2?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, Qd--

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.350
because we fixed the price
of P1, so it's Qd minus--

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.180
since we fixed the price
of P1, people want--

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.245
what's the demand at that price?

00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:56.870
Qd, but it's supplied
at that price Qs.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.950
So that's the excess demand.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.870
So now, yeah?

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.070
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
how the market makes sure

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.112
that people who want the
gas the most can get it.

00:21:06.112 --> 00:21:08.768
But isn't the one thing it
involves like however much

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.060
they're willing to spend on it?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.250
So does this market
assume that all people

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.700
make the same amount of income?

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.033
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, it doesn't.

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:18.070
But it does assume that
basically, the market--

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.230
and this comes to the tradeoff.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.600
What's the benefit
of this policy?

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.280
Which you've raised with your
question, which is equity.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.378
I've defined consumer
surplus as simply

00:21:30.378 --> 00:21:31.670
being what the market delivers.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.310
So basically, rich guys
have more consumer surplus

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.680
than poor guys.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.800
That might not seem
fair to people.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.780
As a result, the benefit is
equity, which is that if you--

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.940
that everyone gets
gas at a lower price.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.280
Rather than the price rising,
the people who drop out

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.800
may actually not be the people
who don't need to drive.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.533
They're people who can't afford
to drive, so they drop out.

00:21:54.533 --> 00:21:56.450
Remember, where does the
main curve come from?

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.908
It comes from
utility maximization.

00:21:57.908 --> 00:22:00.230
That's a constrained
maximization.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.920
So the people who drop
out may be people we want.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.720
Maybe they're people who have
to lose their jobs because they

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.310
can't drive to
their jobs anymore.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.600
That's unfortunate.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.510
So basically, the benefit
of this is equity.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.150
And that raises something
we're going to come back

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.900
to over and over again in this
class, which is what we call

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.113
the equity-efficiency tradeoff.

00:22:21.113 --> 00:22:23.030
The equity-efficiency
tradeoff, which is there

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.410
are many government policies
which make society more equal,

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.595
but along the way
deliver deadweight loss.

00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:32.470
And I'll actually tell
you later in the class

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.340
how to optimize
across that problem--

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.150
how to optimize across the
tradeoff between equity

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.050
and efficiency.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.050
But for right now, I just
need you to understand

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.310
that there's a tradeoff.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.840
Yeah?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] equity.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.753
Like [INAUDIBLE] let the
people who [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:50.753 --> 00:22:52.910
because if there's
no price ceiling,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.190
then the people who are
able to pay the most money

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.178
will get it, right?

00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:57.470
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.370
So the point is--

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.370
right, the people who--
was there more to your--

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.953
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:03.090
But if there's a
price ceiling, then

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.968
wouldn't it just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.010
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.130
At issue is a different
kind of inequity.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.322
So if you're worried about--

00:23:11.322 --> 00:23:13.280
so in some sense, the
rich guy would say, well,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.170
that's not fair to
me, Just because I've

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.450
got a productive job
I could be doing.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.450
And someone else has extra time.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.200
Why should they get
the gas instead of me?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.867
So you're right.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:24.135
There's always an inequity.

00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:25.010
That's a great point.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.205
When I say "equity," I
implicitly mean what we call--

00:23:28.205 --> 00:23:29.580
ethics is a very
important point.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.670
Whenever I say equity
in this course,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:37.280
I implicitly mean what
we call vertical equity.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.800
Vertical equity is
rich versus poor.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.350
There are other kinds of
equity you might care about

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:49.910
like who has extra time versus
who doesn't have extra time.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.990
And that's a good point.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.000
But for now, when
I say equity, I'm

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.960
only thinking about
rich versus poor.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.690
When we're thinking
about government policy

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.240
and the equity-efficiency
tradeoff,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.570
we're really thinking
about vertical equity.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.613
Other questions about that?

00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:03.030
So let's do a
couple more examples

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.370
to drill this intuition home.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.330
Let's do a couple more
examples because this

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.760
is a very important point.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.220
Example A-- let's talk
about ticket scalping.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.690
I love going to music concerts.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.540
I went to my 51st concert
of the year last year--

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.500
last night, sorry.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.530
Went to my 51st
concert of the year.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.238
I love going to music
concerts, so I know

00:24:25.238 --> 00:24:27.240
a lot about the music business.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.220
And ticket scalping at
concerts is a big deal.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.060
For those of you who
don't know the term,

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.760
this is the idea of
buying tickets essentially

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.080
on a secondary market.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.050
So let's use the
example of Adele.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.650
So Adele, about two
years ago, went on tour

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.020
for the first time in
four years to back up

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.455
an incredibly successful album.

00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:46.080
And folks really
wanted to see her life

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.980
because she had a big fan base.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.760
She was quiet for a while.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.630
She made an album.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.580
People really wanted
to see her live.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.100
She wanted to make sure her
fans could afford to see her.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.290
So what she did is
she said, I'm going

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.620
to price many tickets for
$40 and the highest tickets

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.710
at $150, which is
really, really cheap.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.960
So my daughter's going
to see J. Cole tonight.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.180
And she's paying like $150 for a
mediocre ticket, so $40 to $150

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.783
is really cheap.

00:25:11.783 --> 00:25:13.950
But she's saying, I want
to deliver consumer surplus

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.490
to my fans.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.950
I want to make sure
my fans can really

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.290
enjoy this and get surplus.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.850
But what happened?

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.490
Well, what happened is that the
tickets sold out instantly--

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.580
like, literally instantaneously.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.100
And the major
purchasers were what

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.400
we call scalpers, who are
essentially professionals

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.730
who buy tickets and
then resell them on what

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.020
we call the secondary market.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.120
You might have heard of
StubHub or other sites

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.860
like that, where you
essentially go on

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.460
and buy tickets to
sold-out events.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.930
And the prices on
StubHub were much higher.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.200
It was about $1,500
for good ticket--

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.500
about 10 times what
she'd set the price at.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.610
So basically, who's
getting the surplus?

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.550
Not the fans, the scalpers--

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.160
the people who were quick enough
to get online who had bots

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.008
set up, so that the
second it went online,

00:26:04.008 --> 00:26:05.550
they went online
and got the tickets.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.615
They had thousands of
bots set up, essentially.

00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:09.990
Somehow, they got around the
"click this if you're human"

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.490
box.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.820
I don't know how they do that.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.710
But essentially, I'm sure
it's smart programmers.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.377
You guys can probably
do that in an hour

00:26:15.377 --> 00:26:17.300
as an extra-credit project.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.800
They got around it,
and they bought.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.370
And so essentially,
Adele actually

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.415
didn't create
surplus for her fans.

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:24.790
She created surplus
for scalpers.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.290
Now, it didn't used
to be this way.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.970
When I was a kid, we didn't
have a secondary market.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.430
We waited on line.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.570
So when I saw my first
concert in 1981--

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.740
can you guys believe that?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.405
In 1981, I saw The Cars.

00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:43.238
How many of you guys
have heard of The Cars?

00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:45.230
Oh, god.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.070
Anyway, I saw The Cars, and I
had to wait on line for hours

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.640
to get tickets because that
was the allocation mechanism.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.920
So let's think about whether
life is better or worse.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.580
Because on the one hand,
scalpers get money.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.435
On the other hand, people don't
waste time waiting on line.

00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:05.560
So it really comes down to
the same equity tradeoff

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.080
we talked about before.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.580
Now.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.430
As a 16-year-old in
1981, I could not

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.910
have afforded to pay, probably,
the secondary market price.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.620
But as I was 16, I had
nothing do with my time,

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.300
so I was happy to spend
hours waiting on line.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.995
But on the other hand, you could
say someone is very productive,

00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:25.620
who is a big fan who
is very productive

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.030
and could be out
inventing new products

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.520
if they weren't
standing on line.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.228
They might say that's
really inefficient.

00:27:31.228 --> 00:27:33.720
I'm happy to pay $1,500
and spend my time inventing

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.330
new things, rather than have
to sit around waiting on line.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.910
So it's not clear which is the
better or the worse system.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.670
It's hard to say.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.328
Yeah.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.770
So like the demand for
[INAUDIBLE] will be only

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:51.900
changing prices and all--

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.480
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
no, but here's the point--

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.210
that's a great point, which
is that, in some sense,

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.710
what the scalpers do
is undo Adele's action

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.300
and create a truly
efficient market.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.660
So think of the scalpers as
essentially undoing Adele's

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.570
action, which
distorted the market.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.150
So you have a market
for Adele tickets

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.453
which is at
equilibrium at $1,500.

00:28:14.453 --> 00:28:15.870
Adele tried to set
a price ceiling

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.760
at $150, seemingly
selfishly, saying,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.582
I'm going to give up
my surplus for my fans.

00:28:24.582 --> 00:28:26.540
But unfortunately, it
didn't work out that way.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.180
What happened was the market
re-equilibrated at $1,500,

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.880
but that extra surplus
didn't go to Adele.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.180
The consumer surplus still
remained above $1,500.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.728
The difference was that extra
gap between 150 and 1500

00:28:37.728 --> 00:28:38.520
didn't go to Adele.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.740
It went to the scalpers.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.933
So it's probably more
efficient than waiting online,

00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:45.600
because waiting online
has inefficiency,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.690
whereas instantaneous
bidding is more efficient.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.040
But in some sense,
the efficiency gain

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.060
is being delivered not to
consumers, as Adele wanted.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.090
It's being delivered
to scalpers.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.350
So basically, now, there's
another alternative.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.050
What could Adele
have done instead?

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.430
What's another way Adele
could've approached this?

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.130
She could have auctioned
her tickets online.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.012
She could've said,
look, I know that I

00:29:14.012 --> 00:29:15.970
can't manage to deliver
$40 tickets to my fans.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.888
I just can't defeat
the scalper system.

00:29:17.888 --> 00:29:19.680
But why should the
scalpers have the money?

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.690
I'm going to auction my tickets.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.150
And essentially, she could
have set up an efficient market

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.662
online, where people bid.

00:29:25.662 --> 00:29:27.870
And then you would have
gotten the efficient outcome.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:28.710
And you wouldn't wait on line.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.910
You would have bid.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.380
Now, it would've been
inequitable outcome,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.930
but basically, the
same fans would

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.685
have gotten the tickets as in
the end got them from scalpers.

00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:38.560
But instead of paying
$1,500 to the scalpers,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.760
they'd pay $1,500 to Adele.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.720
And probably that's
a better outcome.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.760
I mean, Adele doesn't
need the money,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.378
but at the end of
the day, if Adele's

00:29:46.378 --> 00:29:48.420
generating that amount of
goodwill from her fans,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.750
it seems like she should get the
money, not a bunch of scalpers.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.750
So I guess probably I'd
rather have her have it

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.170
than the scalpers.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.330
Now, Ticketmasters tried
to set up auction systems,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.250
recognizing this problem, and
they're not really taking off.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.800
And it sort of
speaks to the fact

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.110
that people don't really like
to think about economics.

00:30:09.752 --> 00:30:12.210
That basically, people were
like, yeah, but if you auction,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.377
that's ripping off the fans.

00:30:13.377 --> 00:30:14.250
That's no fair.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.210
And Ticketmasters
would say, well,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.950
you're getting ripped off
anyway, just by scalpers.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.960
And they said, no, I can
still get online first

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.650
and get my ticket.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.600
And people just didn't like
it, thought it was unfair,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.490
even though it's almost
certainly a better outcome

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.615
for society that Adele
should have the money rather

00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:26.520
than the scalpers.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.390
Which speaks to the fact that
morals matter in markets.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.450
We like the way these markets
abstract amoral concepts,

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.030
but morals do matter.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.400
And that basically,
it sort of matters

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.050
you sometimes can't do the
right thing because it might not

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.030
be the thing that
makes consumers

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.720
willing to participate.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.610
So that's one example, scalping.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.660
Another example-- food banks.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.750
Food banks are
organizations which

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.140
provide-- oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.347
AUDIENCE: What if you
force everyone, I mean,

00:31:02.347 --> 00:31:04.930
when you buy a ticket you have
to put your name on the ticket,

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.062
so that only you--

00:31:07.062 --> 00:31:08.770
JONATHAN GRUBER: I've
thought about that.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.140
So if I could do anything
I wanted in life,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.590
I'd be a rock star.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.798
And I thought if I was a
rock star, it would be cool.

00:31:16.798 --> 00:31:19.000
I'd have a concert
for my mega fans,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.753
where they'd have to
prove who they were,

00:31:20.753 --> 00:31:22.170
and I'd have a
bracelet and stuff.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.030
It just seems like
it's too hard.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.140
It seems the technology
is just too hard.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.030
So actually, there's
a really cool example.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.447
So I was on the
phone this morning

00:31:29.447 --> 00:31:33.630
with rock and roll promoter
who's doing a super cool thing.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.390
So as the election approaches,
I will nag you guys to vote.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.210
Voter turnout among the young
is an enormous problem the US.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.220
So she is running a
series of concerts

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.640
around the country where if
you show a picture of yourself

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.130
outside a polling place,
you get into the concert

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.653
for free, to try to promote
voting among young people.

00:31:49.653 --> 00:31:50.320
It's super cool.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.240
It's called "I voted."

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.080
You can look it up on the web.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.800
It's kind of a cool thing.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.633
There's a couple of
concerts here in Boston.

00:31:54.633 --> 00:31:55.940
They're all over the country.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.690
So you could think
about things like that.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.820
The question is ultimately, do
people Photoshop their picture

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.070
in front of the polling place?

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.690
It's all just a
question of enforcement.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.540
Let's talk about food banks.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.910
So basically,
these organizations

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.310
provide free food to the poor.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.770
And the biggest one is
called "Feeding America."

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.500
Feeding America has food
banks all over the nation,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.960
and they provide free
food to the poor.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.000
Now, their goal,
then, is they have

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.330
to figure out where to
send the food to get it

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.470
to people who need it the most.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.630
Now, a market does
this naturally.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.490
Basically, if people
want more turkey

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.340
in location A, then all of a
sudden, the price for turkey

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.930
goes up.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.950
All of a sudden, the
store runs out of turkey.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.742
It says, wow, I can
charge more for turkey.

00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:42.640
It raises the price, and
it equilibrates the market.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.180
So a market solves for
sending the right food

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.500
to where people want it.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.050
But the problem
with Feeding America

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.170
is that they didn't
have that market.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.920
So they had to decide
where to send stuff.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.753
And they'd screw up.

00:32:54.753 --> 00:32:57.280
They'd send potatoes to
Idaho, where they're drowning

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.190
in potatoes, stuff like that.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.027
So it was very hard
for them to figure out

00:33:03.027 --> 00:33:05.110
where to send the food
exactly where people wanted

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.628
it the most, because they didn't
have the market mechanism.

00:33:07.628 --> 00:33:09.170
They wanted to give
it away for free.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.560
That defeats the purpose
if they charge for it.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.180
But they didn't
really know, they

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.100
didn't have the
market to tell them

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.770
where folks wanted which foods.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.520
In the real market,
if you want real food,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.630
you bit the price up.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.530
In their market, you couldn't.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.150
So Feeding America came up
with a really clever solution.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.960
They made a virtual market.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.970
They said to each
food bank, we are

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:35.280
going to give you a fake
budget of x $100,000,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.120
and you bid for which foods
you want based on what

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.010
the people in your area want.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.190
And we'll then allocate it
according to those bids.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.610
So they got the market mechanism
working without the food banks

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.500
having to actually
give any money.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.830
So in that way, they
massively reallocated food.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.840
They suddenly said,
hey, the one from Idaho

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.840
is bidding really high
for turkey and not at all

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.390
for potatoes.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.760
Maybe we should send them
more turkey and the potatoes

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.900
elsewhere.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.910
So they essentially
got market signals

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.990
from a non-financial
transaction.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.929
It was a super cool idea.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.300
And it was a huge benefit.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.550
They were able to
effectively allocate

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.270
about 50 million pounds of
food through this mechanism,

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.822
making sure that food got
to the folks that needed it.

00:34:19.822 --> 00:34:21.739
So there's an example
how you can use a market

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:25.040
mechanism without actually--
while not violating equity.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.290
The food was always
free, but by setting up

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.810
these virtual
prices, they managed

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.607
to get the food
delivered to where

00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:32.690
people wanted it the most.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.610
They let the market send
its allocative signals.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.052
They let the market be
allocatively efficient,

00:34:38.052 --> 00:34:39.510
send signals of
where people wanted

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.005
the food, without
actually violating equity.

00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:43.880
Questions about that?

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:50.010
Now, let's go to the hardest,
but my favorite example, which

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.639
is taxi medallions.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.248
This is a hard example,
but it's a really cool one,

00:34:56.248 --> 00:34:57.540
and it ends with a great story.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.360
Taxicabs-- now, cast
your mind back pre Uber.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.850
Go back 10 years, or even--

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.170
yeah, about 10 years.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.840
Taxicabs were the only way
you could get around town

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.710
if you didn't have--

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.960
if you wanted to get from
point A to point B in a car,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.110
you didn't own one,
you took a taxi.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.290
And this was a great example
of an economist's perfectly

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.903
competitive market, in theory.

00:35:23.903 --> 00:35:26.070
It's identical product--
you want to go from point A

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.620
to point B.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.870
There could be lots of them
riding around the streets.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.328
You can price
compare, because cabs

00:35:32.328 --> 00:35:34.413
are coming by all the time.

00:35:34.413 --> 00:35:36.830
It should have been a very
effective, perfectly efficient,

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.140
perfectly competitive market.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.750
But it wasn't,
because every city

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.640
limited the amount
of taxicabs that

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.830
were allowed in their city.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.860
Every city had a system
where to be a taxicab,

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.962
you had to have what was
called a "medallion."

00:35:52.962 --> 00:35:54.170
It wasn't really a medallion.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.420
It was originally a medallion.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.210
It's just a piece
of paper, actually.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.350
And they regulated the number
of taxicabs allowed in the city.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.847
They said, we're only
going allow x many taxicab

00:36:03.847 --> 00:36:04.680
drivers in the city.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.870
And every city did this.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.570
Now, we're going to do both a
positive and normative analysis

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.030
of this policy.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.130
Let's start with a
positive analysis.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.812
What did this policy do?

00:36:16.812 --> 00:36:18.270
Now I'm going to
go to figure 10-4.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.180
Figure 10-4 will be one of
the most complicated figures

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.020
we do in this class.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.937
I'm going to go through
it as slowly as I can,

00:36:23.937 --> 00:36:26.393
but please stop me
if it's not clear.

00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:28.560
This is one of these figures
we'll go back and forth

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.370
between the two sides.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.190
So on the right-hand
side is the market.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.110
On the left-hand
side is the cab firm.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.875
We're going to start by
assuming all cabs are identical.

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:39.250
We assume all cabs
are identical,

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:44.700
so one representative firm
tells us about every cab firm.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.200
Now, we start with the market.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.570
We have an initial
demand, which is d.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:53.135
The line d, the blue line,
is the demand for taxicabs.

00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:56.280
An initial supply
curve s1, we're

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.150
going to assume
that essentially,

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.850
in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.070
you have a flat, long
run supply curve.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.990
You have perfectly
elastic supply.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.910
Anybody can just grab a
cab and start driving.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.220
Once again, in a cab
market without medallions,

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.640
anyone could throw a
taxi sign on the car

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.110
and start driving around,
picking people up.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.032
So it's effectively
perfectly entry and exit,

00:37:17.032 --> 00:37:19.490
so it's a perfectly competitive
long run market, therefore,

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.520
flat supply at s1.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.120
So the initial equilibrium
is at point big E1.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.380
We have Q1 rides, big
Q1 rides per month.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.910
And that amounts to--

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.680
so you have q.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.710
That's the equilibrium.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.032
Now, how many firms are there?

00:37:37.032 --> 00:37:38.490
Well, we know many
firms there are,

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.470
because we say at that
price, p1, we go to the left.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.770
We know that firms will produce
where marginal cost equals

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.160
the average cost at the minimum
of long run average cost.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.050
We proved that a
couple lectures ago.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.300
Therefore, if the
price is E1, we

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.950
know each efficient firm
will produce little q1.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.440
If each firm's going
to produce little q1,

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.020
and the total amount of
rides is going to be big Q1,

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.210
then that implies
little n1 firms.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.580
So let me go through it again.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.870
Supply equals demand at big Q1.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.330
That gives you a price P1.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.040
Now we shift to the left.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.490
At that price P1, we
know that each firm

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.680
will choose to produce
little q1 rides,

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.930
because that's where price
equals marginal cost equals

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.530
average cost.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.170
Now we go back to the right.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.090
We know if each firm is
providing little q1 rides,

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.790
and you need big Q1, then
there must be N1 firms.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.460
Questions about that?

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.836
That's the initial equilibrium.

00:38:39.836 --> 00:38:45.220
And at that point, there
are long run zero profits.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:49.240
Consumer surplus
is a plus b plus c.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.060
c, by the way, is the
gray area on either side

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.720
of the dashed line.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.230
a plus b plus c, we mark it
twice because it's confusing,

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.620
the dashed line there.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.080
So the blue area, the green
area, and the gray area

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.350
are the consumer surplus.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.853
And what's the producer surplus?

00:39:03.853 --> 00:39:05.020
What's the producer surplus?

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.450
Raise your hand and tell me.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.950
Yeah.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.000
JONATHAN GRUBER: Zero because?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.630
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, there's
no-- in long run equilibrium,

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.460
there's no profits.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.160
In long run equilibrium, price--

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.330
remember, profits are
price minus average cost,

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.180
but price equals average cost.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.490
So there's no profit, so
it's all consumer surplus--

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.742
all well and good.

00:39:24.742 --> 00:39:26.700
Now let's say the government
comes in and says,

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.325
we're going to have
a medallion system.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:40.280
So let's say we're going to
have a system where only little

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.100
n2 cabs are allowed
in the market.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.720
Little n2 are the only number
of cabs allowed in the market.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.610
So what is the new
market supply curve?

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:50.562
Start on the right.

00:39:50.562 --> 00:39:52.020
What's the new
market supply curve?

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.620
Well, up to little n2 times
q1, nothing's changed.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:03.310
Each cab company used to provide
little q1 rides at a price P1.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.610
So up to the point
little n2 little q1,

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.180
we're on the same supply
curve we used to be on.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.380
But then things change.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.730
Why do they change?

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:14.570
Because now, let's say riders
want more than little n2 q1.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.820
Well, you can't deal
with that by entry.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.080
You have to deal with
that by the existing cab

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.320
drivers working more.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.420
But if they work
more, supply curve

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.262
is upward sloping, because now
marginal costs can be rising.

00:40:27.262 --> 00:40:28.720
Before, the reason
the supply curve

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.070
was flat when you went to the
right of little n2 little q1,

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.440
as you moved to the right,
you just got more entry.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.482
And everyone still produces
their efficient level

00:40:37.482 --> 00:40:38.240
of little q1.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.840
Now, when you can't
allow more entry,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.760
firms have to produce more.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.940
And suddenly, they're not at
the cost minimizing point.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.070
They're riding up their
marginal cost curve.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.280
So the supply curve
becomes flat to that point,

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.050
and then becomes upward sloping.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.170
And that's s2.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.380
s2 is the red line that
is flat to the left

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.730
of little n2 little q1, and
then becomes upward sloping.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:08.110
And the new equilibrium
is at point E2.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.590
With n2 firms-- by law, you
can only have n2 firms--

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:16.360
producing little q2 rides each.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.940
And your new
equilibrium is big Q2.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:26.920
And that new
equilibrium price is P2.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.860
The new equilibrium price is P2.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.990
Now P2, if you go to the old--

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:39.490
P2 is the point, if you
look at the price as P2,

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.780
but forget the a c2 curve.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.932
Focus on the a c1 curve.

00:41:43.932 --> 00:41:45.640
The average cost
function hasn't changed.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.960
It's still a c1.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:52.158
So if the price is P2 and the
average cost curve is a c1,

00:41:52.158 --> 00:41:53.950
they're going to produce
where price equals

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.500
marginal cost at little e2.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.900
So let me back up.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.150
Let's go back to the
curve on the right.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.260
The equilibrium is now big E2.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.840
That's at a price little p2.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.550
Now shift to the left.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.700
At a price of little
p2, firms produce where

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.220
price equals marginal cost.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.860
Price equals marginal cost
at a quantity little q2.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.720
So firms produce little
q2, because that's

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.030
the point at which price
equals marginal cost.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.510
They produce at little q2, if
they're making little q2 units

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:29.330
at a price p2, their earning
profits of pi, the shaded area,

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.880
because they are producing units
at price above marginal cost.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.290
And they're producing
little q2 units,

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.790
so every unit they produce,
they're earning profits on.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.890
So the taxi medallion
workers or the taxi companies

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.360
are now making money.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.780
They're making profits.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.504
Questions about that?

00:42:48.504 --> 00:42:49.468
Yeah.

00:42:49.468 --> 00:42:52.133
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
idea that if you allowed

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:54.300
for people, more people to
go then, profits would be

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:54.920
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.460
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, but
they're not allowing them in.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.540
They're making profits.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.890
So imagine where we started
at E2 and allowed free entry.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.950
Then you'd see, basically,
more firms willing to drive

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:05.910
the price down to P1.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.550
But we don't allow
that, so it's profits.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.280
It's a barrier to
entry, which creates

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.543
profits, which breaks us from
our long run flat supply curve.

00:43:14.543 --> 00:43:15.960
We talked about
one of the reasons

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.240
why that loop won't be flat.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.740
So now, let's move
to the normative.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.375
Is this a good idea or not?

00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:24.250
Well, let's look at the
welfare implications.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.130
What's happened?

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.220
What's happened
is consumers used

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.370
to have a surplus
of a plus b plus c.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.497
Now, their surplus is what?

00:43:34.497 --> 00:43:35.830
What's the new consumer surplus?

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.790
Raise their hand and tell me.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.940
Yeah.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.770
AUDIENCE: A.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: Just a, because
the line below the demand

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.480
above price is just a.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.190
Producers used to
have zero surplus.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.580
What's their new surplus?

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.310
Behind you, yeah.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.810
AUDIENCE: B.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.227
JONATHAN GRUBER: B, because
it's the area above the supply

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.830
curve, below the price line.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.360
And c is what?

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.920
The deadweight loss.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.080
Those are transactions
no longer happening--

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.960
the deadweight loss.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.350
So basically, normatively,
you can pose the problem

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.940
as the following--

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:12.470
is it worth society
losing the area c

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:16.580
in order to transfer the
area b from consumers

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.728
to taxicab drivers?

00:44:18.728 --> 00:44:20.520
That's the way to think
about this problem.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.000
Let me say it again.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
It's very important.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.417
Essentially what the government
policy is doing is saying,

00:44:24.417 --> 00:44:27.570
I'm going to transfer
b from consumers

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.970
to producers, even though
it's going to cost me

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.860
c in deadweight loss.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.360
That's what the
government's saying.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.800
That's the
government's position.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.280
Now, why is the
government wrong?

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.590
Why, in fact, is that
not the proper statement

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.860
of what happens?

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.100
It's very complicated.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.470
What does the government
miss when it says,

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.940
I've made the
drivers better off?

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.870
Sure, I've created
deadweight loss,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:54.920
and I make consumers
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.510
but at least I made
these drivers better off.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:57.410
They live terrible lives.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.180
There's articles in the paper
all the time about suicides

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.410
of taxicab drivers.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.040
It's terrible.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:01.640
What did they miss?

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.140
Yeah.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.975
AUDIENCE: The cost
of taxis goes up.

00:45:03.975 --> 00:45:06.350
JONATHAN GRUBER: They've missed
the fact that the taxicab

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:09.308
drivers have to
buy the medallions,

00:45:09.308 --> 00:45:10.850
that the limited
number of medallions

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.680
aren't just given to taxicab
drivers, they're bought.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.630
And the taxicab drivers--

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:21.410
what is a taxicab driver
willing to pay for a medallion?

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.830
They are willing to pay, in
the limit, the total surplus

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:29.040
they get from driving the cab
minus $1 or minus some amount

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.860
that they need to eat.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.650
So if suddenly, in a world
with no restrictions,

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.540
with no taxicab
medallions, if you said

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.540
we need a piece of
paper to drive a taxi,

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.810
but anyone can have it for
free, what would it be worth?

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.340
Zero.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.300
But in a world where you say
if you have this piece of paper

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.210
you can drive, and
drivers earn profits pi,

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:54.130
what will the taxicab
medallions sell for?

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.810
Pi minus some small amount.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.640
So actually, who wins?

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.980
The taxicab medallion owners.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.780
And who are they?

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.910
They are random
folks who happened

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.000
to get these things in
1920 when they were issued,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.180
and their descendants, and
people who bought them.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.660
So this leads to my great story,
the taxicab medallion king

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.587
of Long Island was
a guy who happened

00:46:17.587 --> 00:46:19.420
to have a bunch of these
taxicab medallions.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.753
And as they went through the
roof, they got worth a lot.

00:46:21.753 --> 00:46:27.810
In New York, New York
had 12,000 permits,

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.840
and that number did not
change since they originally

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.475
sold for $10 each in 1937.

00:46:33.475 --> 00:46:35.475
1937, you could have
bought [INAUDIBLE] for $10,

00:46:35.475 --> 00:46:37.770
and they issued 12,000 of them.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.750
They've never increased it.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:45.208
Right now, a taxicab medallion
in New York is worth $400,000.

00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:46.750
The taxicab King of
New York is a guy

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.760
who lives in Long Island who
made so much money that he

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.810
actually, for his
kid's bar mitzvah

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.310
not only had rented out a hotel,
whole basketball-themed bar

00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:00.080
mitzvah, but hired Nicki Minaj.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.460
This was paid for by area b.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.290
This was paid for--
so in fact, it's

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.560
not the taxicab drivers that
make out of this policy.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.950
It's the taxicab medallion
King of New York.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.185
Now, here's what happens--

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.080
what happens, then,
when Uber comes in?

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.950
Who's the big loser?

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.432
Not the taxicab drivers, the
taxicab medallion owners.

00:47:27.432 --> 00:47:29.140
So everyone tells you
Uber is a bad thing

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.210
because these poor taxicab
drivers are starving.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.820
Taxicab drivers were
always starving.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.290
It was always a terrible life.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:40.560
The difference is pricing
medallions is down like 50%.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.647
And I cry no tears for the Nicki
Minaj-hiring class of America.

00:47:45.647 --> 00:47:47.980
So basically, when you think
about people saying Uber is

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.340
bad, it steals jobs from
taxicab drivers, no, it doesn't.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.950
It steals money from
taxicab medallion owners,

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.380
and that is something
we might be OK with.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.050
So feel fine taking your Uber.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.740
It's a great thing.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.830
So let me stop there.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.750
I'm going to come back.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.470
We'll come back next lecture.

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:10.670
And we will start talking about
monopoly, the market structure,

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:12.360
not the game.

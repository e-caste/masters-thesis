00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.600
HUGH MCMANUS: Earl introduced
to you the concept of Lean

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.020
and made the assertion
that lean isn't

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.560
so much a collection of tools as
a way of thinking about things.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.070
So what we're going
to do now, actually,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.370
in two parts, one
before lunch, one after,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.960
is introduce you to the basics
of that way of thinking.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.570
So that's why we call
this module Lean Thinking.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.210
What we're going to do first
is talk about processes.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.090
And if Lean thinking has one
really important component,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.730
if you walk away from here
with one idea in your head,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.760
it's to think about
work as a process which

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.030
can be improved, so we're going
to spend a little bit of time

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.590
thinking about
what is a process,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950
how can we think about
processes, how can we map

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.090
processes, how can we create
visual representations of them,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.150
and how we can think about
value in that context.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.310
We're going to look at
the fundamental Lean

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.610
principles of Womack and
Jones, which are essentially

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.000
how can we think about
improving the process in kind

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.410
of an organized way.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.320
And then we're going to
walk through a set of tools

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.290
which, over the course of
the next couple of days,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.660
we will dive deeper into.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.760
For now, with the
exception of mapping,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.960
which we're actually going
to do in some detail,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.730
we'll walk through
the tools relatively

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.820
quickly just to sort of give
you an introduction to them.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.340
Again, those will be reinforced
as the course goes on.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.970
So what do we mean by a process?

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.410
Simply put, it's an action
or a series of actions

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.750
that transforms something.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.120
We have an input, some
kind of process that

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.820
transforms it into an output.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.250
If we want to expand the
definition a little bit more,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.310
we can also think about
where the inputs come from.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.390
A manufacturing-derived
terminology is suppliers.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.980
That's actually
kind of dangerous

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.500
because in a service
thing, that may actually

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.810
be the customer
that has a request,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.160
or it may be somebody else.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.940
It may not necessarily be a
supplier in the material sense.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.940
But there is a place where
the inputs come from,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.510
a set of defined inputs, instead
of defined transformations,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.000
and the outputs
go to a customer.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.990
So let's talk about a
customer a little bit.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.240
What happens to the
outputs of a process?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.270
They go to a customer.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.240
Again, just like
supplier, the terminology,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.640
we've got to be careful
not to get too hung up on.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.900
Customer may be customer in the
sort of retail sense, somebody

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.340
who buys something.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.300
Or it may be somebody else who
gets value out of the process.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.980
So external customers are
really that retail customer.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.830
The customer is
the people who pay

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.800
for the process to take place.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.938
They may or may not
be the end user.

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:22.230
There are plenty of examples
in the aerospace business,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.450
for the engineering
side of the room,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.600
of customers, for example,
government acquisition,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.960
the people who buy things are
not the people who use them.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.390
So there's even
there a distinction

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.200
between the purchasing customer
and the end user customer.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.910
In addition, in many
complex processes,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.770
you may actually be working
for an internal customer.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.060
So a given step in a
more complicated process

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.650
may actually be
working for somebody

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.950
inside the organization.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.170
A classic case of that
in aerospace engineering

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.800
operations.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.260
Sometimes you do engineering
for outside customers.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.990
Most of the time you
do it for customers

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.190
within your organization.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.260
In the health care side,
there's an awful lot

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.990
of service provision
which are not directly

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.190
affecting the patient but
that are necessary, say,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.780
to keep the hospital going.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.250
So thinking about customers
with a little bit of nuance

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.550
is necessary.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.210
The other thing that we want
to make sure we don't get too

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.120
caught up in the
words is the fact

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.000
that our customers
also often provide some

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.950
of the inputs to our process.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.230
So actually, in a classic
retail transaction,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.800
the customer has a need, which
is an input to our process,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.830
as well as being
the ones who receive

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.290
the output of the process.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.500
So how do we
visualize a process?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.330
Very general question.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.590
A good method is
process mapping,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.110
is to try to get
our brains wrapped

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.740
around what goes on
inside our work process

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.990
through a simple map.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.130
There's a couple
of examples here.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.660
This one is close to my heart.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.180
This is an aerospace engineering
drawing release process.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.413
This is a before Lean.

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:10.080
It's actually, from
an engineering point

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.460
of view, a simple process.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.540
But when you map it out in
the sort of legacy state,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.870
it doesn't look so simple.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.600
In fact, it looks
very confusing.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.340
And this is near
and dear to my heart

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.490
because I spent 10 years
working in that box.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.240
You can't read it.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.890
That's stress analysis.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.990
And notice that's the one
that all the lines come

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.580
in and out of.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.338
So the task actually turned
out to be very simple there,

00:05:32.338 --> 00:05:34.380
but the interactions with
the rest of the process

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.780
were very confusing in
the old, pre-Lean state.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.720
Here, interestingly,
is a before picture,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.180
and Earl can probably comment
on this a little more,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.195
for heart attack treatment.

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:50.320
This one doesn't look too
bad compared to that one.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.080
It's sort of more
or less linear.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.060
There seems to be
some sort of steps,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.550
probably involving different
people working on the patient.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.310
But apparently
that was pre-Lean.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.830
So apparently that
process could be improved.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.410
AUDIENCE: Problem with that
process was it took too long.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.060
HUGH MCMANUS: OK,
too many steps.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.410
So it's organized here.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.140
We can see a pretty clear path.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.810
But lots and lots of steps.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.520
So took too long.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.770
That's easy to understand.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.780
This one, yeah, more complex set
of problems with that process.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.690
In any case, the
point here is not

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.360
to is not to go too deep on
the individual processes,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.870
but to get the point across that
in order to improve a process,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.440
you have to understand it, and
that one good way to understand

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.000
it is visually, and
maps help us with that.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.680
So here's an example.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.420
It's not even a
very good example,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.320
but it's an intuitive example.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.440
Most people would understand it.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.970
I want a hot dog.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.290
Or my kids want a hot dog.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.510
That's usually what
happens on the weekends.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.840
Dad, can we have a hot dog?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.960
So my customer, the
kids, order a hot dog.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.970
So they're providing
input to the process

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.410
as well as being
the output customer.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.260
They're kind of in a loop there.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.810
So then the question
is, do I have hot dogs?

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.333
So I go look in the pantry.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.750
Why the hot dogs
are in the pantry

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.770
I've still not figured out.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.603
They should probably
be in the refrigerator.

00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:15.760
Apparently this is not
a perfected process,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.680
but that's OK.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.570
And if there is hot dogs
in the pantry, I'm all set.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.350
If there's not, I have
to go to the store.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.290
So there's a little
bit of a decision here.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.220
Here's another supplier,
which is the store.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.490
If I have everything I
need, I cook the hot dog,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.450
I put it in the bun.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.710
I give it to the kids.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.730
We're all set.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.100
There's a little bit of an
extra sort of tail end loop

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.720
here, which is I
got to clean up.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.060
And if I'm smart about
it, I'll actually

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.560
save myself some front
end work by putting

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.350
hot dogs on the shopping
list if I used them all up.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.660
Not the greatest not
the greatest process

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.210
map, but it's one
everyone can understand.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.160
You could probably
do better, and we're

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.830
going to give you an
opportunity to do exactly that.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.650
We're going to do a little
bit more complicated process.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.340
It's not just kids
ordering from me.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.090
But it's not that
much more complicated,

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.300
and it does, in fact,
involve fixing hot dogs.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.730
In your blue folder you have
a little story about Sasha

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.970
and Andy's hot dog stand,
and the stuff in the front

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.930
give you an introduction
to Sasha and Andy,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.910
who have a hot dog stand.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.180
And they're doing fine,
but they find that they

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.350
are a little bit swamped.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.990
They have more customers
than they can deal with,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.150
and they want to
improve their process.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.429
So we're going to
help them do that.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.900
And so we're going to help them
do that with a direct exercise

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.400
here.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.570
Read the sheet here.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.520
For you, their
process is actually

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.840
already been broken down.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.900
If you were doing this with
your own process from start,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.150
you'd have to do the little
exercise of figuring out

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.340
what are the steps,
what are the inputs

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.900
and outputs to the steps.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.720
Don't even worry about the data
yet, just the first column.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.360
That's the steps that they take.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.790
That's been done for you,
and we're going to map this.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.620
So give you a second
to look at that.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.740
Think about the steps,
their inputs and outputs.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.440
And then we're going
to create a map using

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.670
the post-it notes which are out
on the table with the sharpies.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.140
For each of the process
elements, make a post-it.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.300
And this is not supposed
to be complicated.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.650
The first one is,
let's see, take order.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.240
So let's make it easy.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.545
Take order.

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:35.220
Who takes the order?

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.290
Sasha takes the order.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.910
We could add that information,
or we could use color.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.973
Perhaps this color
implies Sasha.

00:09:44.973 --> 00:09:47.390
And we'll put that on our
thing, and we're using a sticky.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:47.890
Why?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.240
We can move it around
because a priori,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.760
we're not really sure how
these things should be arranged

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.230
to make the most sense.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.770
Let's think about inputs and
outputs who gives the input?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.670
Customer, OK.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.858
So there's another one.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.650
So we might want to do
something like that.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.823
And you get the picture.

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.740
We're not going to do
the whole thing for you.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.060
You're going to do it.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.930
Get the stickies.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.520
Arrange them on the board.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.980
Don't start drawing
lines yet because that

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.940
would kind of ruin the point
of having the stickies there.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.360
When you think you have
everything puzzled out,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.970
there might be some other
details that are necessary.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.040
One of them is that there
might be waiting or inventory.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.640
There may be places
where the process waits.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.010
And the traditional symbol
for that is a triangle.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.500
We don't have any
triangle-shaped stickies,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.960
so we are going to use
something like this.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.700
Perhaps there is a
line of customers.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.048
So there's kind of an inventory
waiting box in front of them.

00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:52.590
I don't know.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.210
I'm making this
up as I go along.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.970
And perhaps a decision has
to be made at that point.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.370
Do we take the order or
tell them no, I'm sorry,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.320
we don't sell that?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.490
Decisions are diamonds.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.270
You can do a diamond by just
putting a square sideways.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.800
When all that is done, then
it's time to draw the lines.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.170
You can actually even
make that temporary

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.230
and use stickies with arrows
on them, or use string.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.115
I've participated in
exercises where you do that.

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:21.740
That's getting a
little bit too clever.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.780
It gets a bit messy.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.638
Best thing to do is
arrange everything

00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:25.930
on the board with the stickies.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.100
When you think you got
everything lined up,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.780
then draw lines to show
how the process is flowing.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.030
This is a speed exercise.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.160
You only have 10 minutes,
so get with your groups.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.980
Here are the basic mapping
symbols, triangle, rectangle,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.060
diamond.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.290
Don't worry about issues yet.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.490
We're going to get to that.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.150
Map out this process.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:12:09.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.120
HUGH MCMANUS: So time's up.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.640
I think everybody's
got something

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.620
that approximates a map here.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.450
And don't worry,
you'll get that chance

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.420
to play with it more
in the near future.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.820
So let's see what we have.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.860
Let's have the
folks in the back,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.970
who have a map that
looks kind of different,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.490
let us know what they have.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.810
AUDIENCE: So we had the
[INAUDIBLE] colors as well,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.830
and it starts at the upper
left and goes down here.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.590
We don't actually
have the process line,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:45.250
but essentially the time
next to each post-it

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.210
referred to how long that
is suggested to take.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.620
And then we have this
loop-interlook process here

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.280
where Andy will need to prepare
the hot dog, and potentially

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.630
multiple hot dogs.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.810
And coming up here,
Sasha checking the order

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.615
and completing that process,
as well as ending with

00:13:07.615 --> 00:13:11.905
a 10-minute-per-hour
makes sense.

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:13.280
HUGH MCMANUS: And
you've got sort

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.540
of a different
physical arrangement.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.340
Comes down and
then back up again,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.060
which is sort of enforced by
the geometry of that board.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.420
So that's fine.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.732
And I guess because maybe
you didn't have time

00:13:25.732 --> 00:13:28.190
to finish with the lines, it's
a little bit less clear kind

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.480
of what the rework is.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.240
It looks a little more linear.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.047
That's fine.

00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:34.880
And I don't think we're
going to go through.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.880
It looks like everybody
else also did a nice job.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.490
The point, though, is not to
go through each individual one

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.800
and give you a grade.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.290
The point actually is that
I think all of these maps

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.450
are successful in
visually representing

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.780
the process and some of
its difficulties, the fact

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.530
that it is fairly long, that
it has reworks and decisions,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.200
that it has weights and times.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.220
Those are all captured.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.420
And there's no real right
answer because that's

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.480
the point of our next slide.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.580
It's a 2D visualization.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.450
It's something that's actually
taking place in 3D space.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.610
Plus there's time issues.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.820
There's issues of
these processes

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.290
that are not on the main loop.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.210
You can't basically
get everything

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.620
into a two-dimensional map.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.880
You do the best you can.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.490
You use it as a way of
communicating the process.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.680
So capturing and communicating
the key features of the process

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.540
is what you want to do.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.400
One thing that you do
have to be careful of,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.580
and this exercise is actually
fairly carefully designed

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.470
this way, you have to capture--

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.840
I actually shouldn't say
avoid unneeded details.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.240
You have to capture the
right level of detail.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.940
If we just said,
make the hot dog,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.670
we'd miss all of this
interesting stuff.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.768
On the other hand, if we went
through--and some people did,

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:55.310
and that's OK because I didn't
tell you not to-- went through

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.280
the individual, OK, take the
order, chat with the customer,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.930
take the money.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:05.135
At some level of detail we
might actually want to do that.

00:15:05.135 --> 00:15:07.010
At the level of detail
of this whole process,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.200
if we get into those
individual things,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.910
it gets too complicated.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:16.190
so most folks did capture that
level of detail about right.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.930
So I think we've all
succeeded in doing

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.460
the key thing,
which is capturing

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.615
the features of the process.

00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:29.240
We're going to come
back to these maps.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.900
But for now, that's
it for processes.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.420
Like I said, if there's one
thing you take away from here,

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.880
it's thinking about
work as processes

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.150
because once you think of
something as a process,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.990
you can understand and improve
it, often fairly intuitively.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.970
Often it really is application
of common sense to the process

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.890
to make it better.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.870
So a little bit of
a transition now.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:00.190
We're going to get into the
five Lean thinking fundamentals.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.240
Earl introduced you a little
earlier to the origins of Lean,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.100
how it came out of a study
of Japanese practices

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.020
by Jim Womack and his team.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.930
And Womack and Jones
wrote a book in 1995,

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.140
where they basically
took the base, the ideas,

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.430
the concepts of
the Japanese system

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.970
and captured them not
so much as a system,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:31.530
but as a way of transforming
existing processes into better

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.030
ones.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.680
They said, let's
take these principles

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.690
and figure out how
they can be used

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.840
to take existing processes,
which are maybe not so great,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.970
and transform them
into better ones.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.340
And that's kind of
the essence of Lean

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.940
as practiced in North
America and Europe, at least.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.690
And here they are.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.110
Here are the
fundamental principles.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.850
First of all, specify value.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.960
Understand what we want to
accomplish because if we don't

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.830
do that, we can't
really think clearly

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.640
about any of the other steps.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.930
So what is the value
of our hot dog stand?

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.150
What is the value
of a hot dog stand?

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.230
Hot dogs, right?

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:14.480
Hot dogs for customers, warm,
safe, no diseases or bugs.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.750
You can think of a couple
of the quality issues.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.530
You can think of
some nuance to it.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.619
But basically, we
want to make hot dogs.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.660
Identify the value stream.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.310
We've sort of done that.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:31.630
If we think about the process
and take a process map,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.370
but a rather specific
kind of process map, which

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.820
is a process map that
follows the value

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.400
added product
through the process,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.050
and then think about how
value is added to that product

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.260
as it moves through the process,
that's a value stream map.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.550
We're pretty close on this.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.380
We figured out the
value is the hot dog,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.240
and we're following the
hot dog pretty much.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.820
We're following a hot
dog order through there.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.200
So all of ours are
approaching value stream.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.730
Not all process maps are.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.130
We could have followed
Sasha around, right?

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.000
What does that person do?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.670
That's not a value stream map.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.690
It's a process map.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.820
It's following that
person's work process.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.850
But value stream map
follows the product,

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.290
the value added product.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.790
Make value flow.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.200
Saw a couple of maps earlier.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.000
There was that engineering map.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.010
Didn't look like a lot
of flow in that map.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.870
The lines are all
over the place.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.420
The heart attack map was better.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.660
At least there was
some coherent patient

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.700
comes in to patient is
resolved, in some way.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.300
So there was a potential
there for flow, at least.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.205
But Earl was saying
that in the old state,

00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:39.080
it wasn't really being
achieved because there

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.520
was too many steps.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.030
It was too slow.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.990
So what we would like
to do is have value flow

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.930
through the value stream
as continuously as

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.960
possible, not necessarily as
fast as possible, a low speed.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.840
Usually processes
are too slow, so it's

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.570
reasonable to say we would
like it to flow quickly

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.130
through the process.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.093
Then we get a little
bit more sophisticated,

00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:02.510
and by the end of
the class, we'll

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.850
get to what this concept means.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.160
It may not be
intuitive right away.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.950
If we have a system
that flows and creates

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.590
value for the customer,
there's the potential

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.820
that we can allow the customers
to pull value from that system.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.340
Like Lean, that's a
slightly fraught word.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.990
What does that mean,
especially when

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.450
we're pulling on something
that flows or pulling on water?

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.742
I don't know, the metaphor's
getting kind of messed up.

00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:30.890
But the idea here is that
essentially if the system flows

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.380
continuously and creates
value, from the customer's

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.170
point of view, when they
want something, they get it.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.900
They can come up to the hot dog
stand, say, I want a hot dog.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.980
The hot dog comes.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.140
They're happy.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.810
And this act of satisfying
the customer actually

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.100
controls the process all the
way back to the lowest levels.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.110
The customer gets their hot dog.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.123
We essentially
have a process that

00:19:56.123 --> 00:19:58.040
doesn't require a whole
lot of decision making

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.460
that isn't complicated,
that flows, that creates

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.000
the hot dogs, that orders the
buns, that cleans up the grill,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.810
whatever.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.190
The whole system is set up
so that the customer desire

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.600
activates the system to satisfy
that desire in a way that's

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.510
continuous and easy
and creates value

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.610
with the minimum of waste.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.260
And finally,
pursuing perfection.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.150
If we can do all
of this, we're not

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.730
done because we can
always do better.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.660
Earl mentioned the F18,
how they identified them

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.747
as a Lean enterprise.

00:20:31.747 --> 00:20:33.830
And the first thing they
said is, that's not true.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.570
We have so much more to do.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.130
Right attitude.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.500
They knew that they
weren't perfect.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.660
An external observer
said you're pretty good.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.400
But they knew that
they weren't perfect.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.580
They were, in fact,
pursuing perfection.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.900
So this is a continuous process.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.400
All right.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.220
So we're going to spend
the rest of both this unit,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.530
and then after lunch, the
second unit, essentially

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.530
walking through these
concepts, going a little deeper

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.830
and also giving you some tools
on each one of these levels.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.750
First thing we're going
to talk about is value.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.560
This one is fraught.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.510
It's fairly easy
to define value--

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.112
not always.

00:21:11.112 --> 00:21:12.820
You have to be a little
bit careful- But?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.320
It's fairly easy
to define the value

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.880
of the output of a process.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.850
We want hot dogs.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.220
That's our value.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.350
When we start looking
in more detail,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.410
what's the value of the
individual process steps?

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.100
Is cooking the hot dog valuable?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.270
I hope so, assuming
you want it cooked.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:37.730
But is cleaning
the grill valuable?

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.927
Maybe.

00:21:38.927 --> 00:21:40.760
We have to think about
that a little harder.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.210
And in a real workplace,
this can get very difficult,

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.740
especially if you
start attaching

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.170
personal self-worth issues.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.455
If you're told you
are non-value added,

00:21:55.455 --> 00:21:56.830
what does that do
to your morale?

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.050
And it's not just
a morale issue.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.330
It's also a motivation issue.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:10.030
When we first started applying
Lean to product development

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.800
activities, we got things
completely up and down

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.440
the scale from people arguing
that their work was valuable

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.800
because they knew it was without
really any context to what it

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.080
did for the customer, all
the way to the other side,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.730
where we had some
Lean experts come in

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.930
and say, well, analysis isn't
valuable because it doesn't add

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.350
anything directly to the
customer, which, as an analyst,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.120
I sort of had problems with.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.090
It took me a while to figure
out exactly what the problem was

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:40.930
with that.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.840
But people that were too
eager to essentially say

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.870
that activities, and
by implication, people

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.950
were non-value added.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.310
The point is that you
have to think about it.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.600
So there's some guides on here.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.020
We can think about value as
like cooking the hot dog, things

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.480
that directly transform material
or information in the direction

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.220
of the customer's desire and
done correctly, no mistakes.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.690
That's unambiguously valuable.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.310
The other end's kind of easy to
think about, too, pure waste.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.660
Consumes resources
but creates no value.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.180
So waiting.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.520
Inventory, stuff that's
just sitting around.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.770
Mistakes.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.150
Reworking things in a
creative sense can be good.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.300
But if it's because you're
fixing a mistake, no value

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.560
there.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.888
Things like that.

00:23:36.888 --> 00:23:38.680
And then in the middle,
there may be things

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.950
that we know don't really add
value but we simply have to do.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.860
There may be setup
and tear down issues

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.510
with our current technologies.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.930
There may be the necessity
to do project coordination.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.720
We may have to satisfy
regulations or laws.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.780
So there may be things
that we got to do.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.508
Like I said, t the
individual task level,

00:23:59.508 --> 00:24:01.050
that's not necessarily
an easy thing,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.250
and here's a great example.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.780
Does inspection add value?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.200
A couple of little
brainteasers here.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.490
Inspect those.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.230
Everybody got them, maybe?

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.520
Yeah.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.570
This one's funny.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.590
One of my colleagues
in the back,

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.440
we have a mark-up
copy of our slides

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.320
because we are always doing
continuous improvement.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.480
She found one of these
double word things.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.120
See the two V's?

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.522
She found a double word error.

00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:29.730
It wasn't even a line jumper.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.920
They were right next to
each other on a slide we've

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.980
been using for five years.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.330
So people are not
very good at this.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:43.750
People are not very good
at inspecting in quality.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.280
So is it value added or not?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.410
And you could have a
lively argument about.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.190
We're not now.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.022
Actually, anybody
have any ideas?

00:24:52.022 --> 00:24:53.730
What's your gut feeling
about inspection?

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.875
Value added or not?

00:24:56.875 --> 00:24:59.000
AUDIENCE: It depends on
where it is in the process.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.710
HUGH MCMANUS: Depends on
where it is in the process.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.640
Very good.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.980
Very good answer, actually,
nice general answer.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.530
But a very good answer.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.300
Yeah. aren't are very
good at inspecting.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.735
And inspecting in quality is
actually known not to work.

00:25:12.735 --> 00:25:14.610
On the other hand, you
might have to do that.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.242
If something is
super safety critical

00:25:16.242 --> 00:25:18.450
and it's just really hard
to do right the first time,

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.950
you might have to inspect it.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.580
Also, continuous inspection
of the work process

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.860
is known to be quite valuable.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.050
Inspecting in quality
at the end of something

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.080
that should go right the
first time, probably not.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.600
And unfortunately a lot
of traditional, especially

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.180
manufacturing-type processes
lean on that a little too

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.020
heavily.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.700
So context dependent,
an interesting case

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.100
where you have to be
careful that you don't

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.810
assume something either way.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.060
Inspection is non-value added.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.380
No, no, no, it's
super safety critical.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.920
We got to do it.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.545
I don't want to fly
in an airplane that

00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:53.490
hasn't been inspected.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.100
But inspecting something that's
coming off a line that you're

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.190
making a million of, given
that you know inspection

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.880
doesn't work very well as a
quality method, not so good.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.478
So that's value.

00:26:04.478 --> 00:26:06.270
We're going to do a
little exercise in that

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.450
before the day is over,
before this class is over.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.030
Identifying value stream.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.470
What is the value stream?

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.580
It's the end- to-end
activities that

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.020
take place to deliver value.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.230
Said this already against
that first slide, starting

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.730
with the raw material or
the initial information,

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.700
ending with the
customer, or user.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.890
From the beginning to
the end, the material,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:33.960
the product flows is often a
backwards flow of information.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.410
Customer needs, schedules,
inventory information,

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.280
et cetera.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.610
So is the main flow of the
value from raw material

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.630
or raw information to something
the customer wants, often

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.820
a backwards flow of information.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.100
What moves in a value stream?

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.390
Manufacturing, it's easy.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.160
Stuff.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.420
In design and
services, less easy.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.410
Some kind of information flows.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.410
I call it the help line.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:03.730
I have a question.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.960
I want an answer.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.970
It's all information.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.758
It's not physical.

00:27:07.758 --> 00:27:10.300
It makes it a little bit harder
to track, a little bit harder

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.320
to think about.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.210
But there is a
flow of information

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.220
that is satisfying the customer.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.670
In human services, medical,
for example, it may be people.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.730
It may be the actual customer
flowing through the system.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.220
And that could be in medicine.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.330
It could also be great
Lean company, Disneyland.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.450
They process people
and make them happy.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.780
But they think of it
very much as a process.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.690
So there's a flow of people
coming in sad and grumpy

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:44.080
and going out sad, grumpy, and
hot and poor, at least in my--

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.023
no, I joke.

00:27:45.023 --> 00:27:45.940
They have a good time.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.880
And the process is
set up so they do.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.150
So thinking about value streams
the definition of the value

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.640
stream is the set
of activities that

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.820
adds value to the work product
to satisfy the customer.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.960
So the first order analysis
of the value stream

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.740
is to look for things that
don't do that, look for waste.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.290
This is called waste hunting,
and it's actually a lot of fun

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.820
because it's easy.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.160
Most processes, once
you've defined them,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.910
it's very easy to
find wasteful steps.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.660
May be a little harder
to get rid of them,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.960
but it's really
easy to find them.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.280
And waste comes in a couple
of different flavors.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.340
We're actually going
to be talking mostly

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.010
about muda, about
just looking at stuff

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.160
that doesn't add value.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.200
So cleaning the grill or
waiting or throwing away

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.560
the unused hot dogs at the
end of the day, or stuff that

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.603
just is clearly not valuable.

00:28:41.603 --> 00:28:43.770
Something to keep in the
back of your mind, though--

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.370
and we'll come
back to this later,

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.710
especially the
health care folks,

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.810
you're going to get a good
dose of this tomorrow--

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.500
are issues that can cause muda.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.470
And there's some Japanese
words associated with this that

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.490
don't have good translations.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.500
So we like to use the
Japanese muri, overburden

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.350
or unreasonableness.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.950
Essentially, there's
somebody in the process that

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.700
too much is being asked of.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.108
Telling them to work harder
doesn't do very much good.

00:29:18.108 --> 00:29:18.900
This can be people.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.550
It can be machines.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.410
We've got to run
this machine 24/7.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.090
How good is that process?

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.347
How long is it going to work?

00:29:27.347 --> 00:29:29.180
It's going to work until
the machine breaks,

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.170
and then it's not going
to work at all anymore.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.420
So being unreasonable,
overburdening things

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.260
tends to spawn muda waste.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.930
Even more dynamic as is mura,
unevenness, instability.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:49.310
Again, there aren't
particularly good translations.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.610
But the idea here is that
if the process is uneven,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.480
if it's irregular or
fluctuating, it can't flow.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.320
Again, our metaphor there, our
sort of fluid flow metaphor,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.040
if the stream is turbulent,
if it has back flows, if it

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.050
has backwaters where
it's not flowing,

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.550
it has fast parts where it
is flowing, if it's uneven,

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.400
it's not going to be
an efficient process.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.970
And so these are
also kinds of wastes

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.510
that one should look for.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.560
And often, these are the
root causes of the musa,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.030
of the obvious waste.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.660
Here are seven or eight mudas.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.500
These are sort of classic,
right out of Toyota and Womack.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.250
There are lots of
lists like this.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.830
In fact, most fields-- if you're
in health care, engineering,

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.230
whatever, you look
up the latest book,

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.480
they'll have a list like this.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.790
It won't be the same because
everybody likes to make up

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.170
lists for their own field.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.930
That's fine, actually.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.790
These actually are
kind of fundamental.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.370
You can translate these
into almost any field.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.160
But if you want to make up
your own, that's good, too.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.410
The whole point
is to categorize.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.750
Categorizing waste
makes it easier to spot.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.677
So things like waiting.

00:31:02.677 --> 00:31:03.760
That's pretty fundamental.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.340
Stuff that's not moving,
people that aren't working,

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.290
it's a waste.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.000
Moving stuff around.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.870
Moving employees or moving
the material or information.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.900
This is essentially movement
of the value added stuff.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.970
This is movement
of the resources,

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.220
the employees, and the stuff
necessary to do the work.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.210
Either of those is a waste.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.400
If your stuff is moving around,
it's not being worked on,

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.260
and that costs
money or something.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.220
It costs people's time.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.210
It costs money to
move around inventory.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.188
Stuff that's sitting.

00:31:34.188 --> 00:31:35.730
It's kind of the
converse of waiting.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.050
People are waiting,
stuff is waiting.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.640
Producing too much.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.100
It's efficient to produce
large batches of things.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.750
That's still true even
in our Lean world.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.070
However, if you don't
need them, it's a waste.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.520
It's tempting, in Earl's
analogy, to buy what's on sale,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.030
but if it goes bad, that's
a waste, having too much.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.220
Defects, always bad.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.910
Doing more work than you need
to affect the transformation.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.200
Engineers are great at that.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.710
There's some question about
whether our health care system

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.900
over processes these things.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.740
That's a controversy, but all
of these things don't add value.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.860
And they're fairly easy to spot.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.590
Unused employee
creativity is often

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.810
added as the eighth waste.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.620
Essentially, it's
missed opportunities.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.290
It may be just missed work.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.960
But if they're just not
working, that's waiting.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.400
But if they're working
at a sort of mental level

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.940
that's beneath them, if
you're losing opportunities

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.520
to take advantage of the
employee's creativity

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.700
and capability, that,
too, is a waste.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.880
Here's a really simple example
of unnecessary movement

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.770
from the health care world.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.470
This is called a
spaghetti chart.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.118
It's actually a kind
of process chart.

00:32:52.118 --> 00:32:53.285
It's not a value stream map.

00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:55.240
It's completely different.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.200
You have a physical layout
that's a hospital floor.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.820
And you trace something.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.180
It could be the patient.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.100
It could be the nurse.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.830
In this case it's the
nurse doing their work.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:10.980
And this nurse is
all over the place

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.730
just because things
are badly arranged.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.280
To get the work
done, she actually

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.098
ends up walking 1250 feet
to do something trivial.

00:33:21.098 --> 00:33:23.640
Hopefully the patient is going
from the elevator to the room,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.890
but the nurse, to get
the patient checked in,

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.270
has to run all over the
place to do their job.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:34.430
So it's a great visual way
of finding waste of movement.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.480
And here's some tools at this
value stream level to help.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.950
One of them is called kitting.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.790
This is kind of the
active version of 5S.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.310
If we need to move materials
to the place of work,

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.190
why don't we move
them laid out the way

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.150
they're going to be used?

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.348
So here's a aerospace example.

00:33:54.348 --> 00:33:56.890
We had a beautiful picture that
we didn't have copyright for,

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.730
so now we have a bad diagram.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.740
But if you have a complicated
mechanical assembly that

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.790
uses lots of tubes
and wires, why not

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.423
just deliver all the tubes
and wires you need in a box

00:34:06.423 --> 00:34:08.590
where they're laid out nice
and easy for the workers

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.420
to get them?

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.929
Likewise for a
medical procedure,

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:17.139
having everything laid out nice
and neat is a good practice.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.010
Not new, right?

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.800
I mean, a good OR
doctor is going

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.989
to have a tray that
looks like that.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.699
But why isn't that
standard practice?

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.250
Why isn't that just
done everywhere?

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.510
Mistake proofing.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.780
Mistakes in a process are waste.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.610
And relying on people to
fix mistakes is dicey.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.221
People are good at some things,
but not so good at others.

00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:40.929
And one of the things
they're not so good

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:45.790
is getting things right on
a really consistent basis

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.380
over many, many repeats.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.790
So why not make the process
itself mistake-proof?

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.989
This is a great example.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.989
It makes me feel much better
about being in a hospital.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:01.570
This is vacuum, and
this is oxygen. Now

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:04.270
some things you want to hook up
to vacuum, and some things you

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.260
want to hook up to oxygen.
And those look the same.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.390
And in fact, the
business end is the same.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.850
The coupler is the same.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.320
Obviously, hooking
the breather up

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.920
to vacuum or the sort of
waste disposal thing up

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.280
to pure oxygen that will light
it on fire, not a good idea.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.160
So there's a little stud so
that when you hook the thing up,

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.620
it won't go into the wrong one.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.600
Very simple, very effective.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.640
That basic idea applies across
an amazing number of fields.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.310
Make it so you can't
hook it up wrong.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:44.690
There's a possibly apocryphal
story about airplanes.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.940
A lot of airplanes
these days fly by wire.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.850
Most of the controls go
through electronic components.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:53.840
They use the same couplers
because it's cheaper that way,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.370
so it's perfectly
possible to hook

00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:01.080
up the right-hand controls to
the left wing and vice versa.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.920
That's news, right?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.450
No, it's not possible anymore.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.570
That is something that has been
mistake-proofed, fortunately,

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.220
long ago.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.700
Mistake-proofing the process.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.330
Checklist.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.950
This is a no brainer.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.790
But there's a great book
out in the medical field

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.430
called Checklist
Revolution because it's

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.680
revolutionary to use checklists.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.600
This, as a patient,
scares the heck out of me

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.440
because in the aerospace
field, commercial airliners

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.840
are astonishingly safe.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.270
They're probably the
safest complicated thing

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.630
any civilization has
ever come up with.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.640
I'm sure they are, in fact.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.490
And one of the
reasons is that they

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.980
are completely anal
retentive about checklists.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.060
Maintenance people do it.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.110
The pilots do it.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.760
Everybody operates off of lists.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.140
So you're not relying
on fallible human memory

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.273
to make sure that the flaps
work before you take off.

00:36:56.273 --> 00:36:57.690
There's actually
a famous accident

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.810
where they didn't bother
to do the checklist.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.660
And the flaps were not
working, and they took off,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.110
and it didn't work out so well.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.540
So very simple way of making
sure that complex processes

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.490
are actually executed
correctly by fallible people.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.040
OK.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.040
We're going to do a quick
exercise in waste walking.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.800
I have handed out some dots.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.410
And we're going
to look at our map

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.138
and decide if each one of
the steps and decisions--

00:37:26.138 --> 00:37:27.930
don't bother with the
weights because we're

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.138
pretty sure those are
non-value added-- but the steps

00:37:30.138 --> 00:37:31.380
and decisions, for sure.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.360
Are they value added, green?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.950
Do something for the customer.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.450
Are they necessary waste?

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.190
We got to do them,
but they don't really

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.550
help the customer, but
maybe the health board

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.950
or whatever would be unhappy
if we didn't do them.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:44.920
Or are they pure waste?

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.050
Are they something we
should try to get rid of?

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:47.550
And

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.425
There's no right answer,
and we're only going

00:37:49.425 --> 00:37:52.660
to take about five minutes.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.290
But we want you to, as a
group, think about these

00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.510
issues against the process map
that you've already done there.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.720
Here is your guide
of wastes, if that's

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.970
helpful to your discussion.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.700
Take about five minutes,
and that will actually

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.410
conclude our exercise.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.160
But don't go away.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.493
We'll have a couple words
before we let you go to lunch.

00:38:13.493 --> 00:38:15.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:27.877 --> 00:38:29.460
HUGH MCMANUS:
Everybody's had a chance

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.080
to at least argue about this.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.170
A lot of times the value
isn't so much in the answer.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.450
It's in the debating.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.720
Trying to find out,
maybe you never

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.880
do decide whether
it's valuable or not,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.130
but you do understand
the issues.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.390
So let's have one
group that hadn't done

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.370
it before, maybe you folks.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:57.150
Tell us your conclusions
against your map there.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.950
So you're on camera.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.310
Do a good job here
of explaining to us

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.530
the value and non-value
added that you guys

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.560
found for the processes.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.115
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
customer, we

00:39:09.115 --> 00:39:10.740
figured that, well,
it's not essential.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.810
People expect it to happen.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.300
[INAUDIBLE] people get happy.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.538
Packing order on the board
and getting the order we

00:39:17.538 --> 00:39:18.330
[INAUDIBLE] yellow.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.090
We think obviously
was not value added.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.118
Then decision, when
you add dots, again,

00:39:23.118 --> 00:39:24.660
it doesn't add value
to the customer,

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.510
but it needs to be done.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.960
[INAUDIBLE] the
order all the way

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.070
was is quite straightforward
that adds value.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.120
And then after that, checking
the order is one of those--

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.453
I guess it doesn't add
value to me as a customer.

00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:39.870
But if it's not
done [INAUDIBLE],,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.520
I'll be very happy.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.960
Adding beverage adds value.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.377
[INAUDIBLE] customer
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:44.377 --> 00:39:46.900
Ideally customer would
have just been [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.020
waste time [INAUDIBLE] come up.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.510
And delivering order
obviously adds value.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:54.180
The rest of the general things
like setting up the work area,

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.890
cleaning, service,
stuff like that,

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.970
is all regulatory requirements
and necessary evils.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:00.930
HUGH MCMANUS: OK.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.472
See if we get any compare and
contrast with, say, this group.

00:40:04.472 --> 00:40:06.180
You guys didn't read
the report, did you?

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.550
What do you guys have here?

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:16.080
AUDIENCE: So we have taking
the order, collecting money,

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.700
it's all very important.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.050
Tracking order is something that
doesn't really add value to it,

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.060
or putting it on the board.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.582
Then of course,
getting the order,

00:40:25.582 --> 00:40:29.400
making it, cooking the hot
dogs, that's all important.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.020
Checking if the
order is complete

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.100
doesn't really add value.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.820
But we need to do that
so that you know what

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.030
you're giving to the customer.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:43.230
Of course you have to give them
their beverage and [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.300
their order.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.420
And then setting up and cleaning
the back area where you're

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.480
working, that's not really
value added to the customer

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.034
because they're not
interacting with that space.

00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:54.951
But the place where they
put on the condiments

00:40:54.951 --> 00:41:00.340
is important because it's
part of their simple process.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.930
HUGH MCMANUS: OK,
so that's good.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.800
So we see some of the
possibilities here.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.000
The thing that I
noticed that actually

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.305
is often one of the
more controversial ones

00:41:10.305 --> 00:41:11.350
that you had different.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.220
You guys called it customer
relations and gave it a green.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:21.280
And those folks chat with
customer and gave it a yellow.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.112
And some people give it a red.

00:41:23.112 --> 00:41:24.320
Now there's a red over there.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.620
There's a yellow
to red over there.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.970
Right.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:32.240
So there's some
judgment calls in there.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.920
And if this was a real
exercise, what would

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.570
we need to make that call before
we told Sasha, no, sit down.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:42.920
Stop talking to the customers.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.300
No talking.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.320
Before we made that
call, what would we need?

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.852
AUDIENCE: They ask the
customer what they value.

00:41:50.852 --> 00:41:51.560
HUGH MCMANUS: OK.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.457
Ask the customer.

00:41:52.457 --> 00:41:55.040
AUDIENCE: I was going to say you
could kind of do the analysis

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.873
and see your profit over
time versus chattering.

00:41:57.873 --> 00:41:59.290
HUGH MCMANUS: See
the chat versus,

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.760
OK, we can get some data.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.517
AUDIENCE: Decide what our
mission is as a company.

00:42:04.517 --> 00:42:05.600
HUGH MCMANUS: There we go.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.840
Yeah.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.390
Are we all about
customer service,

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.610
or are we just about hot
dogs and nothing else?

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.410
Are we the hot dog Nazis?

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.620
We're just not nice to people
but have great hot dogs.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.890
Yeah, there's a bunch of there's
a bunch of different factors

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.120
that aren't on this
piece of paper.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.690
That's the key thing.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.970
If we're sitting in
our classroom here,

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:29.340
we can't know these things.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.620
Here's another Japanese word.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.220
We have to go to the gemba,
which is the actual place.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.880
That's the literal translation
of gemba, the actual place

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.200
where the work happens.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:45.260
And this is another
basic idea in Lean.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.350
We have to go to the place
where the work happens.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.240
Sadly, we can't go
visit Sasha and Andy

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.040
because they're imaginary.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.330
Unfortunately, we also
can't visit our shoe factory

00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.290
because of schedule and
budget constraints this year.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.510
But after we come
back from lunch,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.870
Earl will be taking us
through a video factory tour

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.520
so we can see real
work in action.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, let's start with where we were.
We were talking about exponential

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
growth in populations.
And, we said we could describe this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
as one over the dN/dt equals some
growth rate, r.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And, in this case,
we're talking about,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
let me ask that is a question.
As a model for population growth,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
what's wrong with this?  What does
this project?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is N.  This is time.
There's no stopping it.  I mean,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we'd be knee deep in everything if
populations grew according to this

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
model, OK, because it just goes off
into infinity in terms of density.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, we know that this is inadequate.
In fact, some people describe the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
entire field of population ecology
as a field that tries to determine

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
why real populations can't grow
according to this model.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In other words,
the whole field is trying to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
understand what the mechanisms are
in populations that limit their

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
growth.  So, they don't grow
exponentially forever.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, in this case, this is really a
maximum growth rate.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We can call that r Max.
And in this case, it's a constant.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, when we're talking about
exponential growth,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the growth rate per unit time is the
maximum growth rate that that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
population is capable of under those
conditions and it's a constant.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So, if we want to plot it this way,
one over N, dN/dt, as a function of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
N, is constant.
It doesn't change as density changes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So, now we're going to take a
historical look at this.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Back in the 1920s, two fellows
named Pearl and Reed wanted to model

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
human population growth.
And they looked at this exponential

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
growth equation,
and they said there's got to be

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
something wrong with that.
We can't just apply that to humans,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
although if they plotted as a
function of time,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and this is humans in the US from
1800 to 1900, and this is the human

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
population size,
if they plotted this on this curve,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
they got something that looked like
this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, it kind of looked like
exponential growth.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But, when they went in it actually
looked at one over ND,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
dN/dt, which would be the slope
along here, they found that it looks

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
something like this.
In other words,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the actual growth rate of the
population was decreasing as the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
number of humans increased.
And this is called a density

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:28.000
dependent response.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
OK, so if we look at this,
remember from last time that r is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
equal to the birth rate minus the
death rate, right?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, we can look at,
this is just a simple cartoon

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
drawing of what's going on here.
Density dependent factors regulate

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
population size.
So, if we plot one over ND,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
dN/dt as either a birth rate or a
death rate, as a function of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
population density,
when you have density,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
really the one that's the most
important here is looking at this

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
one, that death rate increases as
population increases,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and birth rate decreases.
And you have an intersection here

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
where birth rate and death rate are
equal, and your population's going

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to stabilize there where there will
be no change in population growth.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And these density dependent birth
rates and death rates introduce a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
stabilizing factor.
As N increases, r decreases in the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
population.  And that's what brings
population back into some sort of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
equilibrium.  OK, so all
right, forget that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, let's go back over to Pearl and
Reed.  We're going to stay on the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
board for awhile.
So the question is,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
how do we modify that equation,
our simple exponential growth

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
equation, so that it more
realistically describes real

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
populations that can't grow totally
unconstrained?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So what Pearl and Reed did,
how do we modify the exponential

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:59.000
growth?  So, here's what we want the
characteristics to be of this

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:14.000
equation.  We want one over N,
dN/dt, to go to zero as N gets large.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And we want it to go to our max,
the maximum growth rate, when N

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
approaches zero.
In other words, at really,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
really low population density is,
you can effectively have exponential

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
growth because nothing's
limiting you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
When the density gets very,
very large, you want this growth

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
rate to go to zero.
So, they came up, so let's plot

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000
this N.  This is T,
and here's our exponential growth

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000
equation.
And they came up with a function

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that looks like this.
So, this would be one over N,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and to describe this, we have this
equation.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And this is called the logistic
equation for reasons that are

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
historically obscure.
This is a French term that has

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
something to do with,
anybody know, who speaks French?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It has to do with something
military.  Anyway,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I've never been able to figure out
why they call this the

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000
logistic equation.
But it doesn't matter what it's

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000
called, this is what it is.
And K here is the carrying capacity

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:26.000
of the environment.
It's the maximum number of

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
organisms were the population
levels off, OK?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
All right, so let's look at this.
Let's replot this, because it's

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:52.000
easier to analyze the features.
We're going to plot one over N,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
dN/dt as a function of N.  If we
want to rewrite the equation,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
one over N, dN/dt equals our max.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:20.000
We're just rearranging that equation
to make it easier to visualize.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:32.000
OK?  So that we have a line that we
can put that on,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:45.000
such that K is the X intercept,
and what's this?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Our max, exactly.
So, you can see these features over

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000
here at this plot, right?
So, as this goes to zero,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
or as N is very large, one over N,
dN/dt goes to zero.  And, when N is

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
very small, one over N,
dN/dt is near our max.  You're

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
basically growing.
You're over here where the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
exponential growth curve and the
logistical curve are essentially the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
same thing.  Yeah?  Do I
have something wrong?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Oh, very good,
very good, very good.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Thank you.  Absolutely right.
OK, so the slope here is going to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:09.000
be minus r max over K.  .
OK, so here we have a nice density

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:23.000
dependent response.
OK, let's analyze some more

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:35.000
features of this.
Just looking at the exponential and

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the logistic, just to summarize,
one over N, dN/dt as a function of N,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and if we just look at the dN/dt as
a function of N,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.000
for exponential we already said that
this is a flat line, right?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It's a constant,
but the actual change in numbers as

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
a function of time is a straight
line, whereas for the logistic,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000
one over N, dN/dt as a function of N,
what does this look like?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
We just did it,
so we are summarizing here.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But here's one that I want you to
think about.  What does the dN/dt

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
look like as a function of N if
something's growing according to the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
logistic equation?
Like this?  Yes, there you go,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
like that.  Right.
Because there is an inflection point

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000
here, right?  So,
this is what's sometimes called the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
optimum yield,
and believe it or not,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
this model is actually used in
fisheries conservation for years.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Now we know that it's so much more
complicated than that that you can't

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
just set the model is.
But one could argue that if you are

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
managing a population that you want
to harvest, that you try to keep

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
them at the density at which the
dN/dt, the production of organisms,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
is maximal.  So, you try to maintain
a population there at that point.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:22.000
One of the features of the logistic
equation is that it assumes

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:40.000
instantaneous feedback of the
density on growth rate.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
In other words,
it says in a population of a certain

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
density, the results in terms of
offspring will be instantaneous.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And we know that's not true.  So,
this is an oversimplification.  Even

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
in the simplest organisms,
even microbes in a culture,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
say you suddenly starve them up some
substrate that they're using.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It takes a while for their
biochemistry to readjust before that.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
They might have one generation
that's still at the same growth rate

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
as it was before,
before the biochemistry readjusts

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and says, whoa,
we can't keep going at this rate.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Slow down.  And then for higher
organisms, you might have a whole

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
generation before that sets it in.
Plants that make seeds, etc.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So we know that there's a problem
here.  So, people have tried to

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
introduce time lags into the
equation, and we don't have time.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I mean there's lots of really neat
things that you can do with this.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
If this was an advanced ecology
course, you'd be modeling it on your

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
computer, and putting time lags in,
and see what happens and all that

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
kind of stuff.
So we don't have time to do any of

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that.
I show you this more as a way,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I want you to learn how population
ethologists think,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
not that this is actually the most
important model that ever existed.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So how do we introduce time lags
into the logistic?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Well, the simplest way is to
introduce time.  So, we're

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
going to say dNt/dt.
Let me just make sure that's not

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:48.000
ambiguous.  dNt/dT,
is equal to r max times N at that

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:00.000
time t times K minus
Nt minus tao.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
In other words,
the density at some time,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
tao hours or days or whatever,
earlier than t, divided by K.  So,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
what this says is that the growth
rate of the population is a function

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
of the density up a little bit
earlier, or some amount earlier than

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
the time at which we're measuring
the growth rate.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So t or tao is the time lag between
sensing environments, and

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:03.000
change in growth rate.
So let's look at what that means in

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
terms of, this brings us to another
level of complexity.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So let's look at the possibilities
here.  So, with no lag,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
we have our logistic equation,
right?  The population just reaches

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
the carrying capacity
and levels off.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
With a very short lag,
and of course you have to play with

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
this to understand what I mean by
short, long, and medium because you

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
have to change all the different
parameters.  But if you have a short

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
lag, what you get is an actual
overshoot of the carrying capacity

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
in the near term because the
feedback hasn't kicked in.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
But then, it will come back and it
will level off at the carrying

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
capacity.  If you have a medium lag,
you will often see something like

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
this where you get a couple of
oscillations in here.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
But it levels off at the same
carrying capacity.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And, a long lag,
you can end up with behavior that

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
ultimately ends up in the population
crashing.  And we don't have time to

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000
analyze this, but at the end of the
lecture I'm going to come back to

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000
why this is so important in terms of
human population growth.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And for those of you who are
interested in complex systems and

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
chaos theory, the logistic equation
in its discrete form actually will

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
go chaotic for certain parameter
values.  And for a long time,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
for those of you who don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
just ignore me.  And for those who
are interested ought to spend

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
a minute on it.
For a long time,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
this equation goes into a state of
sort of chaotic oscillations,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
but that can be described
mathematically.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And for a long time,
ecologists kept looking at

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
populations trying to see whether,
indeed, they were growing according

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
to this chaos theory and it hasn't
really developed to anything,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
but it was interesting.  Chaos
theory first started coming to

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
light; the sea collision was one of
the first that people started

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
looking into, coincidentally.
But just because an equation has

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
certain properties,
it doesn't mean that thing it's

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
trying to model has those properties.
So that was a really interesting

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
development.  OK,
so let's go back to Pearl and Reed.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Where did they go?  Oh, they're up
there.  OK, so this was

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
all a digression.
So Pearl and Reed were looking at

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
the human population data,
and trying to model it.  And they

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
showed that they had this density
dependent response.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
They developed this equation in
order to describe it.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And then, they looked at the data
again using this graphical

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
formulation.
So, let's look at that.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
We're just going to use the graphic
method, because it's easier to

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
illustrate.  And now,
we're looking at the human

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
population in the US,
and this is one over N,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
dN/dt, and this is N in millions.
And so, they have some data points

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
that they put on here.
This is 1800 to 1810.  So,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
they have different data points for
different intervals,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
and their last point here was 1900
to 1910, an average of

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
the population size.
And so, they projected down here

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
there were 100 million people then.
So, they said, so they asked the

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
question: OK, we're modeling this
population, we're saying it grows

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
according to the logistic equation,
we can predict what the carrying

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
capacity in the United States for
humans by simply doing a regression

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
through this, and seeing
where it intercepts.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So, that should be the carrying
capacity.  And they predicted that

00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:02.000
we'd have 197 million when we reach
the carrying capacity.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And that was in the year 2030.
So that was a prediction of their

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
model back in the 1920s,
that the carrying capacity of the US

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
for humans was 197 million,
and that that would be reached in

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
2030.  Well, they missed it by a lot.
So, let's look at the data,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
which is not surprising.
Here's 1965.  We reached 200 million

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:47.000
way before 2030.
1990, 250 million,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:56.000
and actually today, at 10:45 this
morning, because I looked it up on

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000
my trusty population
clock on the Web,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
we had 295,979,
38 people.  This is also done by

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
modeling, we're not counting people
one at a time.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
But this website is keeping track
based on various models.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And, based on the models that we
have today, in 2030 we should have

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
about 345 million.
But these models are based on

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
something entirely much more complex
now than the simple logistic

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
equation.  OK,
so the contribution of Pearl and

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Reed was to be yet to get people to
start thinking about the feedback

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
mechanisms, how to model population
growth, and think about the feedback

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
mechanisms in that model.
You don't have that in your handout,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
but it's not important.  It's not on
the web, but if you care about it,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
there is the website that keeps
track of human population in the US.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So, here's the total population
number that I got this morning at

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
10:14 and 17 seconds off the web.
And these are just some interesting

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
statistics for the US,
and I have them for the last three

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
years: one birth every eight seconds,
one death every 13 seconds,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
one migrant every 26 seconds,
and a net gain of one person every

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
12 seconds.  So they're keeping
close track here.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
OK, all right,
so now are going to move on to

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
global population growth,
humans on the earth, the whole shoot

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
and match.  And,
there's this wonderful book for

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
anyone who's interested by Joel
Cohen, called,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
How Many People Can the Earth
Support?  And,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
it's a great book for MIT students
because it's a wonderfully nerdy

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
account.  I'm a nerd,
so I can say that.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I'm a total nerd.
But it's just a wonderful account,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
analysis, if you analyze human
population growth,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
and at the same time looking at the
phenomenon in a totally objective

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
way.  He's a theoretical ecologist.
So, this is in your textbook.  But,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
it's from this book.  And, it's from
10,000 B.C. up to here we are today,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
the population on Earth in billions.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And, this is back in the hunter
gatherer era.  We had 4 million

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
people.  And this was a small
revolution at the time,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
the introduction of the agriculture
and domestication of animals allowed

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
for higher birth rates,
and so had a little blip,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
went up to 7 million here.
And then for a long time, there was

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
just no change in human
population on Earth.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And so then, here you start to get,
I'm not sure what started this up

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
rise.  Maybe when we see the next
slide we'll see.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
No, I'm not sure what started that.
We'll have to look into that.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Maybe just the accumulation of
people that you can't see on this

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000
scale, here's the bubonic
plague, a decrease.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Here's the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution and the

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
introduction of modern medicine,
which greatly reduced mortality.  So,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
you see this incredible,
and here's fossil fuel, increase in

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
the population of humans on Earth.
So, if you look at this curve, you

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
think, oh my God,
we're in the middle of this

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
incredible exponential increase.
And, the reality is this doesn't fit

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
at all in an exponential model at
all.  I mean, if you tried to fit

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
that to our simple exponential,
it does not fit.  We are going to

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
explain what's happening here in a
minute.  So here we are at 6 billion

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
people.  And we hit 6 billion in
1999.  And here we are with a steady

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
increase.  I've just got the last
three years.  This marks the

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
lectures that I've given
in this class.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Every year I check in and see where
we are.  It's kind of a living

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
document.  And,
we're now projected to reach 9

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
billion and level off.
When I first started teaching about

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
human population growth,
the projections were at 12 billion.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And I'm not that old.  This number
keeps changing,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and luckily it's changing in the
right direction.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
We keep predicting fewer and fewer
humans before it will level off.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
But it's still 3 billion more humans
than we have now,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
and many people think now were
already beyond the carrying capacity

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
of the Earth.  So,
I'm not saying not to worry,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I'm just saying that at least it's
going in the right direction.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So, in Cohen's book, he analyzes
this, sort of the history of humans

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
on Earth as having four major
evolutionary changes where you have

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
the dramatic change in population
growth.  You have local agriculture

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
in 8000 B.C.
And, the doubling time of the

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
population before and after those
evolutions went from what he

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
estimates to be 40,
00 to 300,000 years for a population

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
to double down to 1000 to 3000 years
for the population to double.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
In other words, this is an
incredibly faster growth rate,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
because this is doubling times.
And then, with global agriculture in

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
the 1700s, again you have a
shortening of the doubling time of

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the population.
And then in the 50s with the

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
introduction of real public health
across the world,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
another reduction,
and luckily in the 70s,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
with the introduction of fertility
control, at least in the developed

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
countries, is the first time you
actually see a shift.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
We've gone from growing faster,
and faster, and faster to actually

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
growing more slowly.
The doubling time is extending.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
So, the good news is we're not in
some kind of runaway population

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
growth that's going to continue
forever.  We've already peaked out

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
as a globe, and we are going to
level off in terms humans.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And the real big question is when we
level off, will we be above the

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
carrying capacity of the Earth?
Have we overshot K?  And we don't

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000
know yet because these feedback
mechanisms haven't come back.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
So, let's now analyze this a little
bit more before we look at it in

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
that context, because this
is an important thing.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
First of all, before we do that,
I want to remind you that all of

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
these lectures are tied together
because remember this from lecture

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
20 when we were talking about
biogeochemical cycles?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And, here's the same population
size and billions on Earth,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
the brown curve.  It's smoothed over,
and these are the greenhouse gases,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
concentration of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere.  This is

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
the human footprint.
This is how we've changed the

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
metabolism of the Earth,
by this explosive growth of humans.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And one more slide just showing you
that this is another way to look at

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
it, showing that the growth of the
global population has peaked.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
So, over here, each of these is the
population in billions,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
and it basically shows you the
number of years necessary

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
to add a billion.
And you could see that it's taking

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
longer and longer to add a billion.
You can see that there is an

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
inflection point here.
So, using the tools that we've

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
developed to analyze populations,
let's look at why this growth is

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
leveling off.  What caused the
growth to begin with,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
and why it's leveling off?
And the really important feature

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
here is what's called a demographic
transition.  This is what we are

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
going through on the Earth right now
in terms of human population growth.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And, the way we look at this, we
are planning birth rates here,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
which is the pink one, and death
rate here, which is the green one.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And, when birth rates and death
rates are both uniformly high,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
which is the way it was back in the
early days when we didn't have

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
fertility control,
and we didn't have modern medicine.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
So, you had a lot of babies and a
lot of people dying.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And growth rate, and so this is the
total population.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
So, you don't have much population
growth.  Then,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
what happens, you get to a place
where you have a very

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
high birth rate.
Birth rate continues to stay high,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
but with the introduction of public
health, and modern medicine,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
we were able to keep people alive a
lot longer.  And,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
that came in advance of fertility
control.  So, what happens,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
when these two curves deviate from
one another, you have explosive

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
growth, and that's what this big
exponential shoot is.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
But then, if you then reduce the
birth rates through fertility

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
control to match the death rates,
you then have low birth rates and

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
low death rates.
Then you have no population growth,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
OK? So, it's very simple and
intuitive when you understand what's

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
going on, but I don't think that
most people really have come to the

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
point of thinking about
it like that.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And where we are on Earth today is
the developed countries have gone

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000
through their demographic transition.
And you have a sense of that just

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:55.000
from looking at family size in these
countries.  So,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000
if we look at, this is Sweden as an
example of a developed country.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
And this was 1800.
And this is 2000.  You see

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
something like this.
This is just an approximation.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
This is the birth rate and this is
the death rate,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and the population growth rate looks
something like this.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
The populations leveled off whereas
if you look at a country like Egypt

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
over the same time frame,
and you can get these curves off the

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
web easily, it looks something like
this.  You have a high

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.000
birth rate.
And death rate has gone down,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
but they're not matching each other
at all.  So, population look

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
something like this.
It hasn't even begun to level off.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
So the real trick is, in terms of
trying to level off at someplace

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
lower than 9 billion,
is to get the birthrates in the

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
developing countries to drop
as fast as we can.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And that will determine the level at
which humans will level off on Earth.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
So, let's just briefly,
let me go back over here,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
and let's go back over this carrying
capacity.  And this is basically

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
what Joel Cohen's book is about,
where he says, how many people can

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
the Earth support?
He's asking, what's the carrying

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
capacity of the earth for humans?
And here are the possibilities.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
And of course, I'm simplifying the
most complex system that we know

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000
into a simple two-dimensional graph,
but I think it's a good way to think

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000
about it.  Here's the way we've been
living on Earth.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
We have been growing like this.
Granted, we're starting to level

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
off, but we've been growing like
this.  And what we've been assuming,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.000
is that the carrying capacity will
grow with us, OK?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
We can handle as many humans as we
want to put because we,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
smart people, with technology can
increase the carrying capacity.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
If we don't have enough grain,
we'll genetically engineer to make

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
more grain.  We can fix it; we can
fix it, so let's just go with the

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
flow.  And indeed,
technology has greatly increased the

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
carrying capacity of the earth for
humans.  There's no doubt about it.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
But there's got to be a limit.  So,
is this the model that we want to go

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
by?  So, some people argue,
so, the climate, we'll fix that with

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
technology.
We can fix any of this with

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
technology, and if things get really
bad, we'll go to Mars; we'll

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
terraform Mars.
We'll colonize planets.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
That's not that far-fetched,
so why should we worry about all

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
these humans on the Earth?
We'll just figure out, we'll go out

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
and find new places.
So that's one model.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Another model is, if we're going to
do this, here's what I call the

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:12.000
optimistic model.
Well, I guess this is the super

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:22.000
optimistic model.
This one assumes that it'll do

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:33.000
something like this that we may
overshoot.  And then birth rates,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
and if you want to you can easily
describe a scenario that says that

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
we have overshot,
that this whole environmental

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
movement, the measurement of toxins
in our environment,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
the global change, all of that is
really overshooting the carrying

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
capacity.  And we wouldn't be
worrying about things that we're

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
worrying about if we hadn't overshot
it, but that if we get

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
our act together,
we won't have eroded the Earth's

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:15.000
natural system so much that we can
come back to a stable level.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And then, of course, the
pessimistic scenario is that,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
indeed, we've overshot, and we've
overshot so much that we have eroded

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
the carrying capacity,
and that we will level off at some

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
level that the Earth will no longer
be able to support the level of

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
humans that it can even support now,
that we have lost so much topsoil,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
and modern agriculture won't be able
to overcome that,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
that our water will be polluted,
that the climate will change so

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
dramatically, the fisheries will be
eliminated, yada, yada, yada.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
I shouldn't say yada,
yada, yada.  Those are catastrophic

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
things.  Erase that from the tape!
Every once in a while,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I remember I'm being taped.
So, those are bad things, not to be

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
yada, yada, yada'd.
So, anyway, this is what some people

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
are worried about,
that we are, indeed right now,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
in your lifetime and in fact mostly
in your lifetime,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
you are inheriting this,
notice the time frames on this graph.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
I mean, this is just this little
snippet of time in the history of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
life on Earth where all these
dramatic things are happening.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And we just happen to be living in
it.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Just think if you're living back
here, and thousands and thousands of

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
years went by,
and nothing changed.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
OK, so we don't have any answers,
but this is a way to think about it,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and a lot of people are putting a
lot of energy into modeling the

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
systems, and try to figure out where
we are the scariest trajectories.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
So, the next two lectures Professor
Martin Polz, who is a professor in

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
civil and environmental engineering,
and the microbiologist is going to

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
come in and talk to you about,
again, its population economy.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
He'll talk to you about population
genetics, and some really exciting

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
work that's going on in the field
now using genomics to decipher

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
evolution and population biology.
And then I'll be back with some

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
really neat DVD clips.
So, come back.

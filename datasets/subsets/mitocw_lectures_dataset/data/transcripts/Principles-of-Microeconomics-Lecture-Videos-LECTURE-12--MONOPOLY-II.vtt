[CLICKING]

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.342
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
so let's continue

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:16.550
our discussion of monopolies.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.740
Last time, we talked
about monopolies

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.670
and talked about how they're
another extreme of the market

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.750
structure spectrum.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.850
We have perfectly
competitive firms,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.150
where there's facing a
perfectly elastic demand curve,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.910
and competing with essentially
infinite number of other firms

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.960
and taking prices, versus a
monopolist who owns the market

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.000
and sets the price,
but therefore,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.790
faces this poisoning
effect, which

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.583
leads them to under-produce
and creates deadweight loss.

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:47.000
So today, we want to continue
our discussion of monopolies

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.610
with three sort of
separate topics.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.380
OK, the first topic
I want to cover

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.260
is, where do
monopolies come from?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.140
So the stork does
not bring monopolies.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.200
They come from somewhere else.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.000
So sort of, how do
monopolies arise?

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.490
And there's really two
sources of monopoly

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.480
that I want to focus on today.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.030
The first is
monopolies that arise

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.940
from cost advantages,
the monopolies that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940
arise from cost advantages.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.080
So some markets come with
a natural built-in cost

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.738
advantage for one participant.

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.030
So it could be there's an
essential input, like there's

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.690
one rock quarry in town.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.380
And whoever controls
the rock quarry,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.220
they supply the rocks
for the whole area.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.700
In that case, we say
that this is an example

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.550
of a natural monopoly.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.620
A natural monopoly
is a market where,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.370
for all relevant quantities,
one firm can always

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.840
produce at a lower average
cost than another firm can.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.870
So for all relevant
quantities, one firm

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.120
can always produce
at a lower average

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.650
cost than can other firms.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.530
OK, this basically
is the same as saying

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.580
that it's a market where average
cost is everywhere declining,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.520
at least in the relevant
production range.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.860
You can imagine where, so
for some crazy quantities,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.300
average cost increases.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.820
But where average costs
is everywhere declining

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.557
is a market with a
natural monopoly.

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:41.640
So why would this be true?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.682
Let's consider what I
think is the simplest case.

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:45.170
Let's think about
a water utility,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.760
delivering water
to people's houses

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.400
through pipes underground.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.980
Once those pipes are laid, it
is that the giant fixed costs

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.330
are paid, and the marginal
costs are trivial.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.120
It's the cost of the water.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.310
The fixed costs are so large
relative to the marginal costs

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.842
that average cost
always declines.

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:09.300
In our typical
production function,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.060
remember, average cost first
declines, then goes back up.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.460
It first declines, you
pay off the fixed costs,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.920
then back up as the rising
marginal costs start

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.638
to dominate.

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:19.680
This is a market where
that second purchase never

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.690
gets big enough, say
where, essentially,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.700
marginal productivity
is close to flat,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.060
so the marginal cost curve
isn't rising that fast, and/or

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.600
the fixed costs are enormous.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.780
So we could see
that in figure 12.1.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.065
Imagine a water utility, which
has roughly flat marginal cost.

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:44.190
That is, the marginal cost
is the cost of procuring

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.780
another gallon of water.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.850
Now once again, at
some point, if you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.350
want to give every
person in America

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.840
one million gallons of
water, marginal costs

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.040
would start to rise.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.140
But for the relevant
range, it's roughly flat.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.700
And yet there's
enormous fixed costs.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.290
You got to lay
those water pipes.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.780
So in that world, average
cost is everywhere declining.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.850
It's approaching marginal
cost, but it never

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.140
crosses marginal cost.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.300
In such a world,
once one firm has

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.459
laid the pipes that's
providing water,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.279
it never makes sense for
another firm to enter.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.750
Entry never makes sense.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.680
Why is that?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.690
Because if another firm
thinks about entering,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.120
they can say, oh, look this
water utility is making all

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.412
this money, this is a great
market to enter-- remember,

00:04:31.412 --> 00:04:33.170
we talked about
unlimited entry and exit

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.340
and perfect competition
that drives profits away.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.840
Well, let's say another firm
says, look at all this profits,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840
I want into this market.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.215
The first firm
will say, I'm just

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:42.690
going to tell you right now,
if you enter this market,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.330
I will price at marginal
cost until you leave.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.788
For the first firm,
they've already

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.372
paid to lay down the
pipes, so as long

00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:53.000
as they're pricing at marginal
cost, they're not losing money.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.720
But for the second firm,
they will lose money

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.310
if the firm stays
at marginal cost.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.140
So they'll just never enter.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.250
Because they know the first
firm has a barrier to entry.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.990
They have a natural monopoly,
having laid down those pipes.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.140
Having already paid that
fixed cost, that sunk,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.730
they will win any battle.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.130
They'll just price at
or near marginal cost

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.550
and drive any competitors
out of the market.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.840
So these kinds of essentially
natural monopolies

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.300
arise when enormous fixed
costs create a barrier to entry

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.130
when enormous fixed costs
create a barrier to entry.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.480
You can see natural monopoly.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.310
And that's one common way
monopolies arise in the world.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.740
Think of utilities.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.820
Delivering water is a
classic example of that.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.680
That's one way we
get monopolies.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.030
The second way we get monopolies
is through government action.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.190
Governments also create
monopolies remember,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.010
today I told you we talk about
governments as good guys.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.390
But still governments
can do things which

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.270
can create deadweight loss.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.030
And now sometimes,
governments do

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.060
this for a good reason, like
a natural monopoly reason,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.340
like the postal
service for example.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.938
Local postal delivery,
delivering letters locally,

00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:23.730
has all the features
of a natural monopoly.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.920
It's a huge fixed cost
of building all the post

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.740
offices and a small marginal
cost of transmitting letters

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.470
from place to place.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.030
Now however, in other cases,
this is not necessarily true.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.353
In the US, we have very few
government-created monopolies.

00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:40.520
The rest of the world,
especially in the developing,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.860
it's much more common.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.610
Many countries have
the government control

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.690
the production of steel,
the airlines are controlled

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.240
by the government ,
banking is often controlled

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.360
by the government.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.490
These are places where
probably evidence suggests

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.340
it would be more efficient to
not have the government control

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.940
this.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.930
There is no real natural
monopoly in banking.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.700
But it's more for political
reasons that they're created.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.970
But that's not really
that relevant in the US.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.950
Even the post office
isn't a monopoly anymore,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.370
with FedEx and UPS and stuff.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.580
So it's not really
relevant in the US.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.630
The more relevant for the US,
way that the government creates

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.290
monopoly is by creating
barriers to entry.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.790
The government could
create barriers

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.685
to entry, the most prominent
of which is patents.

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:32.550
The most prominent barrier
to entry is a patent.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.470
This is the case where
the fixed cost here

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.770
isn't building a pipe.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.610
It's coming up with an idea.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.340
And that basically
the government

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.030
has a law which says that,
if you have a new idea

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.010
and you patent it, you
are granted a monopoly

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.290
to sell the
resulting good for 20

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.630
years from the date of patent.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.610
So when you patent
a good, you're

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.380
granted the right to a monopoly
over that market for 20 years.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.720
Essentially, the government
is creating a monopoly.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.180
It's saying, once
you've patented that--

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.250
now remember, very
importantly-- especially

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.425
for drug development--
it's not the date at which

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:11.820
the good comes to market.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.800
It's the data at which you file.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.990
So if you file for a
patent and it takes you

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.910
19 years to develop the
product, then you only

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.930
get one year monopoly
in the market.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.810
So it's the sum.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.352
20 years is both the development
period and the sales period.

00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:26.310
You get 20 years from
the date you file.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.550
Now, patents are quite
interesting because the welfare

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.470
implications are kind of mixed.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.919
On the one hand, a patent,
by creating monopoly,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.990
creates deadweight loss.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.770
For potentially up
to 20 years, you've

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.715
got deadweight loss
in that market,

00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:47.340
because one firm has
the monopoly right

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.860
to sell the good.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.360
On the other hand, why might
patents be a good idea.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.023
Yeah.

00:08:55.023 --> 00:08:57.405
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for developing drugs,

00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:59.905
the company that can't
ever make any money off

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:01.820
of its research and
development costs

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.262
will never be incentivized
to develop it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:05.262 --> 00:09:06.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.050
Because research and development
is a huge fixed cost.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.550
And if you pay that
huge fixed cost,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.160
and the minute you develop it
someone else can just copy you,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.320
then you'd never invest
those fixed costs.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.860
We'll talk later in the
course about externalities.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.700
But you think of this as
sort of a positive spillover

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:34.700
from R&D. When firms do R&D,
when a firm invents something,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.970
it benefits everybody who
might produce that good.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.540
So if I invent something,
then everybody could copy me,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.770
could benefit.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.215
So I will not invest
in R&D unless I

00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:47.090
can be sure I might get
some money out of it.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.130
And that's what the patent does.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.920
It reduces those
spillovers by saying, OK,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.620
you get to own this for 20
years and make some money on it.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.870
Therefore, go ahead and invest.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.210
In other words,
what a patent does

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.500
is, essentially, the
government's saying,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.460
you're going to get a reward
for being first to market.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.780
And that reward is 20
years of privilege of being

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.917
a monopolist in a market.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:12.250
Therefore, that's an incentive
for you to go and invent.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.900
Yeah.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.400
AUDIENCE: What's the process
like for extending your patent?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.977
Because I know
Disney, for example,

00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:20.050
has [INAUDIBLE]
which is giving them

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.040
more years than what they had?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.095
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a very detailed concept

00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:24.560
that I don't have
enough time to get into,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.910
but there's a whole bunch of
legal battles around that.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.440
But the bottom line is,
there's a patent tradeoff here.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.100
The tradeoff is,
on the one hand,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.700
it's what we call a static
versus dynamic tradeoff, sort

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.350
of today versus the future.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.650
At any point in time, there's
a ton of deadweight loss

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.080
out there, because
monopolists who have patents

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.830
are under-producing.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.700
At the same time,
over time, we're

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.290
getting cool new products
because of patents.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.950
And that's the tradeoff.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.870
How did 20 years get picked?

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.700
Ideally, you'd have
some optimal period

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.520
to resolve that tradeoff, the
ultimate result of a tradeoff

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.448
long enough to get creation,
but short enough so

00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:06.990
that the gains on
that creation don't

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.140
exceed the deadweight
loss from monopoly.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.910
And that's an example
how a monopoly can

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.680
arise from a government action.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.700
And the point is that, for both
natural monopolies and patents,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.890
there are legitimate reasons
for monopolies to arise.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.240
So what I want to say is,
monopolies are not bad.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.200
They're not necessarily an
inherent flaw in the system.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
There are legitimate
reasons to have monopolies,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.470
both because of natural
monopoly and because of patent.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.960
But they do, at any point in
time, create deadweight loss.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.830
Yeah.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.580
AUDIENCE: Is there
a way to measure

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.475
how the impact of [INAUDIBLE]
something that receives patent,

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:51.580
like how [INAUDIBLE] that
relates to the deadweight loss

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.080
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.960
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's
a great question.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.350
There are people who do
spend their lives doing that.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.760
And basically, the
way you would do

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.190
it is you would essentially
measure the consumer

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.950
surplus created from the
new good, versus-- it

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.120
would be the triangle sizes.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.345
It would be, how much
consumer surplus would

00:12:07.345 --> 00:12:08.730
you get from the new good
versus deadweight loss

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.500
from that good sales
being restricted.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.917
Now obviously, if
it's a good that

00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:14.160
never would have existed
otherwise, by definition,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.445
the patent's a good thing.

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:17.070
Because who cares
about deadweight loss

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.153
if you never would have
had it in the first place.

00:12:19.153 --> 00:12:21.390
The question really is
about the substitutability.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.010
If you're patenting
something which

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.650
is only incrementally better,
then maybe it's not worth it.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.470
So that's sort of the tradeoff.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.770
Other questions?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:39.610
OK, so now let's talk about
addressing or regulating

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.360
monopolies.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.450
Let's go back to think about
our natural monopoly case.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.960
Let's think about our
natural monopoly case.

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:57.120
Actually, I'm going to call
this section not regulating.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.380
I'm going to call this
addressing monopolies,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.400
addressing monopolies.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.520
There are different ways that
we can address monopolies.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.310
And we'll go back to our natural
monopoly case to make it easy.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.680
The first way we
can address monopoly

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.740
is through government
regulation.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.760
So let's step back here.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.680
The bottom line is, we have
a monopoly that should exist,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.021
say a natural monopoly.

00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:23.620
It exists naturally.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.250
At the same time, that is
creating a deadweight loss.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.390
It's creating inefficiency.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.640
So the brilliance,
the insight of

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.950
the first fundamental
theorem of all for economics

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.317
was, the competition
through entry and exit

00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:38.150
will bring us the
efficient production level

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.560
and reduce deadweight loss.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.840
Here with a natural
monopoly, that doesn't work.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.010
Competition can't
work, therefore,

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.770
we end up with a
deadweight loss,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.420
because the firm that owns
the market is under-producing.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.880
This is the first case, as I
mentioned last time, of what we

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.660
call a market failure.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.520
The market outcome
is not delivering

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.810
the welfare-maximizing
result. And once there's

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.540
a market failure, there is
a potential beneficial role

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.610
for government.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.360
I said last time, with
no market failures,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.280
government's just the bad guy.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.350
With no market failures,
all government can do,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.960
it can help with
the redistribution.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.290
But from an efficiency
perspective,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.290
all the government can
do is muck up the market.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.160
But once there's
a market failure,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.700
there's a potential role for
the government addressing it.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.370
So to see that, let's return
to our monopoly example

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.320
from last time in figure 12.2.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.840
Figure 12.2 is our monopoly
example from last time.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.690
Remember, we had
demand curve that

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.170
was Q equals 24 minus
P. We had a cost

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.290
curve that delivered the
marginal cost of MC equals 2Q.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.320
And that's graphed here.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.340
And we said last time
that the monopoly outcome

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.610
would be at E sub M. The
monopolist would sell

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.710
6 units at the price
of 18, creating

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.500
a deadweight loss of C plus E.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.780
Now, what if the government
came along and simply mandated

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.797
that the monopolist was not
allowed to charge more than 16?

00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:21.130
The government says, look, I
understand it's a monopoly.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.570
I'm not going to try to
break up the monopoly.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.040
It's a natural
monopoly, whatever.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.900
Simple rule-- price
ceiling of 16.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.440
Now, when I mentioned pricing
a couple of lectures ago,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.940
you should have
learned to say, boo,

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.940
price ceilings, bad, increase
deadweight loss, terrible.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.790
But now, suddenly
a price ceiling

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.290
can actually get rid
of deadweight loss.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.390
How's that possible?

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.140
Let's take a look.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.510
In this case, the monopolist
knew marginal revenue curve

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.660
is a bit different.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.380
The new marginal revenue curve
is the old marginal revenue

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.700
curve, until you
get to the point

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.750
where the first dashed line
intersects marginal revenue.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.180
It's the old marginal
revenue curve,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.900
until you get where the marginal
cost crosses marginal revenue.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.830
Then it jumps to
the flat line at 16.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.880
Essentially, the new
marginal revenue curve

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.057
is downward sloping
till the point

00:16:28.057 --> 00:16:29.890
where marginal cost
equals marginal revenue.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.890
Then it jumps back
up to the flat part

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.130
that goes from 6 to 8.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.020
Now the exact shape
doesn't matter.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.820
It's the intuition that matters.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.410
The point is the following.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.870
Think about the
monopolist's decision.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.170
He decides, based on the
logic of the last time,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.400
to sell six units.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.900
That's the point
where the poisoning

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.867
effect offsets the benefits
of selling another unit.

00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:55.700
Now let's say the
government comes and says,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.952
monopolists, you can't
charge more than 16.

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:01.760
Well, once a monopolist
is forced to charge 16,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.530
now think about her decision
to sell the seventh unit.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.849
Well, before she didn't want
to sell the seventh unit,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.819
because selling the
seventh unit meant she

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.400
had to lower the price to 17.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.130
Well now she has to lower
the price to 16 already,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.140
so why not sell
the seventh unit?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.700
Indeed, why not sell
the eighth unit?

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.369
We've essentially gotten
rid of the poisoning effect

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.890
by pre-poisoning them, by
already telling them, look,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.020
you can't charge more than 16.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.920
There's no way to
charge more than that,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.960
so you might as well
sell eight units.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.970
So by telling the
monopolist they

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.130
have to charge a
competitive price,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.190
you will force them to sell
the competitive quantity

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.450
and you get rid of
deadweight loss.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.080
That's our first example
of how the government has

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.773
improved things.

00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:50.940
The government has gotten
rid of the deadweight loss

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.830
by setting a price ceiling.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.560
Price ceiling, in a perfect
market, is only bad,

00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.830
but a price ceiling here
can actually improve things.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.560
So that actually
sounds pretty good.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.677
So what's the problem?

00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:06.260
Why not, in reality,
just say, hey, we

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.718
can solve all our
monopoly problems

00:18:07.718 --> 00:18:09.770
by just having the
government regulate the price

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.785
at the competitive level?

00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:13.910
What's the problem, in
reality, with that solution?

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.050
Yeah.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.364
AUDIENCE: How would
the government

00:18:15.364 --> 00:18:16.420
know the competitive level?

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: How the
hell does the government

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.117
the competitive level?

00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:19.610
It's great with this chart.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.225
But in reality, the
government doesn't

00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:23.350
know where the competitive
level is because there's

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.225
two difficult points.

00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:25.933
What does the government
need to collect?

00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:27.640
First of all, the
government needs

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.435
to know what the
demand curve is.

00:18:30.435 --> 00:18:31.810
Well, it turns
out demand curve's

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:37.720
aren't written on our foreheads
or out there on the dark web.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.360
Demand curves are something
which you have to estimate.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.460
You have to gather
information from people.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.070
And it turns out that
it's pretty hard.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.680
Because if you want
to gather information

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.050
on what people are
willing to pay for apples,

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.383
you can just go to stores and
look at the prices charged

00:18:52.383 --> 00:18:53.090
for apples.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.610
But if you want to gather
information on the willingness

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.770
to pay for getting water
delivered to your house,

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.500
there's no market to turn to.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.110
It turns out to be
pretty hard to figure out

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.740
how you value a lot of goods,
which is natural monopolies.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.183
Now, you might say,
well, why do you just ask

00:19:08.183 --> 00:19:09.475
people what it's worth to them?

00:19:09.475 --> 00:19:12.160
You just say to people, look,
tell me you demand for water.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.368
It turns out that's really
hard because people aren't

00:19:14.368 --> 00:19:17.080
very good at thinking
about how to assign prices

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.370
to things they don't shop for.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.050
If I say to you,
what's an apple worth,

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.920
the first thing in
your head is, you

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.390
think about being in a
supermarket looking at apples

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.480
and what they cost.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.147
You don't think about
the inherent value

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.240
to you of consuming an apple.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.525
But when you think about
what water is worth,

00:19:34.525 --> 00:19:36.650
you have to think about
sort of the inherent value.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.930
And so you have to
rely on something

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:44.570
that we call contingent
valuation, which

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.670
is the economist's fancy
word for just asking

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.962
people what it's worth to them.

00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:52.760
The problem is, people
aren't very good about that.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.060
So for example, a
classic case was the rise

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.180
in environmental issues.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.270
How much is it worth
to have clean air?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.580
How much is it worth to
save the Grand Canyon?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.770
So it turns out people
give sort of crazy answers

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.935
that violate all the rules we
set up in the first lecture

00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:09.810
by utility functions.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.215
Like for example,
if you asked folks

00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:13.590
what it's worth
to save the Grand

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.740
Canyon as a single question,
and then you ask them

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.520
as the third question on the
list, it's worth 1/5 as much

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.150
to save the Grand Canyon was
the third question on the list,

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.472
which doesn't make any sense.

00:20:24.472 --> 00:20:26.430
It doesn't matter what
the other questions are.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.770
If you ask people,
how much they would

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.600
pay to save seals and
whales, in that order,

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:40.410
they'd say saving seals is
worth $142 and whales $195.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.140
So whales and seals
are about the same.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.040
But when you reverse
the order, whales

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.260
are worth about twice
what seals are worth, just

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.950
by reversing the order.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.560
Well, more
relevantly, if you ask

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.990
people what it's worth to
save a bird or 10 birds

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.530
or 1,000 birds or
a million birds,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.890
they give you pretty
much the same answer,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.730
which doesn't make any sense.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.330
So basically, the problem is
these contingent valuation

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.060
methods don't really
give sensible answers.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.328
And it's very hard to
get sensible answers.

00:21:05.328 --> 00:21:06.870
In my other course,
Public Economics,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.780
we talk about lots of
interesting clever methods

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.970
for trying to get people
to reveal their preferences

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.290
for these public goods.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.775
But it turns out to be hard.

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:17.150
So that's one problem, is it's
hard to measure the demand

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.240
curve.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.870
The other problem is, it's hard
to measure the supply curve.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.360
Because where does
supply curve come from?

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.000
It's sort of a firm's
marginal cost function.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.170
You as the regulator do not
know what their marginal cost

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.490
function is.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.510
So how do you find out?

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.420
You ask them.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.170
You say, hey, business
I'm going to regulate,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.090
I'd like to know what
your marginal cost is.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.310
And by the way, the
lower you tell me

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.032
it is, the lower price I'm
going to let you charge.

00:21:44.032 --> 00:21:45.240
So what's your marginal cost?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.325
Oh, god, our marginal
cost is horribly high.

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:48.080
It terrible.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.078
You wouldn't believe
it, can't complain

00:21:50.078 --> 00:21:51.870
enough about how high
our marginal cost is.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.630
And basically, unless the
regulator perfectly knows

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.460
the production function
and perfectly knows

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.585
the input prices, none of
which are perfectly known

00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:00.183
by anybody but the
firm, they aren't

00:22:00.183 --> 00:22:02.100
going to know what the
supply curve looks like

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.910
and what the marginal
cost looks like.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.481
Question.

00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:09.530
AUDIENCE: Couldn't they also,
say, in a public company,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.320
basically inspect their factory
and manufacturing [INAUDIBLE]??

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.500
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
could absolutely do that

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.150
and you can try to collect data.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.200
But ultimately, they could,
that day that you show up

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.140
with the inspector, have a
really expensive-looking setup

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.460
in their factory or whatever.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.120
It's basically very, very hard.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.292
So basically, the problem is
that regulation-- and this

00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:32.750
will generally be
a feature when we

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.420
talk about the benefits of
government intervention.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.557
We'll say, market
failure makes it possible

00:22:39.557 --> 00:22:41.390
that government
intervention can make things

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.682
better, but not definite.

00:22:43.682 --> 00:22:45.140
So the way to think
about the logic

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.230
is, in a perfectly competitive
market with no market failure,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.210
government intervention only
makes things less efficient.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.850
We're leaving
redistribution aside.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.650
It only makes things
less efficient.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.720
When you move to
markets with failure,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.510
you open up the possibility
that government intervention

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.850
can make things better, but
not for sure that it will.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.700
You open up the possibility.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.710
It's a necessary but not
a sufficient condition

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.880
for saying the government
improves efficiency.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.400
So for example, imagine
that the government came in

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.830
to this market
and said, we think

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.640
the competitive price is 10.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.460
We think the
competitive price is 10.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.470
Well, if the government
set the price equal to 10,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.810
we know that firms
are going to produce

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.533
where marginal revenue--

00:23:31.533 --> 00:23:32.950
which is now just
10, because it's

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:39.310
regulated-- equals marginal
cost, so where 10 equals 2q.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.960
Little q and big Q are the
same because of the monopolist.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.910
Where 10 equals 2q,
or where q equals 5.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.590
So if the government
comes in and says,

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.360
we're fixing your
price at 10, we

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.976
know the firm
produced five units.

00:23:51.976 --> 00:23:55.468
Well, with five units, the
deadweight loss is even bigger.

00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:58.010
The key trick with deadweight
loss triangles, deadweight loss

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.350
is essentially
proportional to how far you

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.050
deviate from the optimal point.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.470
So the more you
move to the left,

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.600
the bigger the deadweight
loss triangle is going to get.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.100
So deadweight loss
with 5 units sold

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.520
is bigger than deadweight
loss with 6 units sold.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.590
So the government's
actually made things worse.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.460
By coming and setting
this price of 10,

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.690
the government's
made things worse.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.340
Indeed, the government
could actually

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.442
set the price so
low you shut down.

00:24:21.442 --> 00:24:23.900
The government could set the
price below the shutdown point

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.970
and wipe the whole
business off the map.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.790
So here we have the tradeoff.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.290
The government can
potentially make

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.473
the market more efficient
through price regulation,

00:24:32.473 --> 00:24:33.515
but it won't necessarily.

00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.217
It depends on its
level of information

00:24:35.217 --> 00:24:36.800
and how well it does
setting the price

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.930
relative to the
competitive price.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.300
So basically, this
is a very sort

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.780
of interesting and difficult
problem for the government.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.970
So one way is
through regulation.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.250
Questions about that?

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.340
The other way to try to
address monopoly is by saying,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.930
is there some way to
introduce competition?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.740
That is, even in what feels
like a natural monopoly market,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.630
is there some way to
choose competition?

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.560
So for example, think
about broadband delivery.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.670
Now we're still wired.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.660
In the future,
it's all wireless.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.410
This is different.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.085
But it's still wired.

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.710
The way it works is,
broadband delivery

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.350
has features of a
natural monopoly, which

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.400
is, someone has to lay the wires
to your house to deliver it.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.680
At the same time, once
those wires are laid,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.090
it's a 0 marginal cost to allow
you to connect to the internet.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.970
So what governments do in other
countries, but not the US--

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.920
in the US, we have competition.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.070
Everybody lays their
own lines down.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.460
In Europe, they recognize
that's inefficient.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.460
It's a natural monopoly.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.220
What they do is, they have one
set of publicly laid lines,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.330
and you compete to deliver
content over those lines.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.890
So there's competition where
the monopoly is not natural,

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.542
which is over the
speed and the quality.

00:26:03.542 --> 00:26:05.000
It's the quality
of the connection.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.700
But the lines themselves, since
that's a giant fixed cost,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.035
they realize there can't
be competition over that.

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.660
So that's one way
you could try to deal

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.730
with a natural monopoly.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.670
In other words, the
government could

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.753
control the pipes underground
delivering the water

00:26:15.753 --> 00:26:19.220
and have firms compete over
delivering the water to you.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.820
So that's one way
to deal with it.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.510
Another example is to think
about the public sector

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.580
and think about education,
education delivery.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:36.110
Now, for those of you
who grew up in the US,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:40.060
you are evidence of the success
of the US educational system.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.750
But you are the
exception, not the rule.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.000
The US educational system,
by international standards,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.950
performs very badly.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.840
Probably out of the
top 30 countries,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.480
we're like 15th in terms
of things like math scores

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.460
and other things like that.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.890
Yet, we spend more
money per pupil

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:01.120
than any other
educational system

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.910
in the world by a large amount.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.440
So if you look at figure
12-3, figure 12-3 shows,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.040
in the blue, primary
school spending per pupil,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.320
and in the red, eighth
grade math scores.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.030
And you can see the US spends
way more than other people,

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.405
but our scores
aren't any better.

00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:19.905
Indeed, it doesn't
look like there's

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:21.820
a very strong
relationship here at all

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.650
between how much countries spend
and what you get in return.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.510
But at least it's
quite striking how low

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.360
the US is given how
high our spending is.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.120
Now, why is that?

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:42.630
One reason is because we have
given local schools a monopoly.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.183
We have said to
local schools, you

00:27:45.183 --> 00:27:47.850
have a monopoly where you get to
deliver the education to anyone

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.892
who lives within a certain
radius of your school.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.190
We've created that
natural monopoly.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.300
And once we created
that natural monopoly,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.672
we reduce pressures on firms
to produce efficiently.

00:28:02.672 --> 00:28:04.880
We've essentially said to
firms, you have a monopoly.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.173
There's no reason you have
to produce efficiently.

00:28:08.173 --> 00:28:09.590
Because there's
no entry and exit,

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.790
which can put those
pressures on you.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.480
So in some sense, that's a
government-created monopoly.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.060
Your local public school is a
government-created monopoly.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.775
So what can we do for that?

00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:22.400
What can we do?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.440
Well, we can actually
introduce competition.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.070
So for example, we can
have public school choice,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.170
which many cities now
have, where, in fact, you

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.500
don't have to go to the
school in your neighborhood.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.110
You can try to go to any
school in the district.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.657
You can essentially
enter a lottery

00:28:39.657 --> 00:28:41.990
and try to move around to
other schools in the district.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.510
And that introduces competition.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.927
Because then the
schools that want

00:28:44.927 --> 00:28:47.770
kids will have to
be better and have

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.176
to produce more efficiently.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.517
And then a further
mode of that is,

00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:57.725
you can have charter schools.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:06.270
Charter schools are publicly
funded, but not city provided.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.860
They're in between public
schools and private schools.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.560
Charter schools are
separate schools,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.290
which get funding
from the government.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.635
But they aren't under the
local government's control.

00:29:18.635 --> 00:29:20.510
Regulatory control, but
they aren't delivered

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.550
by the city as education.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.570
And that provides more public
school choice for individuals.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.810
And there's a lot of evidence,
much of it by my colleagues

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.000
here at MIT, which
shows that there's

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.250
been enormous benefits
to these movements,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.835
that public school choice
and charter schools

00:29:36.835 --> 00:29:38.460
have delivered-- now
I know some of you

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.250
might have seen the John Oliver
segment a couple of years

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.875
ago where he ragged
on charter schools.

00:29:41.875 --> 00:29:44.400
I mean, I love him in general,
but he was wrong on that one.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.925
There's a couple of bad actors.

00:29:45.925 --> 00:29:47.300
But by and large,
charter schools

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.550
have been an enormous benefit
to the education system

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:54.080
by introducing competition
and allowing students

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.070
an option to improve their
educational outcomes.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.970
Now, the furthest out
option, and something

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.785
you'll hear a lot of
discussion of, is vouchers.

00:30:07.956 --> 00:30:10.890
The most radical option is
what we call public school

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.605
vouchers, or just vouchers.

00:30:13.605 --> 00:30:14.730
Here's how this would work.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.897
This is a very popular idea
on the conservative side

00:30:16.897 --> 00:30:17.940
of the spectrum.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.150
Here's how this would work.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.030
So I live in Lexington.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.640
What that means is, if I
send my kid to a Lexington

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.440
public school, it's free.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.360
But the minute I pull
my kid out and send him

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.000
to a private school, it
costs me the entire amount.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.250
So imagine a Lexington public
school education's worth

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.610
$10,000.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.660
I'm essentially getting
$10,000, conditional on sending

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.100
my kids to a Lexington school.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.892
The minute I choose to
send them elsewhere,

00:30:45.892 --> 00:30:49.420
I literally give
up that $10,000.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.490
A voucher system would
say, the way it would work

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.770
is, everyone in town
would get a check

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.040
or would get a
voucher for $10,000

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.218
to be used at any
school they want.

00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:01.510
So if you want to go in
Lexington, you just hand it in.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.190
Life's never changed.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.040
But now if you want to
go to private school,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.460
we're allowing you to
take your money elsewhere.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.110
That puts competitive
pressure not just

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.488
on schools within the district
but on the whole district.

00:31:12.488 --> 00:31:14.280
The whole district now
says, wait a second,

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.760
if we don't do a
good job, people

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.906
are going to leave and
take their money elsewhere.

00:31:17.906 --> 00:31:21.630
So the idea is to actually
set up broader competition

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.550
to put pressure on districts
to improve their performance.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.600
So this has been a
longtime attractive option

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.630
to many economists.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.740
And I've spent a whole long time
talking about the pros and cons

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.180
of this in my other class.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.330
But briefly speaking, the
pros are all the reasons

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.420
we like competition in markets.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.920
It'll cause more
production efficiency

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.140
because schools would
have to compete.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.150
The cons are numerous, though.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.357
One con is, you then have to
have the public sector that

00:31:51.357 --> 00:31:53.690
has a vested interest in
making sure private schools are

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:57.000
delivering a public
quality education.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
So basically, you could set up
a private school that is just

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.980
a football training academy.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.440
And suddenly, people could take
their voucher and go there,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.160
and suddenly they
wouldn't get education.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.950
That's one con.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.820
Another con of these systems
is that they're expensive.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.667
So take me.

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:16.500
I live in Lexington.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.780
I'm a pretty rich guy.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.870
I sent my kids to
private school.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.130
I sent them and I paid.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.140
Now, imagine Lexington
had a voucher system

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.050
and they give me a
check for $10,000.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.415
Why should Lexington give a
relatively rich guy $10,000?

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.290
That's sort of silly.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.290
I was already sending my
kids to private school.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.600
So who would be the big winner
from a system like this?

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.100
Well, some winners
would be kids who

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.790
then get a better education.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.280
But a lot of winners would be
rich people who already sent

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.060
their kids to private school.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.500
We'd just be
handing them checks.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.090
That's not a great outcome.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.810
So there are
definitely tradeoffs

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.470
inherent in a system like this.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.762
I know there's a few questions.

00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:52.887
Let's do a couple of
questions, then we'll move on.

00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:53.880
Yeah, in the back.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880
AUDIENCE: So say you
have these vouchers,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.760
and instead of going
to the public school,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.880
students are leaving to the
private school, and then

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.370
the fixed cost of having
the infrastructure

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.220
of a public school, that's then
spread out over less students.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.440
So how do you account for, the
price of teaching one student

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.590
might go up if there are these
students that are leaving?

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.570
JONATHAN GRUBER: That
is an awesome question.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.370
There's two elements to that.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.890
Question one is, there is an
actual natural monopoly feature

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.590
to local public education.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.190
So remember, competition
doesn't make sense when

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.575
it's a true natural monopoly.

00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:30.200
There is some natural
monopoly element.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.290
So as you shrink the
number, you suddenly

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.850
are raising the average cost.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.350
And that is a potential problem.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.517
There's an efficiency issue.

00:33:37.517 --> 00:33:39.230
There's also an
equity issue, which

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.410
is, who uses the
vouchers and leaves?

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.815
The people with motivated
parents who are with it.

00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:44.690
Who gets left behind?

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.730
People's parents who don't
give a shit about him.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.522
There's an equity issue,
too, of, suddenly,

00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:50.993
you're pulling all the smart
kids, all the motivated kids

00:33:50.993 --> 00:33:52.910
out of the public schools
and leaving the kids

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.260
behind who aren't motivated or
whose parents aren't motivated.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.420
There's an equity
issue there, too,

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.545
so that's another tradeoff.

00:33:57.545 --> 00:33:58.396
Yeah.

00:33:58.396 --> 00:33:59.890
AUDIENCE: You got
a good education.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.500
JONATHAN GRUBER: How do you tell
if people get a good education?

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.440
Well, that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.140
AUDIENCE: Well, if you're
going to get a good education.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's another problem.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.420
Which is, competition, one of
our fundamental assumptions

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.909
of perfect competition
was perfect information.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.130
That's fine when you're
looking at apples or maybe

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.870
even computers.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.760
It's not so easy
looking at schools.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.527
Now, schools
publish test scores.

00:34:21.527 --> 00:34:24.110
You can look at the test scores
of kids who go to that school.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.818
But once again, that's
not that reliable,

00:34:25.818 --> 00:34:27.735
because if smart kids
are going to the school,

00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:30.170
they'll have high test
scores, even if teachers suck.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.750
For example, Harvard--
sorry, I couldn't resist.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:42.090
So basically, you
can't really tell that.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.469
In other words, there's
a number of failures

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.739
of the private
education market, that

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.568
are a problem with this
kind of voucher solution.

00:34:51.568 --> 00:34:52.860
But it doesn't mean it's wrong.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.810
It means it's interesting.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.699
There's a tradeoff.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.653
On the one hand, we'd
introduce competition,

00:34:57.653 --> 00:34:59.820
which would maybe increase
efficiency in the market.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.420
On the other hand, there's
a lot of market failures

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.620
which might get in the way
of this functioning properly.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.670
Fascinating topic, and if
you want to learn more,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.920
I urge you take 1441.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.740
We spend a whole lecture
talking about it.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.790
So that was the second
topic I want to talk about.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.310
Once again, we've
started down the road

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:22.380
of questioning the wisdom of the
market, so the road of market

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.263
failures.

00:35:24.263 --> 00:35:25.680
The first market
fail is monopoly.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.260
We've talked about the
pros and cons of trying

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.650
to deal with monopoly.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.110
But I want to talk
about one other topic

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.820
before we leave
monopolies, which

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.320
is this topic of what we call
contestable markets, which

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.440
is sort of an informal term.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.988
But I really like
it as an intuition,

00:35:43.988 --> 00:35:45.530
so I'd like to spend
some time on it.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.440
Contestable markets are monopoly
markets without market power

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.150
or without much market power.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.950
That is, we talked
about monopolists

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.020
as having lots of market power.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.080
Remember, we said the markup
was essentially proportional.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.830
We said that monopolists
had a markup, price

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.100
minus marginal cost over price,
which is equal to minus 1

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.320
over the elasticity of demand.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.000
That was their markup.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.818
And so you know some markets,
different monopoly markets

00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:19.610
will have different
levels of market power.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.902
You can be a monopolist, but
not have much market power

00:36:21.902 --> 00:36:24.130
if consumers are very elastic.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.940
But there's another reason
why monopolists face pressure

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.290
besides the
elasticity of demand,

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.008
which is, in some sense, the
size of the barrier to entry.

00:36:34.008 --> 00:36:36.425
So one reason monopolists are
constrained in their pricing

00:36:36.425 --> 00:36:38.750
is because demand's elastic.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.180
Another reason is because
the barriers to entry

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.080
might not be that large.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.670
So you could think
of it, roughly

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:49.180
speaking, for a given
elasticity of demand,

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.733
the larger the barrier to entry,
the more market power you have.

00:36:52.733 --> 00:36:54.400
Because the larger
the barrier to entry,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.650
the more you can be sure no
other firm's going to come in.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.330
Or in other words,
the amount to which

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:02.530
you can charge above marginal
cost for a given elasticity

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:07.500
is proportional to how severe
the barriers to entry are.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.950
If there's no way a second firm
can get in, then essentially,

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.730
you get to just
obey this formula.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.073
But if a second firm
can get in easily,

00:37:16.073 --> 00:37:18.490
then you might not even be
able to have this big a markup.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.948
Because if you try,
someone's going

00:37:19.948 --> 00:37:22.600
to come in and
steal your profits.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.840
So in other words, there's
essentially an important issue,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.540
which is that the
market monopolists can

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.232
get as a function both of
elastic demand and the size

00:37:31.232 --> 00:37:33.270
of their barriers to entry.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.170
This is an important
issue that came up

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.120
in the area of airline
deregulation, which

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.280
is what I want to talk
about for a few minutes.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.920
It's an important application
of the kind of stuff

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.170
we've been talking about.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:53.220
Now, how many of you
have seen Mad Men.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.875
Jeez, really?

00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:55.250
Wow, OK, it's a
pretty good show.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.520
I mean, it's not outstanding.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.230
How many have seen Breaking Bad?

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.007
OK, good.

00:37:59.007 --> 00:38:00.090
That, you have to all see.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.042
Mad Men's pretty good.

00:38:02.042 --> 00:38:03.750
But basically, what's
nice about Mad Men,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.880
it shows what flying was
like when I was a kid.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.220
When I was a kid, when you
flew, it was like luxurious.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.590
You went on, there was
plenty of leg room.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.440
You had free meals, free
movies, free drinks.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.970
And the reason was because--

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.590
I sort of skipped
ahead in the story.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.530
When I was a kid,
airlines were regulated.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.330
What that meant was
that, essentially,

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.870
the government viewed airlines
as a natural monopoly.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:39.790
They said, look, planes
are very expensive.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.722
There's a big fixed cost,
so it's a natural monopoly.

00:38:42.722 --> 00:38:44.680
We don't think competition
will work well here,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.962
so we're going to have
regulation of airlines.

00:38:46.962 --> 00:38:48.420
What that meant
was, the government

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.300
set the price of every
flight and regulated

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.040
where planes could go.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.720
So airlines every
year would submit

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.390
a set of routes they wanted
to fly and a set of prices.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.970
And the government would
approve or turn them down.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.745
It was a regulated market.

00:39:02.745 --> 00:39:05.120
And it was generally viewed
that the government basically

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.580
sort of screwed this up
and set the rates too high.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.600
That was sort of
the general view,

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.825
that, basically, government,
because, essentially, they

00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:12.575
didn't really understand
the supply curve,

00:39:12.575 --> 00:39:14.583
they were being
fooled by the airlines

00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:17.000
to think costs were higher
than they were and were setting

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.700
prices too high.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:24.380
But economists said, look,
this is not a natural monopoly.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.900
Because in fact,
it's not actually

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.120
that cheap to get a used
plane and enter this business.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.240
Because these companies turn
over their planes all the time.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.612
And yes, buying a new
plane's expensive.

00:39:37.612 --> 00:39:39.320
But getting a
well-functioning used plane

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.640
isn't that expensive.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.730
And you could easily create
competitors in this business.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:47.780
They said it was what we called
a contestable market, a market

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.830
with very low barriers
to entry, that, in fact,

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.800
if you allowed competition,
you would have a lot of entry

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.907
into this market.

00:39:55.907 --> 00:39:58.490
And it would function fine, that
it wasn't a natural monopoly,

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.535
it was a contestable market.

00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:03.910
And they argued, in fact, that
if you lacked competition,

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.580
price would fall very
close to marginal cost.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.270
Price could fall very
close to marginal cost.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.980
So in fact, economists
carried the day.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.540
In the 1970s, we deregulated
the airline industry.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.570
The government stopped setting
prices and regulating routes.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.950
What happened?

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.880
OK, three things happened.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.150
The first thing is,
price fell enormously.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.940
The cost of flying
fell by about 1/3.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.830
The best example was the airline
I took home from MIT in 1984

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.760
called People Express.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.260
People Express
Airlines introduced--

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.100
this was sort of shortly
after deregulation.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:49.100
I could fly from Boston
to Newark for $29.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.728
Now, how did that work?

00:40:50.728 --> 00:40:51.270
It was crazy.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.790
You showed up at the airport.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.873
There was no reservations.

00:40:53.873 --> 00:40:55.160
You just waited on line.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.580
They let people on until
the plane was full.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.040
Then you waited
for the next one.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.062
You paid on the plane
with a credit card.

00:41:00.062 --> 00:41:01.520
I still to this
day don't know what

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.340
happened if you didn't pay.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.370
Did they throw you
out the window?

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.170
I don't know.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.870
But you paid on the plane.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.550
And it was incredibly
competitive.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.633
And this is what happened.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.480
Flying got incredibly cheap.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.910
The second thing that happened
is you had many more routes.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.630
It turned out that
the government

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.580
thought that flying
from point A to point B

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.532
wasn't profitable
often when it was.

00:41:23.532 --> 00:41:25.990
So the government wouldn't let
airlines flight from point A

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.730
to point B, when,
if fact, airlines

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.850
could make plenty of
money doing that flight.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:34.570
So you had cheaper
flights and more routes.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.840
The third thing
is, flying sucks.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.050
When I was a kid,
flying was awesome--

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.600
meals, booze, big seats.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.820
Now it's terrible-- no
meals, no booze, tiny seats.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.447
Why?

00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:54.280
Why did this happen?

00:41:56.352 --> 00:41:58.310
Flights got cheaper and
there are more of them,

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.980
but why were they
suddenly crappier?

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.660
Yeah.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.160
AUDIENCE: There was
more competition

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.880
so they were trying to bring
down the marginal cost so bring

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.990
prices lower.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.032
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right,
that's one way to put it.

00:42:10.032 --> 00:42:13.600
But the point is, what
this example points out

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.350
is that there's
always competition.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.090
Yeah, what were
you going to say?

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.350
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say price discrimination.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.720
They could discriminate based
on what people [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.290
JONATHAN GRUBER:
It actually wasn't.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.070
They still price discriminate.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.360
It wasn't quite that.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.430
But yeah.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.670
AUDIENCE: People were
willing to fly [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: They
were willing to fly.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.800
But what were they doing before?

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.740
Yeah.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.520
AUDIENCE: If you couldn't
compete on price,

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.592
you could compete
on luxuriousness.

00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:36.550
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.020
So there were multiple
airlines before.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.020
The government said we'll
only compete on price.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.130
But they said, great, we'll
compete on other stuff.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.830
Remember, economic actors
want to be economic actors.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.937
They want to use economic tools.

00:42:47.937 --> 00:42:49.520
So if the government
says to airlines,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.900
we're not going to let
you charge a higher price,

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.275
they're like great,
we'll compete

00:42:52.275 --> 00:42:56.420
by having better food,
better drinks, bigger seats.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.830
Once the government
said, now you

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.320
have a new mode
of competing, they

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.485
realized people
weren't willing to pay

00:43:02.485 --> 00:43:04.610
for better food and better
drinks and bigger seats.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.483
They'd rather fly cheaper.

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.150
So they switched the
mode of competition

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:12.050
from quality competition
to price competition.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.450
They used to use
quality competition.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.000
Now they use price competition.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.150
This means that all of us who
complain that flying sucks

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.140
should just shut up.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.060
Because if we really
cared that much,

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.370
then there'd be a good airline
that charged more and gave you

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.083
better stuff.

00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:28.750
But there's not.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.350
I mean, JetBlue's
a little better.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.490
But by and large,
there's not airlines

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.820
that charge more and
give you better stuff.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.570
And that's because,
at the end of the day,

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.090
we would rather fly cheaper
than have this extra stuff.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.680
It wasn't worth the money
that we were paying for it.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.180
Which really says that
regulation was failing here.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.430
Regulation was forcing
airlines to compete

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.120
in an inefficient way.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.320
They're competing by giving us
nice meals when we would rather

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.970
have the money.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:02.350
So it was an example
that regulation failed.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.610
So that's all really good news.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.050
But there's one piece of bad
news, which is that, economists

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.670
aren't all-knowing.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:13.690
And the economists, there's
a fourth outcome we missed,

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.090
which was the rise of
the hub and spoke system.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.740
Which is that what we
missed is that airplanes

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:27.460
aren't a natural monopoly,
but airports are.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.720
And what airlines started
doing is essentially

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:36.190
taking over airport
slots, and then saying,

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.760
we are going to have
all the flights.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.593
So for example, my wife
is from Minneapolis.

00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:42.440
We used to go to Minneapolis,
the only option was Northwest.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.200
Northwest owned all the slots
in the Minneapolis airport.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.450
And they'd say, if you ever
fly anywhere on Northwest,

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:51.025
we're going to route you from
Minneapolis to wherever you go.

00:44:51.025 --> 00:44:52.650
It was called the
hub and spoke system.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.650
You always went to a
central point and went out.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.220
So US Air had Pittsburgh.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.960
Northwest had Minneapolis.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.290
American had Dallas, et cetera.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.040
They had these hubs
that you'd go through.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.720
What that meant was,
they essentially

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.480
got a monopoly on the
route into the hubs,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.457
because they had monopoly
on the slots in the airport.

00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.290
Now you might say, well,
that's easy to fix.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.030
Don't give monopoly
slots in the airport.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.838
But that's harder to
fix than you think.

00:45:15.838 --> 00:45:17.630
Because whenever the
airport in Minneapolis

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.590
would say to Northwest, we
want to allow other airlines,

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.320
they'd say, great, we're
moving our headquarters out

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.050
of Minneapolis.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.050
See ya.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.590
And they'd say, OK,
fine, we won't do that.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.850
So essentially, there
became political equilibrium

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.462
where these local airlines
were such big employers,

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.170
they'd bully the
governments into letting

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.090
them dominate the airports.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.730
And they essentially
recreated a monopoly.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:39.590
But the monopoly
wasn't on planes.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.450
It was on airport slots.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.050
And actually, flying got
much more expensive again.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.742
So the price of flights
really came down

00:45:46.742 --> 00:45:48.950
until airlines figured out
this hub and spoke system,

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.242
and they've gone back up since.

00:45:50.242 --> 00:45:52.850
Now, they're still cheaper than
they were under regulation.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.660
But roughly speaking, the price
fell by more like more than 50%

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.880
initially, and then
sort of risen back up.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.917
It's still lower than
it was under regulation.

00:46:00.917 --> 00:46:02.500
But it's risen back
up because there's

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.810
this sort of new
natural monopoly problem

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.880
that we didn't see.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.310
So that leads to crazy
things, like a price

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.250
of a nonstop to
San Francisco today

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.250
is something like half
as much from Boston

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.660
as a flight to Minnesota.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.990
Now, I don't know how
your geography skills are,

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:20.865
but San Francisco's a
lot farther from Boston

00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:23.690
than Minnesota is, so it's
clearly not a marginal cost

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.100
issue.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.360
So that's an example.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.330
It's sort of a nice
case study of kind of,

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.360
our motivation was right, by and
large economists got it right.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.510
By and large, we're better
off in a deregulated world.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.145
But not as well
off as we thought,

00:46:37.145 --> 00:46:39.520
because we missed this other
element of natural monopoly.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.840
Why don't I stop there.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:50.150
We will continue next time
by talking about oligopoly.

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:27.380
PROFESSOR: Let's go
back to our discussion

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.430
of spectral broadening.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.780
And what I started
to derive for you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.310
is perturbation theory of
spectral broadening, which

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.190
is a very general framework.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.182
I like it, because
it really provides

00:00:45.182 --> 00:00:47.530
you insight into
spectral broadening.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.270
But I will also hope it
provides new insight for you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.670
for time-dependent perturbation
theory [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.590
So what we did in
this lecture is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.370
we pretty much did standard
type perturbation theory.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.773
We just did it by
assuming that we

00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:10.210
have a general
time-dependent perturbation.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.910
I'm not yet telling you what the
time-dependent perturbation is.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.076
It has actually fluctuating.

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:15.384
It has inhomogeneous.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.760
It has everything in
it which will later

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.250
lead to line-broadening
line shifts.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.470
And the important quantity which
is now describing everything

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.872
we are interested
is the correlation

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:35.500
function between the
perturbation at time t

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.020
pi and t.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.030
And we call this
correlation function G.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.360
And it is either the
correlation function G of t,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.820
or it's Fourier
transform, which tells us

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.950
what the excitation
rate of the system is.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.930
I want to give you sort
of two summaries now.

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.539
And they're both general
to perturbation theory.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.610
But I have to say, I
myself learned something

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
about time evolution of quantum
systems from those examples.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.295
So what we get is a
very generic thing,

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:23.753
that when we look
at the probability

00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:28.220
to be in the final state,
the amplitude V of t squared,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.226
we start out quadratic, a very
general behavior of any quantum

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:34.990
system, because your linear
equation, which linearly

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.430
puts amplitude into the
excited state is quadratic.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.526
And also, this is the beginning
of a Rabi oscillation.

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:45.290
The Rabi oscillation
starts out with 0 slope.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.280
But then you have some
de-coherence type.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.140
The fields are no longer driving
the system in a coherent way.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.710
And then that's where we
enter the regime of Fermi's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.930
golden rule, the probability
to be in the excited state

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.770
only goes linear.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.570
And this is when we
have rate equations.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.620
Let me sort of show how it
comes about in equations,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.725
which I think is really nice.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:21.312
The differential equations
is that in a time delta t,

00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:25.150
we add amplitude delta
t to the excited state.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.210
And so the amplitude
we build up is--

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.410
I may have called an h bar.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.120
Or maybe I measured
[INAUDIBLE] frequency units.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.600
It's just the matrix
element times delta t.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.790
And we usually call
the matrix element

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.350
the Rabi frequency over 2.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.410
So you should think
about it, that we

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.800
add sort of this amplitude.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.997
And as long as we
are coherent, I

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.744
have to take the amplitude
1/2 the Rabi frequency delta,

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:53.130
then square it.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.650
And here, you get the
quadratic behavior.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.160
This behavior you also have
constructive interference.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.062
All those delta [INAUDIBLE] are
added in a phase-coherent way.

00:04:05.062 --> 00:04:09.555
But this behavior ends, of
course, at the coherence time.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.515
Let me just get my notes.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.600
So when the time becomes
comparable to the coherence

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:48.370
time, then we are adding
amplitude not as constructive

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.580
interference-- we are
adding B squared [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.420
becomes sort of a
[INAUDIBLE], and we

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.560
add things in quadrature.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.925
So what happens is at
the coherence time,

00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:08.980
we have created
an amplitude which

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.580
is given by this expression.

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:22.760
But now if time goes by,
we add in quadrature t

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.350
over tc chunks of that.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.560
So therefore, our B square,
which we build up with time,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.270
is linear in time
and is omega Rabi

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.980
squared over 4, the matrix
element times the coherence

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.715
time tc.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.720
And this here now is our
rate in the rate equation.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.090
And this is also what
we exactly got out

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.680
of the correlation
function formalism.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.490
So this is how you
should think about it.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.200
You go from constructive
interference

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.350
in amplitude and adding
things in quadrature.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.560
Let me maybe add one more
discussion to it, which I hope

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.500
will help you to
see the big picture.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.900
We have a matrix
element V. And if I just

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.720
ask you, think about
Fermi's golden rule,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.890
you would find out
that the rate is

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:34.910
V square times the density
of states at the resonance.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.890
And sometimes instead of
the density of states,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.200
you write a delta function,
which is just a placeholder

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.044
that you should do
an energy integral.

00:06:45.044 --> 00:06:47.818
And then you get the
density of states.

00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:48.730
OK.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.590
So this is sort of
Fermi's golden rule,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.180
and it should be old hat to you.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:05.940
But what I told you now is
that what is involved here

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.340
from the time integration is the
correlation function, V of 0,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.300
V of t as two different types.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.220
But then because of
the type integration

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.090
of Schrodinger's equation,
we had a time integral dt.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.590
But V of 0, V of t, remember,
we have a correlation

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.150
between the field V of 0.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.470
And then it decays with time.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.700
This here can be written
V of 0 squared times

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.190
the correlation time tau c.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.860
So therefore, the
correlation function,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.060
it's a general formalism.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.990
It allows us to deal with
all time dependencies.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.130
But in essence, the
time-integrated correlation

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.064
function is nothing
else than your operator,

00:07:51.064 --> 00:07:52.480
your perturbation
operator, time t

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.240
equals 0 squared times
the correlation time.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.160
And the correlation time, the
inverse of the correlation

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.500
time, is the spectral
widths of your drive field.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.390
And this is what
the spectral widths

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.310
is in Fermi's golden rule.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.990
On the other hand, if you do
the integration V of t dt,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.610
think about it as
Fourier transform,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.640
it gives us actually
some V of omega.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.560
It gives us the
Fourier transform.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.350
Well, I see it omega.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.440
If you just do V of t
dt, you get the Fourier

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.131
transform at 0 frequency.

00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.714
But if you look
through the derivation

00:08:32.714 --> 00:08:35.350
we did that was an
e to the i omega

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.559
resonant term, which we
were just spitting out.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.309
So we have sort of shifted
the origin of frequency.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.695
So therefore, the
Fourier transform,

00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:46.580
if I correct for this just
offset infrequency which

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.240
I introduced for
simplicity, this

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:57.010
is nothing else than asking
whether the drive field has

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.280
a Fourier component
which can resonate

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.900
the drive to transition.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.850
And we talked last class
about the convolution.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.880
This gives actually
the power spectrum.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.700
It keeps the Fourier
transform of it squared.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.060
But the power spectrum is, of
course-- when you take a field

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.560
and fully analyze
it, [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.430
is the power spectrum, the whole
power and the whole intensity

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.800
of your laser, of your
field is spread out

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.560
over the banquets of the source.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.040
So when you say, the power
spectrum, the power spectrum

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.652
is automatically intensity
divided by spectral widths.

00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:34.110
And that's where
the delta function

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.090
and the spectral widths in the
normal formulation of Fermi's

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.840
golden rule come in.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.420
So I'm just emphasizing
I haven't really

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.170
done anything new than just
giving you a general notation.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.070
And I would actually
say-- whenever

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.640
you were asking yourself
about Fermi's golden rule,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.020
this is the full [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.851
This is about a fully
time-dependent arbitrary time

00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:55.350
field.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.330
And you realize, what was
re-squaring Fermi's golden rule

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.050
is actually just
the simple case,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.360
the more general case--
and the more general case

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.950
is it's a correlation
or it's a power spectrum

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.820
which creates the rate
in Fermi's golden rule.

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:17.636
Any questions about that?

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:21.790
OK.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.089
So we have this
powerful formalism.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:28.380
So all we have to do is when
we want to understand what

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.720
is the rate and
the spectral widths

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.820
of the spectroscopic
features is we

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.490
have to understand what is
the field driving the atom.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.500
And then we take the
Fourier transform,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.490
or we figure out what
the correlation is.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.450
We take V of 0 squared
times the correlation time,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.730
and we know what the rate is.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.100
And this will allow
us major insight

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.330
into spectral broadening.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.260
OK.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.245
But after introducing
that in general,

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:02.230
I think it's time
for a simple example.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.850
And as a simple
example, I just thought

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.590
I'd show you how we get
the natural line widths.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.000
And of course, the
natural line widths--

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I've mentioned several times,
we need Optical Bloch equations.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.780
We have to really
kind of capture

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.410
the interplay between
the coherent drive

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.910
of the atom and the
spontaneous decay.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.900
But just
phenomenologically, if I

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.410
say the excited state has a
decay rate of gamma over 2,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.000
I mentioned it
before, we can capture

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.740
some aspects of
spontaneous decay.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.990
And that means now,
remember, our spectral widths

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.830
comes from the correlation
function of the matrix element.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.160
And now the operator
is constant,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.970
but the state is decaying.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.470
So therefore, the matrix element
has this exponentially decaying

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.620
function.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.100
And if you then ask,
what is the correlation

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.650
function at time 0 and
time tau, we get this.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.590
Of course, the Fourier transform
of an exponentially decaying

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.400
function is a Lorentian.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.630
And I've shown you now with a
different formalism that yes,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.680
if you have dampening in the
excited state, for instance,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.980
you do spontaneous decay,
we get the Lorentian.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.470
Of course, we know there should
be power broadening, too.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.020
But of course, don't
expect power broadening

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.180
from a perturbative approach,
because a perturbative approach

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.330
is only valid when we
have weak drive fields.

00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:42.580
Questions?

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.900
OK.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.236
So now I want to-- after
this simple example,

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.100
I want to explain to
you Doppler broadening.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.250
I know I will
present it in a way

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:06.143
and draw some conclusions
which are usually not done

00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:09.540
in the normal presentation
of Doppler broadening.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:18.270
So what we have to bring in now
is that we have moving atoms.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.764
That's what Doppler
broadening is about.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.270
We drive the field with
an electromagnetic wave.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.180
And we have usually ignored
the spatial dependence,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.700
assuming the atom was
clamped down in c equals 0.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.960
But now we have to
allow for motion.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.760
So the relevant matrix
element for which

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.570
we want to calculate
the correlation function

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.065
has now a spatial dependence.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.722
And our correlation
function, G of ba,

00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:05.720
involves now-- I call
the Rabi frequency now

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:15.470
x for, well, simplicity
of-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.911
took this material,
because they use it.

00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:18.410
OK.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.640
So now we have the
correlation function.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:27.100
We have the temporal
part, t prime minus t.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.880
But then we have a spatial part.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.300
And this is now
the new part which

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:38.586
has to account for that the
atom is moving from one position

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.578
to another one.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.390
And when we calculate
the correlation function,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.525
we have to average
now over the velocity

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:51.794
distribution of the atom.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:15:00.560
So this new part, which will
account for Doppler broadening,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:07.370
I called this part I. And
z of t prime minus z of t

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.882
is simply the velocity
of the atom times tau.

00:15:12.882 --> 00:15:15.250
Tau is t prime minus t.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.530
So atoms move by that.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:25.940
And v is the z component
of the velocity.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.680
So now we have to
calculate that.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.930
And of course, we
assume that we have

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.400
a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.560
We assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.420
And then our
expression I, we have

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.900
to convolute-- we have
this term, e to the kv tau.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.380
But now we have to
convolute it with

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.110
the one-dimensional
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.550
where alpha is the
most probable velocity.

00:16:12.202 --> 00:16:15.300
And since the velocity
distribution is normalized,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:24.230
we have this p [? vector. ?]
Alpha is the most probable

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:31.596
speed, and mu is the mass
of the-- sorry, it's not mu,

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:33.193
it's M. And M is the
mass of the atom.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.240
This integral, of course,
can easily be solved.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:59.165
And we find that provides--
[INAUDIBLE] Gaussian envelope

00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:03.530
with time tau, so it's
exponential-decayed with time

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.630
tau.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:16.470
And our rate, which
is the matrix element,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:24.970
involves now the
temporal integral over--

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.060
let me just scroll up.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.680
In our correlation function,
we had a temporal part

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.390
and a spatial part.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.318
And the rate-- this was
Fermi's golden rule--

00:17:36.318 --> 00:17:38.568
is the time we've taken over
the correlation function.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:51.120
So therefore, we have the
exponential [? vector ?]

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.710
in time.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:58.970
After convolution with the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.870
we have this exponentially
decaying term.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.046
And the result of
that is, well, hooray,

00:18:06.046 --> 00:18:10.610
we have re-derived
the Gaussian profile

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.112
for a Doppler broad light.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.130
OK.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:33.080
But yes, we want to look at
this result with some new eyes,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.400
because until now,
you would have said,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.540
OK, that's really trivial.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.150
Each atom has a velocity.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.040
Galilean transformation
into the moving frame

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.680
means the frequency has shifted,
and everything falls together.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.356
And yes, that's one
way to look at it.

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:49.400
In inhomogeneous broadening,
each atom has its own velocity.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.220
But now we want to look
at it from the viewpoint

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.750
of a correlation function
describing the whole system.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.820
So we had calculated this
correlation function,

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.870
which the atomic
ensemble experiences.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.405
And this correlation
function here

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:12.420
decays as a function of time.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.235
And it decays with a
characteristic time.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.510
Tau c, which is 1 over k alpha.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.180
And this is nothing else than
the reduced wavelengths lambda

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.210
bar divided by the
most probable velocity.

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:43.600
OK.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.580
So we want to relate
the line widths

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.500
to some form of coherence.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.495
And what we realize
is the coherence

00:19:54.495 --> 00:19:57.470
time of the correlation
function, which needs Doppler

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:03.740
broadening, is the time it takes
an atom with the most probably

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.600
velocity to move one wavelength.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.290
But wait.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.990
What we have is, in the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.890
the most probably
velocity is also

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.230
the widths of the velocities.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.670
So therefore, what we can say
is, if all the atoms would

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.600
start at one position, after
the correlation time tc,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.250
the atoms have spread
out over one wavelength.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.400
So therefore, the
correlation time

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.070
tells us how long is the whole
ensemble driven coherently.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.410
But once the atoms,
due to their motion,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.770
spread out compared to
their initial position,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.370
while extra
wavelengths, each atom

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.555
experiences now a different
phase of the drive field.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.820
And that sets a limit
to the coherence.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.750
And this is the point where
when we ask how many atoms

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.970
are getting excited, we
can no longer add amplitude

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.430
in a constructive, linear way.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.820
We are adding amplitudes
in quadrature.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.639
And this is exactly
what I explained to you

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.014
at the beginning
of this lecture.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.310
So let me just summarize it.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:26.140
Alpha is the thermal
spread of velocities.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.720
So the keyword is here.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:50.370
Atoms, in a random way,
spread out by lambda

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.124
in the coherence time tc.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.310
Well, a question which should
come to your mind is now,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.225
but what happens when the atoms
are in an atom [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:11.840
and they cannot spread out?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.520
That's what you want to
discuss in a few minutes.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.110
But before I do
that, let me give you

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:28.940
another interpretation,
which is helpful.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.200
You can regard-- if you
have a thermal ensemble,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.640
you can say, OK, I have a box.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.230
Each atom is a plain wave
with a perfect velocity,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.430
and now an ensemble of that.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.420
But very often, especially
if you do localized physics,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.170
you want to regard each
atom as a wave packet.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.210
And if you want to use
a localized description

00:22:51.210 --> 00:23:01.710
of your gas, where
atoms are wave packets,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:07.080
then you assume, in a
consistent description,

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.350
that the atoms are spread out
due to the momentum spread

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.990
in the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:19.230
This is nothing else
than h bar divided

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.786
by the mass and the most
[INAUDIBLE] velocity.

00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:25.500
And this is foregoing
[? vectors ?]

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.665
on the order of unity, nothing
else than the thermal de

00:23:30.665 --> 00:23:33.530
Broglie wavelengths.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.340
OK.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.190
So now we have the
picture that the atom

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.840
is a wave packet in
the ground state.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.985
But now we excite
it with a laser.

00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:50.450
Well, if we excite it with a
laser, part of the wave packet

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.880
goes to the excited state.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.110
But the atoms in
the excited state,

00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:00.130
because they have absorbed the
photon recall of the photon,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.320
are now moving away
from the ground state

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.625
part of the wave packet,
with the recall velocity,

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:12.100
with this h bar k over M.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.800
So if I regard
the atom as a wave

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.450
packet, the natural
question is, when

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.770
does the ground state
of the wave packet

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.332
lose overlap with the excited
state part of the wave packet?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:40.716
Lost overlap after time--
well, I derive it for you.

00:24:40.716 --> 00:24:43.500
But it can only be
the coherence time.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:54.550
So the time is the
size of the wave packet

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:01.150
divided by the recall velocity.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.380
The mass cancels out.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.070
H bar cancels out.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.570
And this is 1 over k alpha.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.930
And this was exactly
our coherence time.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.130
So therefore, when
I'm telling you

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.250
you should understand
this picture,

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:25.710
Doppler broadening is a loss
of coherence for the ensemble.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.150
You have now two
ways to describe it.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.350
One is you can say, in a
more quantum mechanical way,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:40.410
after the coherence
time, the recall velocity

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.490
has separated the
grounded, excited part

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.825
of your wave packet.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.750
Or you can say, when the
atoms in the ensemble

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.762
have a velocity
spread of alpha, then

00:25:57.762 --> 00:26:02.740
they have spread out by
the optical wavelengths.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.750
So these are two
equivalent picture

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.188
to understand why this ensemble
is no longer coherently driven.

00:26:12.972 --> 00:26:13.472
Yes?

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:18.169
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in both
of the curves, like, why is,

00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:20.168
in the first picture, the
optical wavelength not

00:26:20.168 --> 00:26:23.500
relevant; in the second one,
[INAUDIBLE] not relevant?

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.356
[INAUDIBLE] distance.

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:31.890
PROFESSOR: Well, because these
are two different pictures,

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.865
but the results agree.

00:26:33.865 --> 00:26:37.314
I mean, the wavelength comes
into the picture with the wave

00:26:37.314 --> 00:26:39.510
packets through the
recall velocity,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.666
because the recall
velocity is h bar k over M,

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:44.270
and k is the
inverse wavelengths.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.138
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:26:45.138 --> 00:26:48.310
But when we write delta t
there, we write [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.466
the wavelengths off
the packet here,

00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:54.418
and we could have also
just thought of it as,

00:26:54.418 --> 00:26:58.354
when does the atomic
ensemble become

00:26:58.354 --> 00:27:00.322
bigger than the optical rate?

00:27:00.322 --> 00:27:02.290
But here, we are [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.245
PROFESSOR: I think
for consistency-- I'll

00:27:06.245 --> 00:27:07.250
give you a quick answer.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.260
I should think about it
longer, but what we usually

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.450
assume when we describe
atoms by wave packets,

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.680
we assume the atoms
are not cooled

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.860
below the so-called
recoil limit.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.760
So we assume that the thermal
de Broglie wavelengths

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.410
is shorter than the
optical wavelengths.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.232
And so then if you would
say, you would expect also

00:27:27.232 --> 00:27:29.440
that there would be something
happening when the wave

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.370
packet spreads out by
an optical wavelength,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.670
I want to think about it more.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.800
But the quick answer
is, just assume

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.967
what is usually the
semi-classical limit

00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:39.745
of these kind of
pictures, where we

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:43.900
assume that we have a hierarchy
that the thermal de Broglie

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.242
wavelength is much larger
than the size of the atoms

00:27:46.242 --> 00:27:47.950
but smaller than the
optical wavelengths.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.227
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:27:49.227 --> 00:27:50.852
PROFESSOR: A few
things happen, really,

00:27:50.852 --> 00:27:54.030
in intuitive pictures
when you cool atoms

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.440
before the recoil limit.

00:27:58.221 --> 00:27:58.720
OK.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.690
There's one reason why I would
like to express it to you.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:09.270
Armed with that knowledge,
if I would now ask you--

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:14.220
you have a trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate,

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.814
and you take the spectrum.

00:28:18.814 --> 00:28:20.563
What is the Doppler
widths of the spectrum

00:28:20.563 --> 00:28:21.813
of a Bose-Einstein condensate?

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:27.180
[INAUDIBLE] extra
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:27.846
No.

00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:29.150
The condensate is different.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.430
It's in one quantum state.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.710
But now you can
choose your picture.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:43.130
One picture you can take is
you can say, the de Broglie

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:48.440
wavelengths here has to be--
you know, the wave packet loses

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.590
overlap when the
excited state moves

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.250
one de Broglie wavelength.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.360
But the condensate
is fully coherent.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.930
So you would now say,
maybe I should think about

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.750
if-- if the
condensate part of it

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:04.850
is coupled to the excited
state, and with a recoil,

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.800
the excited state
component has moved

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.900
the size of the condensate,
replacing the de Broglie

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.380
wavelengths by the
size of the condensate.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.340
And this is a correct answer.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.380
You would then find out
what is, quotation mark,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.206
the Doppler broadening
of a condensate.

00:29:24.206 --> 00:29:25.705
Of course, you could
have also said,

00:29:25.705 --> 00:29:27.950
the condensate is
a certain size,

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.240
h bar divided by the size is
the momentum spread if you

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.300
do Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.790
And now I plug in
this momentum spread

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.650
into a formula for the
Doppler broadening.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.320
And you would get
the same result.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.000
But especially when you think
in terms of a coherent wave

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.400
function, this picture of losing
overlap between the two parts

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.190
of the wave packets is very
intuitive, very useful.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.970
And it actually guided
a lot of our intuition

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.254
when we looked at the
limitations of super radians

00:29:59.254 --> 00:30:02.218
and optical spectroscopy with
Bose-Einstein condensates.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.906
Any questions?

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.110
OK.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.315
So now we are ready to
take it to the next level.

00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:21.120
When I told you that
the spectral widths

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.370
is the inverse of
the coherence time.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.860
And one way to think
about the coherence time

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.040
is that the particles spread
out over one wavelength.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.390
So if you take this
thought seriously and say,

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.792
what happens if I confine atoms
in a container or an atom trap

00:30:38.792 --> 00:30:41.264
to less than the
optical wavelengths,

00:30:41.264 --> 00:30:42.680
then you would
say, they can never

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.190
spread out by an
optical wavelength.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.280
Does it mean that the
coherence time is now infinite

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.790
and that we can do spectroscopy,
which is no longer affected

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:58.550
in any way by
Doppler broadening.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.240
Well, what I just
motivated in words

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.020
is the so-called Lamb-Dicke
limit of tight confinement.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.230
And as I want to show
you now, yes indeed,

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.560
you have a very,
very sharp line which

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.350
is not broadened by
Doppler broadening, which

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.960
is not shifted by
the recoil shift.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.590
It's really the unperturbed
line of the atom which

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.030
can be probed by confining
the atoms to less

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.890
than a wavelength.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.950
So therefore, let's
now discuss the line

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.150
shape of confined particles.

00:31:46.645 --> 00:31:48.020
So what I want to
present you now

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.070
is we have particles trapped
in a harmonic oscillator.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.130
And in one limit, which
I want to explain you,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:32:00.830
we should just find the normal
Gaussian Doppler profile

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.910
which we have
obtained for free gas.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.950
This must be the limit when
the [INAUDIBLE] confinement is

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.020
very weak.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.490
But for tight confinement,
we should actually find,

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.230
unless we assume other
means of line broadening,

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.510
a delta function
spectral feature.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.170
And I will explain to
you that this is actually

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.360
the same as the
Mossbauer effect.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.660
It's a Mossbauer line
due to the confinement.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:38.040
So therefore, to have
trapped particles

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:53.854
allows us to go to the
ultimate limit in precision

00:32:53.854 --> 00:32:54.395
spectroscopy.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.420
What happens when you
have trapped particles--

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.580
the Mossbauer effect,
which I mentioned,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.210
or simply the effect of
confinement-- in other words,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.600
the trapping potential
is completely

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.910
eliminating the Doppler effect.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.430
But I want to be specific.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.863
It only eliminates the
first-order Doppler effect.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.940
Everything I just did with
the correlation function

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.940
assumed first-order
Doppler effect.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:49.010
If you want to get rid of the
second-order Doppler effect,

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.310
then you need some
form of proving.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.810
But usually, when
you do experiments

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.990
with trapped particles, you
do confinement and cooling

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.740
at the same time.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.210
OK.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.960
Let me start out with
very basic things.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.635
So let's talk about the spectrum
of an oscillating emitter.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:29.316
If we have an atom, it undergoes
a transition from excited state

00:34:29.316 --> 00:34:33.909
b to excited state a,
this is an internal state.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.440
But now we want
to include motion.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.650
And we have to include the
external degree of freedom.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.930
And for our discussion right
now, the external degree

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:46.090
of freedom is [INAUDIBLE]
trapping potential.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.330
So now we look at the
combined system, combined--

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.310
we can say Hubert
space, which combines

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.120
external and internal motion.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.090
And of course, the external
motion is now quantized.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.355
I can't assume, but it doesn't
really add anything to it

00:35:08.355 --> 00:35:09.980
at this point-- that
the trap frequency

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.400
and the ground and excited
state are different.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.755
I simply assume that
the trap frequency omega

00:35:16.755 --> 00:35:19.080
trap is the same.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.620
This, of course, is excellently
fulfilled in ion traps.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.920
If you reduce spectroscopy of
neutral atoms in a dipole trap,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.660
of course, the ground
and excited state

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.250
may experience a
different AC stark shift.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.220
And then you have to account
for two different frequencies.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.550
But let me just make this
simplifying assumption.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:53.690
So if you assume that
an atom emits radiation,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.260
it will, for energy
conservation,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.030
emit at the electronic energy.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:10.530
But then there is an extra
term, which, in general, is

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.380
the energy of the
external motion,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:16.530
or the trapping potential
for the initial state

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.500
minus the final state.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.530
And if we now make our
simplifying assumption

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.000
that everything is harmonic,
that hyper-potential

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.570
is harmonic, and the
trapping frequency

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.920
is the same in the excited
state and the ground state,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.852
we simply have the electronic
energy plus n quanta--

00:36:37.852 --> 00:36:41.170
n is the change of the number of
quanta of the harmonic motion.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.610
I want to point out,
it looks so trivial.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.280
But you should at least
think for a second

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:58.230
about this statement, that this
formula includes the Doppler

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.586
shift and the recoil shift.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:18.282
And of course, this is trivial,
because we are talking here

00:37:18.282 --> 00:37:21.370
about the total energy
of the external state,

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.990
the total energy of the final
state after photon emission.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.160
And the energy and
the trapping potential

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.790
includes all the kinetic
energy of the particle, which

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.270
includes whatever comes
from [INAUDIBLE] velocity

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.329
or from the motion of the atom.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:49.670
So therefore, we obtain what is
called the sideband spectrum.

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:56.910
I'll just show you
a stick diagram.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:01.220
Here is the
electronic transition.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.550
And then we have sidebands.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.310
And the spacing
of those sidebands

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.640
is nothing else than the
harmonic oscillator frequency.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.225
Any questions?

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.620
At that level, I want
you to appreciate

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.080
that this is radically different
from Doppler broadening.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.580
There is no Doppler broadening.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.365
By fully quantizing the motion
in the harmonic oscillator,

00:38:32.365 --> 00:38:36.210
we obtain a discrete spectrum.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.810
And what I want to show
you is when we calculate

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.460
the intensity in the peak
for strong confinement,

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.770
almost all of the intensity's
in the central peak.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.020
And therefore, there is
no Doppler broadening.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.350
But I want to later
show you how we

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.090
can go from the discrete
spectrum back to the Doppler

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.235
broadening which we just
described in free space.

00:39:07.719 --> 00:39:09.760
You should say, well, but
the motion, the recall,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.440
it must come in.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.570
Where is it?

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.270
Well, it's not in
this stick diagram.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:19.460
But the sticks are
the only possibilities

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.459
for the possible photon
frequencies or photon energies.

00:39:23.459 --> 00:39:25.250
But the question is,
what is the amplitude?

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.554
What is the probability
that this will happen?

00:39:28.554 --> 00:39:30.220
And you already see
where I'm aiming to.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.011
In the limit that we
have many, many sticks

00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:34.020
and we are not
resolving the sticks,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.650
we will get back to them in the
standard Doppler broadening.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.770
So the big question is, how
many of those sticks do we have?

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.570
Are we in the limit where
things are heavily discrete?

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.660
This is our new limit?

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.380
Or do we have
many, many of them?

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.725
So therefore, the recoil
and the velocity, they

00:39:48.725 --> 00:39:53.430
really enter when we
calculate the intensity.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.430
And whatever our formulation
is with Fermi's golden rule,

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.755
the rate is proportional
to the relevant matrix

00:39:59.755 --> 00:40:01.240
element squared.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.218
And now I want to show you
how we calculate those matrix

00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:08.194
element.

00:40:08.194 --> 00:40:09.170
You had a question?

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.336
AUDIENCE: But is it true
that each of these sticks

00:40:12.336 --> 00:40:16.816
has the intrinsic line
width of the atom?

00:40:16.816 --> 00:40:17.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.013
We come to that
in a few minutes.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.890
I ignore here the
spontaneous broadening just

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.580
for pedagogical reasons.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.170
But a little bit
later, I will-- I first

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.290
want to sort of discuss
the number of sticks.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.790
Do we have a few?

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.386
This is sort of new, then
we have only few sidebands,

00:40:36.386 --> 00:40:38.300
and we have the
Mossbauer effect.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.831
If we have many, that's sort
of more the continuum, which

00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:44.080
we described with the classical
velocity distribution.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.390
That's my message number one.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.220
But then the next message
is, do we resolve the sticks?

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.670
Do we have resolved
sidebands or not?

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:55.410
And for that, the criterion
is, is the natural line widths

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.446
large or smaller than
the sideband spacing?

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.980
It's not just one parameter;
there are two parameters.

00:41:04.982 --> 00:41:06.940
One is which will be the
Lamb-Dicke parameter--

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.530
how many sticks do we have?

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.780
And the second question is,
do we resolve the sticks?

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.821
And you can say there are
four different regimes,

00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:16.007
you know-- yes or no for
question one, or yes or no

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:18.810
for questions two.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.350
Other questions?

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.850
OK.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.040
So the rate is proportional
to the matrix element squared.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.950
And yes, we have all kind of
the matrix elements involving

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:31.940
the internal degree.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.150
But the new thing is
the matrix element

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.710
for the center of mass wave
function of the atom, which

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.730
is-- you can see just
the emission where

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:52.040
the polynomials of the
harmonic oscillator.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.890
So we have the eigen functions
for the harmonic oscillator

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:59.540
between initial and final state.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.780
And what acts on the only part
of the electromagnetic field

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.450
operator, which acts on
the position of the atom,

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.860
is this term, e
to the minus ikr.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.290
OK.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.200
I mentioned already
that the new regime

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.040
is that the
confinement is tight.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.200
So let's just look
at this situation.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:36.080
When kr is much
smaller than 1, then we

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:44.370
can expand this exponential
into 1 minus ikr.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.130
And now I want to remind
you that the position

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:52.170
operator, when we treat
the harmonic oscillator,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.160
is nothing else than
a plus a dagger.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.700
So therefore, if kr is
small and therefore we

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:07.780
can do the first-order expansion
of e to the ikr, our spectrum,

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:13.550
our operator is here-- 1 minus
e [? vector ?] a plus a dagger.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:20.300
And therefore, the
only possible sidebands

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.020
are the one where the
change in harmonic

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.630
oscillator quantum number
is plus or minus 1.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:35.305
So we are already
obtaining the result,

00:43:35.305 --> 00:43:39.200
which is called the
Lamb-Dicke limit when

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.230
kr is much smaller than 1,
that we have a strong carrier.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:50.110
We have only sticks-- the
delta n equals plus, minus 1.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.460
And the intensity in
each of those sticks

00:43:53.460 --> 00:44:02.290
is actually proportional
to k squared r squared,

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:09.214
which is nothing else than
the square of the extension

00:44:09.214 --> 00:44:10.380
of the atomic wave function.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.520
And k is 1 over lambda
bar squared, divided

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.880
by the optical
wavelengths we get.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.685
So we see already-- I mean,
without any major formalism

00:44:24.685 --> 00:44:27.550
or mathematical
tools-- what happens

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.615
in the limit of
tight confinement.

00:44:30.615 --> 00:44:33.820
The spectrum of confined
particles is eclectic,

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.490
the spontaneous line widths.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.840
A delta function without
any Doppler shift,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.780
without any recoil shift, right
at the resonance frequency,

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.220
electronic frequency
of the atom.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.713
The only thing
which is reminiscent

00:44:51.713 --> 00:44:53.170
of the motional
degree of freedom

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.340
are those small satellites.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.770
But their intensity goes
to 0 with the extension

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.570
squared over lambda squared.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.850
So therefore, if you
confine the particle

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.790
to less than an
optical wavelength,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.800
the older picture I told
you, it can never spread out

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.630
over wavelengths,
can never get out

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.740
of coherence with
the drive field.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.840
And here, we have a
quantitative description

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.690
that at that moment,
we can obtain

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.150
spectroscopic information
about the resonance completely

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.550
unperturbed by motional effects.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.711
Questions?

00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:45.210
OK.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.350
So that was maybe
the most fun part,

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.560
the extreme limit and
you realize what happens.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.980
But now we want to sort
of fill in the gaps.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.637
I first want to sort
of contrast what I just

00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:02.595
described to you with a
semi-classical picture.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.770
The semi-classical picture-- if
you have an emitting oscillator

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:17.860
or absorber and we have
electromagnetic plane wave,

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:24.910
we can now ask, what is
the phase of the plane wave

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.820
experienced by the atom?

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:31.950
And of course, the
phase is affected

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.184
by the motion of the
atom if we assume

00:46:35.184 --> 00:46:39.630
the atom moves [INAUDIBLE]
with harmonic frequency omega

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.000
t and an amplitude x0.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.475
Then this here is the
phase seen by the atom

00:46:47.475 --> 00:46:50.540
in its own reference frame.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:55.970
And if I then define-- with
another quotation mark,

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.900
because it's sort of something
which needs explanation.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.660
If I define an instantaneous
frequency, which

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.761
is nothing else than the
derivative of the phase,

00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:12.130
then I'll retrieve the
normal Doppler broadening.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.438
So now you see where sort
of normal Doppler broadening

00:47:14.438 --> 00:47:16.270
would come in.

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.563
But the question is, you
cannot measure an instantaneous

00:47:19.563 --> 00:47:20.250
frequency.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.450
It would violate
the Fourier theorem.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:28.470
But if we can apply-- if the
atom oscillates slowly enough--

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:33.200
the motion is slow enough
that we can apply the concept

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.910
that we can look at the
frequency the atom experiences,

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.650
you would at least say, before
the atom changes its velocity,

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.645
it should see a few cycles.

00:47:42.645 --> 00:47:46.960
If it oscillates fairly fast,
this concept, of course,

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.070
cannot be applied.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:52.020
But at least you see where your
normal Doppler shift comes in.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.030
It comes in in the concept of
an instantaneous frequency.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.020
Of course, what we
should do now is

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.598
we should not take the concept
of the instantaneous frequency.

00:48:02.598 --> 00:48:04.988
We should do rather
do it correctly.

00:48:04.988 --> 00:48:08.340
What we have is we see we
have the phase of the atom.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.240
So therefore, we
should-- by using

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.736
the motion of the atom
for x, we should have

00:48:15.736 --> 00:48:18.470
formed Fourier transform.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.710
The Fourier transform
tells us what

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.020
is the tonal spectrum
which the atom experiences.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.702
So therefore, we
take this plane wave,

00:48:29.702 --> 00:48:32.770
we put in the oscillatory
behavior of the atom,

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.684
and then we take away transform.

00:48:41.145 --> 00:48:41.650
OK.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:46.430
So the electromagnetic
field seen by the atom

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:52.530
is an amplitude which is
the cosine of the phase.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:56.920
And the phase has a
temporal dependence

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.040
that's just the frequency
of the plane wave.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.500
But now the precision
involves the oscillation

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.800
of the atom at the
[INAUDIBLE] frequency omega t.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.069
And what I've introduced
here is the data [? vector ?]

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:14.360
is called the modulation index.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.550
This is the relevant quantity.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:20.480
It is k, which comes from
the plane wave, e to the ikr,

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.465
times the amplitude of the atom.

00:49:22.465 --> 00:49:26.310
And so the modulation
index is nothing else

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:34.170
than the amplitude of the atomic
motion divided by the reduced

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.230
wavelengths of the light.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.400
Just if you remember for a
second, this extreme stick

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.720
diagram where we had one big
stick and two smaller sticks,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.690
remember, the intensity
in the smaller sticks

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.460
was the extension
of the atom divided

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.310
by the wavelength squared.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.230
So we had exactly
the same parameter,

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:59.180
but the previous description
assumed a quantized picture

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.010
for the harmonic oscillator.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.120
I really used a and a daggers
in the atomic wave function.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.210
This is a semi-classical
picture where

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.410
I treat the
oscillation of the atom

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.520
in a classical description.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:15.410
But in both cases, of course,
the relevant parameter

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.722
is the ratio over
which the atom moves--

00:50:18.722 --> 00:50:20.450
the amplitude of
the atomic motion

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.860
or the size of the atomic
wave function in relation

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.651
to the wavelengths of the light.

00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:28.150
OK.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.420
So we want to Fourier
transform this function.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.950
And this gives us the spectrum.

00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:40.005
I can show you
that the result is

00:50:40.005 --> 00:50:52.730
that we can have a Fourier
expansion of this amplitude,

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.240
and it involves basal functions.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.160
So it is the basal
function Jm which tells us

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.610
what the intensity is
in the n's sideband.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.420
And the argument of
the basal function,

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.550
whether we take the basal
function at the origin

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:16.024
or at a finite argument, is
given by beta modulation index.

00:51:16.024 --> 00:51:18.545
You can't immediately
[INAUDIBLE] in just two lines.

00:51:18.545 --> 00:51:20.960
We write the Fourier transform.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.755
All you have to use
is those identities

00:51:24.755 --> 00:51:28.671
which involve the
basal function.

00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:31.170
Whenever you have the cosine
of a sine or the sine of a sine

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:34.960
and you Fourier
transform, you get,

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.312
naturally, basal functions.

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:41.930
OK.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:45.320
So let's just look
at the result.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.590
We talked about
the stick diagram.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.060
The stick diagram was actually
motivated quantum mechanically.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.585
But now we also find a stick
diagram purely classically

00:51:56.585 --> 00:52:00.630
because of the periodic
motion in the harmonic trap.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:04.010
But now what we obtain in
the semi-classical limit,

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:07.850
we obtain what is the
height of each stick.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:11.960
Well, the height of the stick,
which is n sidebands away,

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.590
is given by the square of
the n's basal function.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.690
And beta is the
modulation index.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:22.570
And if beta goes
to 0, that means

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:24.330
the atom is not moving at all.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.130
The amplitude x0 is 0.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.770
This is the limit of
tight confinement.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:33.730
Then all basal functions
are 0 except the 0's order.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.870
And that means we are back
to a single delta function,

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:39.023
a single stick in
our stick diagram.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:00.420
So let's now take the
result and discuss it.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.280
So how does the
spectrum look like?

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:15.300
Well, I want to give you
two limits where the atom is

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.050
extended much larger
than the wavelengths.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:21.940
This means large modulation
index beta and small modulation

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.510
index beta.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:52.750
But first, in the limit where
beta is large-- for large beta,

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:59.150
the argument of
the basal function

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:11.235
becomes just cosine
beta minus phase.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:36.870
So if we use that-- if we assume
a thermal distribution where

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:43.380
beta over kt d beta squared.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.240
So we take our spectrum,
and we just convolute it

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.650
with a thermal distribution
of amplitudes x0, which

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.850
is, of course, just
the Boltzmann factor.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:55:04.660
And in that limit, we
actually obtain a spectrum

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:11.180
where the envelope of the sticks
looks like the Doppler width.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:16.330
So if those two
conditions are fulfilled,

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:21.002
then we obtain the
normal Doppler widths.

00:55:21.002 --> 00:55:26.420
If, in addition, we assume
that the sidebands are not

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.700
resolved, because the
natural line width

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.090
is larger than the spacing.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.390
So if we assume
that in addition,

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.060
then we just find
the normal Doppler

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:45.107
broadening how we have
derived it as in free space.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.780
So normal Doppler
broadening is the limit

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.404
of the large modulation
index, a thermal distribution

00:55:54.404 --> 00:55:59.240
of modulation index in the
case of not resolved sidebands.

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:08.460
The opposite limit,
of course, is

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:15.350
when beta is much
smaller than 1,

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:19.150
it means the amplitude of
the oscillating particle

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.960
is smaller than the wavelengths.

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:27.050
I mentioned it a few times,
so I should write it down.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.320
This is the Lamb-Dicke regime.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:37.980
And then the relevant
approximation

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:43.896
for the basal function
is in the limit.

00:56:43.896 --> 00:56:52.450
And this limit is 1 over n
factorial times beta over 2 n.

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:58.620
And for the case that n
is 1, this is just beta.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:02.050
And the amplitude
squared is beta squared.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.650
It's x0 over lambda
squared, as we

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.480
had discussed before in
the quantum mechanic unit.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.940
So you'll see that
to use matrix element

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:15.430
for the harmonic oscillator or
use a semi-classical Fourier

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.170
transformed with a basal
function, both lead

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.080
to the same result, that
deep in the Lamb-Dicke limit,

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:25.250
we have essentially three peaks.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.280
And the satellites
are quadratically

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:38.062
small in the modulation
index squared.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:52.390
So this regime is particularly
interesting for atomic locks

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.010
and for meteorological
applications

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.720
if the sidebands are resolved.

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:01.540
If the sidebands
are not resolved,

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.880
you have sort of a line
shape which depends,

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.885
let's say, on temperature,
because x0 squared,

00:58:06.885 --> 00:58:11.970
if it's the thermal excitation,
is proportional to temperature.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.690
So as you cool it
down, you will actually

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.940
see that your line
shape changes.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:23.609
But the good thing is that
once you resolve the sidebands,

00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:25.150
the line shape of
the central carrier

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.090
does not change anymore.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.390
And once you can
resolve the sidebands,

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.640
you can just observe
the central carrier,

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.430
and you obtain
spectroscopic information

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:37.673
which is no longer blurred,
which is no longer affected

00:58:37.673 --> 00:58:39.770
by motion or by temperature.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.970
And that's, of course, a regime
where the atomic frequency

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:45.844
standards want to operate.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.240
Questions?

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:08.050
OK.

00:59:10.942 --> 00:59:12.388
Yes.

00:59:12.388 --> 00:59:15.930
Let me just write that down,
because this is important.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:34.420
For resolved sidebands,
you have sharp lines,

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.720
no motional broadening.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.580
And the physics I
described to you

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:53.610
is actually analogous
to the Mossbauer effect.

01:00:00.894 --> 01:00:05.580
In the Mossbauer effect, the
intensity of the recoil-less

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.580
emission of this recoil-less
line is described

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:16.060
by the [INAUDIBLE]
[? vector. ?] So in this case,

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:21.076
the [INAUDIBLE] [? vector ?]
is 1 minus the probability

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.840
for the two sidebands.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.170
So the same concept of
Mossbauer line and [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:31.950
[? vector ?]
describes the physics

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:33.294
for tightly confined particles.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.250
So if I use the analogy
to the Mossbauer effect,

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:52.010
the Mossbauer effect is called
the recoil-less emission

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.190
and absorption of x-rays.

01:00:54.190 --> 01:01:04.310
So what we have here is we
have a recoil-less absorption

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:06.284
and emission of photons.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.850
Of course, the photon which
is emitted and absorbed

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:13.160
has momentum.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.040
There should be momentum recoil.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.140
So the question is, where
does the momentum recoil

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:23.600
go when the confined
particle emits or absorbs

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.310
on the carrier of
the central line.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:31.620
How do we reconcile
the result I derived

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.928
for you with momentum
conservation?

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.000
A trapped particle,
tightly confined.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.270
And photon comes, has
momentum, the atom absorbs it.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.200
But the spectrum does
not show any evidence

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.712
for recoil shifts and such.

01:02:01.465 --> 01:02:01.965
Colin.

01:02:01.965 --> 01:02:03.923
AUDIENCE: Must be absorbed
by the trap somehow.

01:02:03.923 --> 01:02:06.930
PROFESSOR: Must be
absorbed by the trap, yes.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.380
Your trap is anchored
in the laboratory.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.200
And you transfer the momentum.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.990
The atom is attached
to the trap.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:14.830
The trap is attached
to the laboratory.

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:19.020
So the object which
takes over the momentum

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.290
is your whole apparatus
or, in the extreme case,

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:23.110
a whole building.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:26.140
And there is, of
course, a kinetic energy

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.820
associated-- momentum
squared over 2 m.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.300
But the mass is now the
mass of the building.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.340
So therefore, there is
no energy associated

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.180
with absorbing the recoil.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:42.260
So it is as if-- and this comes
back to some earlier remarks

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.280
I've made-- is
that when you have

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.850
this absorption in
the Lamb-Dicke regime

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.170
is it is as if your
two-level system has

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.850
an infinite mass behind it.

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:56.530
And that's sort of the situation
how I told you you should often

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:58.680
think about it,
you should separate

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.890
effects of the internal
degree of freedom

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:02.690
and the external
degree of freedom

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:05.020
by just assuming
I can assume first

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.980
that the atom has infinite mass.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.950
And once the atom
has infinite mass,

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:11.650
the motion degree of
freedom doesn't matter.

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:14.090
What I just explained to
you is a practical way

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.570
to endow your particle
with infinite mass.

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:21.690
Just connect it with type
confinement to your apparatus.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.160
And then for the
momentum exchange,

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.860
there is a photon
field, it is actually

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.550
the mass of the whole
apparatus [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:31.240
Questions?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.039
AUDIENCE: Is there
a more direct way

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:36.641
to think about this for maybe
the example of a magnetic trap,

01:03:36.641 --> 01:03:43.024
the mechanism by which this
momentum is transferred?

01:03:43.024 --> 01:03:45.479
Or absorbed.

01:03:45.479 --> 01:03:46.590
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.530
Magnetic traps for
neutral particles

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:49.660
are usually not in
the Lamb-Dicke regime,

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.285
so you have to be a
little bit careful.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.790
But the explanation
would be the same.

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:05.840
The magnetic fields
are like tight springs

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.050
which connect the neutral
atom to your coins.

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.810
And therefore, you
should just think

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:16.430
about the magnetic trap
in a mechanical model.

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:19.430
Your neutral atom is connected
to your coils with strings.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:24.670
And if you now hit the
atom with a photon,

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:28.200
because of the quantization
of the discreteness

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.540
of this specturm, the
photon, in most cases,

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.240
does not have enough
recoil to create

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.445
a mechanical oscillation
of your particle.

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:41.010
The momentum goes
through the sphinx

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.660
to the support structure.

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.870
But occasionally,
with a probability

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.410
which is a modulation
index squared,

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.910
you will actually
promote the particle

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:53.410
to the first state
of harmonic motion.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.680
And then the atom has
acquired some kinetic energy.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.830
But this probability
can be made as small

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:01.266
as you want by going to a
smaller and smaller modulation

01:05:01.266 --> 01:05:03.790
index.

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.574
That's the way how I
would think about it.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.215
Nancy?

01:05:09.215 --> 01:05:11.690
AUDIENCE: About
the multiple lines

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:17.135
that we get, I was wondering
if the levels of the harmonic

01:05:17.135 --> 01:05:21.590
traps itself are blurred,
which could happen in the lab

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:26.045
if the trap depth is
moving, for example--

01:05:26.045 --> 01:05:28.025
the levels of the trap
would get blurred.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:30.500
Would that result in
additional broadening of this?

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.480
Or how would that affect?

01:05:38.915 --> 01:05:40.290
PROFESSOR: It depends.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:44.420
I think if you have some
temporal broadening, you know,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.200
you just plug it into
your correlation function,

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.690
whatever shakes your system.

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.235
If that means the
atom sees some shaking

01:05:52.235 --> 01:05:54.812
in the phase of the
electromagnetic field,

01:05:54.812 --> 01:05:58.040
it affects it.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.980
If you have an ensemble of atoms
or if you do the experiment

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.500
repeatedly, and your
measurements are the ensemble,

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.940
and every time you
do the measurement,

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.426
your magnetic trap has a
slightly different [INAUDIBLE],

01:06:09.426 --> 01:06:12.540
and therefore, a slightly
different confinement, well,

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.686
what you would see is that
those sidebands fluctuate,

01:06:15.686 --> 01:06:19.462
that the carrier is independent
of the trap frequency.

01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:22.430
So therefore, the carrier is
actually the central peak--

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.150
would not be broadened
by fluctuations

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.430
in the harmonic confinement.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.240
Let me just make one comment.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.330
I derived the result for
you-- at least that one--

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:44.080
by taking the amplitude of the
atomic motion, the amplitude

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.940
of the phase, and doing
the Fourier analysis.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.990
I mean, this is
exactly what we learned

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:53.260
from the formalism of
correlation function.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.620
You should take the amplitude
of the perturbing field

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.940
and fully analyze it.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.150
I didn't phrase it
here in the language

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:00.220
of correlation functions.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.248
But what I did was exactly what
we learned from the correlation

01:07:04.248 --> 01:07:05.246
function formalism.

01:07:14.727 --> 01:07:15.230
OK.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.110
Let me maybe summarize
in words what we learned.

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:21.500
So what we learned
from this discussion

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.980
is that what matters for
line broadening and obtaining

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.130
spectroscopic information
is the accumulated phase,

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:32.715
the phase which the
atom accumulates.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.250
And if different
atoms in the ensemble

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:40.330
accumulate a phase which
is different by 2 pi,

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:43.060
at that moment, we
have reached what

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.450
we call the coherence time
of the correlation function.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:51.270
And the inverse of this
time is a line broadening.

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:54.850
But now we also discussed the
case of tight confinement.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.320
The atom can be in
very, very rapid motion.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.760
And the phi dot,
the change of phase

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.810
can be very rapid due to
the instantaneous velocity.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.520
But if the atom turns
around because it's

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.060
in a singulatory motion,
positive and negative Doppler

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.105
shifts completely
cancel, because you never

01:08:15.105 --> 01:08:20.420
allow the atom, in this periodic
motion, to acquire a net phase.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:26.510
And therefore, the motional
broadening is absent.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:28.950
So one way to think
about this carrier

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:32.765
is that the atom rapidly
oscillates through plus kv

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:35.240
and minus kv Doppler shifts.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.140
And the two cancel.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.248
So this is the reason for that.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:50.630
OK.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.898
I think we are now very well
prepared for Dicke narrowing.

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:12.710
Actually, I have to say, it's
the first class this semester

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.620
that I was teaching a little
bit faster than I assumed.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.750
So I'm now right at the end
what I prepared for today.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.770
But I know my notes
sufficiently well

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:24.380
that I can go on for 10 minutes.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.640
So the Dicke narrowing--
the last time I looked at it

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.859
was two years ago.

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:32.750
But let's get the
physical picture.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:38.500
So I want to now apply
what we have learned

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:43.189
not to a trapped atom,
but to an atom which

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:45.240
is embedded in buffer gas.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.790
So just think one
rubidium, or one sodium,

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:50.600
or one lithium atom.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.710
And it is surrounded by a
buffer gas of argon or neon.

01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:00.000
And I know sometimes when we
do saturation spectroscopy

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.340
to stabilize our lasers, we
have a little glass cell, which

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.450
has sodium or rubidium in it.

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:08.336
But we also put an argon
buffer gas into it.

01:10:08.336 --> 01:10:10.550
So that's the situation
I want to describe now.

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:12.520
But Colin, you had a question.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.246
You wrote down the condition
for resolving the sidebands

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:23.394
as your trapped frequency being
larger than your natural line

01:10:23.394 --> 01:10:24.640
width.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.890
An alkalizer-- if you had,
say it were 10 megahertz line

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.390
width.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:32.756
How do you actually resolve
this without a ridiculously--

01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:35.732
because people do
sideband [INAUDIBLE],

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:39.204
and they don't have 10 megahertz
trap frequencies, do they?

01:10:39.204 --> 01:10:40.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.460
So good question.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.640
The question is, the
resolved sideband

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.924
limit, how can we reach it?

01:10:47.924 --> 01:10:49.610
Well, it can be
reached in ion traps.

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:53.910
In ion traps, because you can
put kilovolts on electrodes,

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:56.165
you can really create harmonic
oscillator frequencies

01:10:56.165 --> 01:10:58.190
which are many, many megahertz.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.350
And then you are at the
resolved sideband limit,

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.164
assuming that the natural
lifetime, if that's the case,

01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:05.912
of many ions is in the
megahertz [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:05.912 --> 01:11:08.036
For neutral atoms,
it looks like, you

01:11:08.036 --> 01:11:11.240
know, mission impossible.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.990
However, there's a way out,
and this is the following.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:18.330
One is you can maybe [INAUDIBLE]
one-dimensional optical latice.

01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.700
So in the latices, you at
least have tight confinement

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.390
of many, many kilohertz.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:28.260
But now you want to use
a very narrow transition.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.070
If you use a very,
very narrow transition,

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:35.910
then even for 10 kilohertz
external harmonic oscillator

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:40.240
potential, [INAUDIBLE]
resolved sideband [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.310
Now, for alkalis, you
won't find an excited state

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:47.035
which has a natural line
width of 10 kilohertz.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.020
And this will be our
discussion on Wednesday.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.757
If you use a Raman
transition, we

01:11:56.757 --> 01:11:59.980
go from one count state
with an off-resonant laser

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.640
to another ground
state, [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.740
will be two photon transitions.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.980
But those two photons, since
there's no intermediate state,

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.287
can be regarded as, click-click,
you absorb two photons.

01:12:11.287 --> 01:12:12.870
And in some picture--
that's a message

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.810
I will give you next week-- the
equivalent to a single photon.

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:20.190
So now you have a
two-photon transition,

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.230
which transfers
recall to the atom.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:25.792
So the effective wavelengths
of the two-photon transition

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:29.175
is because you have
twice the photon energy.

01:12:29.175 --> 01:12:31.680
You have two photons involved
which both have a recoil.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.440
So the effective k vector is two
times the k vector of an atom.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.070
But the spontaneous line
width is close to 0,

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:42.420
literally 0, because you
have a Raman transition

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.260
between two common states.

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.130
If you do Raman sideband
cooling of neutral atoms,

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.790
then you reach the
Lamb-Dicke limit,

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:55.600
you reach the limit
of strong confinement.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.535
But you need a better
[INAUDIBLE] transition.

01:12:57.535 --> 01:12:59.562
And there are, of
course, some atoms

01:12:59.562 --> 01:13:01.540
which have a very
narrow clock transition.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.660
But for many, many atoms which
have hyperfine structure,

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.749
you can resolve to
Raman transition.

01:13:10.751 --> 01:13:11.250
OK.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.104
Let's now talk about
Dicke narrowing.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.640
So we have a situation that
we have an atom in buffer gas.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.579
And in most situations, when
you put an atom into buffer gas,

01:13:33.579 --> 01:13:35.495
you get what is called
collisional broadening.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.500
I will talk about collisional
broadening on Friday.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.780
Just a reminder, we have
class on Friday but not

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:44.831
on the following Monday.

01:13:44.831 --> 01:13:47.080
So on Friday, we'll talk
about collisional broadening.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.406
And I will discuss, for
instance, the model-- an atom

01:13:49.406 --> 01:13:53.624
in the excited state, when it
collides, it gets de-excited.

01:13:53.624 --> 01:13:55.332
And then you have
pretty much a situation

01:13:55.332 --> 01:14:00.150
where you have, in effect,
a shortened lifetime

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:01.659
of the excited state.

01:14:01.659 --> 01:14:03.200
And what you get is
a Lorentian which

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.766
is broader, which has a width
not of the natural line width,

01:14:07.766 --> 01:14:10.310
but a width which
is [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:12.510
But there are
situations-- and that's

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:15.060
what I want to discuss
here-- that we have

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.630
atoms in a more
benign buffer gas.

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:30.010
Where we can assume that
this is actually fulfilled,

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:33.635
that collisions do not change.

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:40.390
Well, they're not de-exciting
the excited state.

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:42.905
But they're not even
changing the coherence

01:14:42.905 --> 01:14:45.280
between counter-excited state.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.720
So the phase evolution,
the internal state,

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.174
grounded excited
state just-- if you

01:14:51.174 --> 01:14:53.340
can assume you have a Bloch
vector which oscillates,

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.940
and the Bloch vector
superposition [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.350
excited state oscillates
at the natural frequency,

01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.600
and this Bloch
vector just rotates,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.855
it doesn't have a hiccup,
it doesn't change its phase

01:15:02.855 --> 01:15:05.860
when the atom collides
with the buffer gas atom.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.020
So we assume that we have such
a buffer gas where collisions

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.600
don't change the
internal coherence.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:23.420
And by internal coherence,
I mean the phase

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:31.370
between the ground state
and the excited state.

01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:33.700
So in this situation--
but it's actually

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.320
a very important situation
which has been reached,

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.390
in many cases.

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:41.060
In this situation,
we have-- thus,

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:48.100
the buffer gas acts only on the
external motion of the atom.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.950
And now you can
say, in some way,

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:54.360
the buffer gas acts like a trap.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.277
The particle wants
to fly away, but it

01:15:56.277 --> 01:15:58.160
collides with the
buffer gas atom.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.840
And with a certain probability
or after a few collisions,

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.768
it returns back to the origin.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.475
However, it's a lousy
trap, because there

01:16:15.475 --> 01:16:17.920
is some randomness
and effusive motion.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.850
So if you want to
describe it as a trap,

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:25.906
it would be a trap with a wide
spread of trap frequencies.

01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:41.700
OK.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.710
So if we use this
picture now, what

01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:52.355
we have learned from
ion traps-- remember,

01:16:52.355 --> 01:16:55.220
we had an ion trap
with a sharp carrier.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:00.150
And then we had sidebands
at the trap frequency.

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:04.350
But if we have sort of
now a lousy trap which

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.745
each realization, each
moment has a different trap

01:17:06.745 --> 01:17:08.760
frequency when
waving all my arms,

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.740
I would say for the other
part of the ensemble,

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.620
we get a carrier, and
we have something else.

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:19.160
And for another realization,
we have another trap frequency.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.000
So if I use a little bit
of artistic intuition here,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.310
I would expect, based
on what we learned

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:32.896
from the previous discussion,
that in such a buffer gas,

01:17:32.896 --> 01:17:37.490
I would have a sharp
carrier, and then I

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:40.170
would have sort of
a pedestal, which

01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:43.740
is the envelope of
many trap frequencies.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:48.440
And we know sort of that the
envelope of all our sticks--

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.150
this was actually given
by the Doppler effect.

01:17:53.150 --> 01:18:00.865
So what we may expect now
is that in this situation

01:18:00.865 --> 01:18:04.330
with buffer gas, we
get a sharp line.

01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:07.260
And then we have
this broad pedestal,

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.860
which you can think
[INAUDIBLE] intuitive picture

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.720
as smeared outside bands.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.890
And I may call that
the Doppler pedestal.

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:22.385
And we would expect--
and I discussed that

01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:23.935
with the basal
function, that there

01:18:23.935 --> 01:18:27.330
is one limit where the
envelope of all those sticks

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:30.855
eventually looks like a
Doppler-broadened line.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.200
Anyway, time is over.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.290
But let me just give an outlook.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:46.206
On Friday, what
I want to do is I

01:18:46.206 --> 01:18:48.820
want to calculate the width
of this line with you.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.510
And remember, all
we have to do is

01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:55.450
we have to calculate the
correlation function.

01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:59.510
Previously, when I derived
for you Doppler broadening,

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:05.620
the correlation function
was the kx becoming kvt.

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.710
kvt, where x became vt
how much the atom moves

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:11.500
with the velocity v.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:15.960
By simply replacing the
linear motion, V times t,

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.150
with a diffusive model, we
can calculate the line shape.

01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:25.670
And we will actually find
that the central line is not

01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.550
infinitely sharp,
but it has a width

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:30.760
which is given by the
diffusion constant.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.950
And if the diffusion
constant is very, very small,

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:34.838
we approach a very sharp line.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:42.550
And the final comment is, and
this is called Dicke narrowing.

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:45.120
It is this
counterintuitive result

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.190
that collisions, if they
have those properties,

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:50.890
are not broadening the line.

01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:54.650
They actually narrow the line
from the [INAUDIBLE] Doppler

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:56.790
width to something
which is much sharper.

01:19:56.790 --> 01:20:01.590
And this has been useful for
high precision spectroscopy.

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:04.065
But I think with the concept
which we discussed today

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:09.910
of confinement, you realize
why collisions can actually

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:12.940
reduce the line widths,
namely by preventing

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:17.924
the atoms from acquiring
random phases with respect

01:20:17.924 --> 01:20:20.620
to the drive field [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.260
Any questions?

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.960
So see you on Friday
in this other building,

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.760
this other lecture
hall that's just

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.210
been announced on the website.

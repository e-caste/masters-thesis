00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.210
PROFESSOR STRANG: So I'm
ready for anything, hope I am.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.030
Questions about any topic.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.530
Yes.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.816
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:31.190
PROFESSOR STRANG: I feel this
is like a White House press

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.730
conference.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.760
I think there's always
somebody in the front row who

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.610
gets to ask the first
question, and then

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.350
gets to say thank you
Mr. President at the end,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.450
and then I'm off.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.800
Yes.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.100
I'm tempted by the
way to ask you all,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.060
are you going to
vote next Tuesday

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.780
and of course I'd like
to know who you vote for,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.130
and I'd like to
give you my advice.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.050
But I don't know
that that's proper.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.510
If anybody wants
advice, they can email.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.460
But please vote.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.320
Please vote.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.380
Yeah.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.900
Alright, question here and
then we'll have, well, yeah.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.660
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, OK,
so those were just posted.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.930
Like, I see.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
3.3 number two.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.130
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so this
was a case -- yeah, right.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.640
Oh, OK.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.690
We could be wrong so
this is 3.3 number two,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.970
asks you about the flow field.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.540
Which has no flow
in the x direction,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.530
the velocity in the
x direction is zero.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.660
The velocity in the
y direction is x.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.210
OK, so suppose we just
take that as a full field

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.820
and try to understand,
is it a gradient?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.260
I mean, so what are the
questions I would ask?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.940
Is it a gradient of anything?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.290
Because we're now thinking v and
w are pretty much the same guy.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.060
So is it a gradient, yes or no?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.110
If so, what's the potential?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.160
Is it divergence-free,
yes or no?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.810
If it is, what's
the stream function?

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.510
And of course if the answer
to both tests was yes, then

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
we would be talking
about Laplace's equation.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.600
I suspect for this
example the answer,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.480
at least to one of the
two questions, will be no.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.160
So we won't have the two pieces
coming together into Laplace.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.820
OK, so first of all.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.860
Is it a gradient?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.300
What's the test for, so
my two questions are,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.160
is v the gradient of some u?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.560
And what's the test for that?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.930
You remember if it
is a gradient --

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.860
and see if I can
remember myself.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.130
If it is a gradient, then this
is du/dx, and this is du/dy,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.050
and the condition that v_1
and v_2 would have to satisfy

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.090
is that the y
derivative of that would

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.820
have to equal the x
derivative of that,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.840
because on the right-hand
side they are the same.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.550
u_xy is the same as u_yx.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.300
So I would look at -- so
let me write that again.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:04.620
I need dv_1/dy to equal dv_2/dx,
and is that true in this

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.690
example?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.780
What's dv_1/dy?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.546
Zero.

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:11.170
What's dv_2/dx?

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.600
One.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.960
So the answer's no.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.360
OK.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.870
So, test failed.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.480
Alright, the second question
is does it possibly sit over

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.680
in the divergence-free world?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.310
Is the divergence of, now
I'll call it w. equal zero?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.420
So the answer was
no to that question

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.720
but now I think the answer
to this question will be yes.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.550
Because what's the
divergence of this thing?

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.020
It's the x derivative of
that, which is certainly

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.780
zero, plus the y derivative of
that, which is certainly zero.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.260
So the answer is yes.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.290
So there's no potential but
there is a stream function,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.980
right?

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.200
Because the stream function
comes in with this test.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.390
So let's remember what, just
from today's lecture, what

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.980
was the stream function?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:26.550
From dw_1/dx+dw_2/dy=0, that'll
be satisfied if w_1 is the y

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.160
derivative of the
stream function,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.220
and w_2 is minus
the x derivative.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.730
Because then this matches
the x derivative of this

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.980
plus the y derivative of
this, which is the divergence;

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.980
on the right-hand
side I would get zero.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.040
So there's got to be
an s, and what is it?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.150
Probably not hard to find.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.930
Let's see.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.540
Here w_1 is zero,
so that tells me

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.600
s doesn't depend
on y at all. w_2

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.860
is x, so x is supposed to
be minus the x derivative

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.930
of the stream function, so what
is the stream function now?

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.330
Have I got room to put it here?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.820
Just about.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.440
What will work?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.060
So again, here's w_1.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.420
The y derivative of s
is zero. w_2 tells me

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.710
that the x derivative
of s is minus x.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.660
So all I'm looking for is a
function that only depends

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.520
on x, has no dependence
on y, and its derivative

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.530
should be minus x.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.260
So what's the function?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.070
Minus a half of x squared.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:54.430
Yeah, so this gives me s equal
minus a half of x squared.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.830
Alright, so you're
saying that, so there

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.560
is a stream function, right.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.780
And what does that travel along?

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.110
That travels along steam, that
means that the flow buzzes

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.800
along streamlines.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.650
And what are the streamlines?

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.220
They're the lines
where s is constant.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.100
Equipotentials were the
lines where u is constant,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.050
but here we don't have
a u in this problem.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.300
Streamlines are lines
where the s is constant,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.030
so minus 1/2 x
squared is constant,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.270
what's the picture look like?

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.910
Picture then, for
that, well, and you

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:42.600
know what the flow is doing
at a typical point here.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.390
Say x=3, y=1.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.630
Let me draw the little arrow.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.150
With a big chalk Which
way is the flow going?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.940
Well, the x component is
zero, the y component is x.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.730
So the flow is going
up there, right?

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.270
Here the y component's x.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:16.330
This whole line is all traveling
up with the same velocity.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.770
If I drop a leaf there, it
buzzes up that straight line.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.570
So that's the streamline.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:27.940
And its velocity is,
that's x equal -- if, say,

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.590
the velocity is three
then this speed is three.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.440
It's going up that line.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.160
So that's a streamline.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.780
And sure enough, on that
line minus 1/2 x squared

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.950
is a constant.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.850
So you see we're not
talking parabolas

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:51.200
here because our curve is not
y equals minus 1/2 x squared,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.140
it's minus 1/2 x
squared equal constant.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.330
Yeah, that's what we want.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:02.630
So, but now having got so
far, let me take x=1, say.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.650
What's the flow like on that?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:11.340
So there's a streamline
with s equal constant.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.070
And the velocity
on that is zero,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.750
so nothing is going in
that -- horizontally.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:25.120
And now it's one, so the
flow is slower up this line.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.640
OK, slower flow.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.140
This was faster flow.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.610
And then the question that's
in that homework problem is,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.570
is there any rotation
in this flow?

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:45.300
We think about rotation, we have
an image of rotational flow.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.370
And that could be the next
example, we could figure out.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.660
A flow that goes around
in circles, right?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.440
Those would be the streamlines.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.830
So this would be like pure
rotation, shall I call it.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.330
But I don't have that there.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.580
I just want to draw the
other picture, in which

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:16.410
the streamlines are circles.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.790
To have another nice,
clean, beautiful example.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.910
OK, but here we don't have.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.070
Our streamlines
are straight lines,

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.910
and yet we have rotation.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.490
That's the point here.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.180
Why do I say we have rotation?

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.530
Because the test for rotation
was that original test

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:43.710
of looking at, which I just
wrote the answer to be no here.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.120
So if it's not a
gradient, the reason

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.530
is there's some rotation.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.230
Gradient fields don't
have any rotation.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:59.680
The rotation is this
thing that comes out,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.000
yeah it's this
difference. dv_2/dx,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.720
it's the difference
between those that tells us

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.190
the rotation.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.260
And that was not zero, right?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:18.600
For this example dv_1/dy was
zero, because v_1 is zero.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.670
dv_2/dx was one,
because v_2 is x.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.590
So there's some rotation here.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.100
And in other words the
test for being a gradient

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.800
is no rotation.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.720
This fails that test.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.260
But how is it rotating?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.000
How can it be rotating when
the all the flow is just

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.530
traveling vertically?

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.150
I guess I give you this example
because it meant something

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.820
to me.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.350
My image of rotation was this
simpleminded type of flow.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.940
You know, like a phonograph
record or something.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.160
This would be
called a sheer flow.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.950
A very important type of flow.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.540
And actually, you'll realize
that if x is negative

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.480
then the flow in the second
component, the velocity,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.470
is now negative.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.300
So it would be the
streamline, the flow

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.820
would be going down this way.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.420
And this point
wouldn't move at all.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.670
This would be, well I don't
know if it's a streamline,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:30.200
it's a stagnant
streamline, right? x=0.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.510
On that line, there's
no velocity. [0, 0].

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.000
So this is all
just staying there.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
These lines are moving,
this line moving faster,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.950
this line would be
moving even faster.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.920
This line's going the other way.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.650
Faster and faster the other way.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.190
It's a important flow.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.650
You know, in earthquakes
and things like that.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:57.920
This happens, when one plate
shears with respect to another.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.210
So that's shearing.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:05.940
The word shearing means
that a line that was --

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.810
that line after a
while is tilted.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.050
This is going faster than this.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.710
Yes.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.530
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Right, being a constant.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
That's true.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.370
Ah, well, OK.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.290
Let's see.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.590
Well, how do I fix that?

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.810
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.870
That's a good question.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:48.680
Should I have allowed
in my stream function,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.320
I mean that's a stream function.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.730
Because it satisfies the
equations that stream functions

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.580
are -- I could have thrown
in a constant, yeah.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.910
So your pointing
out a difficulty

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.880
makes me think I should
have thrown in a constant.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.510
So if I throw in constants then
I could get other lines, yeah.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.630
Thanks, that's a good point.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.600
I just want to see, do you
see rotation in this flow,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.380
in this shear flow?

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.600
And I think you do.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.840
If you think about it.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.680
Suppose you put a little leaf,
or a little penny or something

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.920
right there.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.150
OK, is it going to turn?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.880
It'll flow along, but as it
flows, is it going to turn?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:40.410
In other words, is there some
difference in the speed on one

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.550
side compared to the other?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.280
I mean, it's what makes
a curveball curve, right?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.140
When the pitcher throws the
ball, he imparts a spin to it,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.090
and that gives a
different pressure

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.630
on the two sides of the
ball, and the ball moves.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.330
I think that's going
to happen here.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.540
Maybe you see it,
and I'm just talking.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.220
I mean, this side is going
faster than this side.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.180
So the net result is that even
though the thing is traveling

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.440
up and down, it's turning.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.550
It's turning because the
right-hand side is going faster

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.910
than the left-hand side.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.750
So it does have a rotation.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:28.290
This quantity, this difference
between dv_1/dy and dv_2/dx,

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.510
which is the
component of the curl,

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.700
maybe the sign should
be the opposite,

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.650
maybe I think it should be minus
this plus this or something.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.990
Point is that it's not zero.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.800
So there is curl,
there is rotation.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.830
OK.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.600
I was going to ask
about this picture, too.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.870
And then I'll open
to more examples.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.600
I just feel examples are good.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.430
Simple velocity fields, like 0x.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.440
Just to think through,
OK, what does that mean?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.310
Is it curl free?

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.650
Another way of saying is it a
gradient field would be to say

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.900
is it curl free?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.260
Irrotational is the
right word here.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.960
Test one, is it
irrotational, answer no.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.320
Is it divergence-free,
is it source-free,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.690
the answer was yes,
for this example.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.830
If we pick another example
I could reverse those,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.810
or another example -- I
can probably come up with

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.590
an example here.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:39.160
Let's see, what if I wanted
the streamlines to be circles,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:46.110
what would be a good velocity
field that goes in circles?

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.020
Let's see.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.120
At a typical point, if I want
the velocity to be going that

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:58.030
way, here's the vector,
the position vector,

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.260
the radial vector that goes
-- so what are the components

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.880
of this vector?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.890
Just [x, y].

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:12.300
So now if I want the velocity
field to go other way,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.560
what would be a good
thing with rotation?

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.640
[-y, x] would sound good.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.460
v=[-y, x].

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.390
So are we expecting this to
be a gradient of anything?

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.730
I'm not.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.380
We've built in rotation here.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.940
I'm expecting the curl of
this thing, this quantity,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.720
I think I take the
x derivative --

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.805
I look at the y derivative of
this and compare it with the x

00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:49.910
derivative of that.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.450
And they're not the same;
in fact one is minus one

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.070
and the other's plus one.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.420
So I've got rotation here.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:03.340
I've got sort of two, is
the component of the curl.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:09.180
So let's just write
it down. dv_2/dx,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:16.210
this vorticity that measures
the turning speed is one from

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.620
dv_2/dx, minus one is two.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.940
So it's not a
gradient of anything.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.180
If the x derivative
of u is minus y,

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.890
then the y derivative
can't be plus x, no good.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.580
OK, what about, is
it divergence-free?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.350
Do I need a source to
keep this flow going?

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.700
Well, what's the test?

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.650
In other words, is there a
stream function for this guy?

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.320
I think probably there is.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.900
What's the test to know if
there is a stream function?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.100
I take the divergence, I'm
over on the right-hand side

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.260
of my picture now.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.170
I take the divergence.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:07.130
Divergence of this v is
the x derivative of that

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.280
plus the y derivative
of that, good, zero.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.440
So there is a stream function.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.620
And what is it?

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.740
Well, I'm pretty sure that
these streamlines are circles,

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.525
I think the stream
function is going

00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:27.670
to be x squared plus y squared.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.920
Yep.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:38.420
Then, am I right that the y
derivative of that will be 2y.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.990
That's not looking too good.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.590
What do I want here?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.520
Here's my v, which
is the same as w.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.630
And what I'm looking for is
to get these guys correct.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.330
So -- and I should
be able to do it.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.230
And what would s be?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.410
I haven't got s quite right.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.760
I think if I multiply
by negative 1/2,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.490
that might have done it.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:13.860
Yeah, because now the y
derivative is now minus y.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.050
Great.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:20.410
And the x derivative
of s is minus x,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.800
and then I should take
a minus that, so I

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.890
should want a plus x,
which is what I've got.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.950
So those are the streamlines.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.380
Circles.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.530
So I have circle, the flow
is going around in a circle.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.550
I don't have to -- I don't need
any source to keep it going.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:48.400
But it's not a gradient.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:57.760
So this is like a sample test,
to take a simple flow field,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.340
apply the two tests,
and I guess we

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.310
should complete with an
example that passes both tests.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.500
Right?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.740
Let me open to any
other question,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.460
and then we could cook
up an example that passes

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.380
both tests before we stop.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.850
I'll stop talking first, though.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.360
Just listen for a
question on any topic.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.100
Or is it useful just to
take fields like this

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.620
and go through those steps?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.610
It probably is.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.020
It's certainly good for me.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.290
OK, what's a field that
will satisfy everybody,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.710
that will be a
gradient field and also

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.030
divergence-free, so that
we'll have solutions

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.460
to Laplace's equation.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.610
Let's see.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:59.040
Well we had some solutions
to Laplace's equation there.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.880
You know if I make it
linear it's real easy.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:11.450
If I make it quadratic -- huh.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.740
Can I anticipate a little
what's coming Friday?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.720
I so recommend to come to
Friday's lecture, but --

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.750
so what's coming?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.310
What did we do today?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.760
We discovered that we got
solutions to Laplace's equation

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.440
from all, by real and imaginary
parts of all these guys.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.510
Those were terrific.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.180
And then we could take
combinations of those.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.610
So here's what's coming Friday.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:46.800
When I take combinations of
these guys I get some function

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:54.030
of this magic complex -- of
this magic combination x+iy.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.940
Some function, any function.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.850
Any reasonable function, and
we'll say what reasonable

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.820
means, of x+iy, its real part
and its imaginary part are

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.330
going to be great.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.460
This is like the center of a
big, big part of mathematics.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.660
Functions of x+iy.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.030
And by nice I mean that
these series converge.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.240
So that we have really
a nice function.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.780
Let me take the first function
that comes to mind. e^(x+iy).

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.850
So let me take this
to be e^(x+iy).

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.571
OK.

00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:38.070
Right.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.590
So you remember, I'm
aiming to get solutions

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.930
to Laplace's equation, because
that will give me automatically

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.220
the two pieces both working.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.870
So I claim that the real part
of that, and the imaginary part,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.860
those are my twins, u
and s, both solve --

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.200
so u is going to be the
real part of this function.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.740
And s is going to be the
imaginary part of it.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.360
And I claim that those will
both solve Laplace's equation.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.150
We can plug it in
and see that it does.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:13.320
And that they will
have, they're twinned

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.820
by the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.950
So how am I going
to simplify that,

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.710
so that I can identify what's
the real part of that thing

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.170
and what's the imaginary part?

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.950
This is actually,
that's a good question.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.960
I don't know how much you've
run into i, in the past.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.350
Are you happy with
something like that?

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.360
How could you find
the real part of it,

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.540
how could you simplify it?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:51.820
How else could I write
e to the something?

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.830
Exactly.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.880
Think of it as the
product of two,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.790
so the key fact about
exponentials is that

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.650
that's the same as
e^x times e^(iy).

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.260
The exponents add, so that's
the first thing always

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.280
to think about as a possibility.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.950
Now, what am I going to do?

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.770
I still want to get a real part.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.330
This is clearly all
real, right? e^x is real.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.960
So it's this part that's going
to give me the two pieces.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.310
So this is going to
be e^x times -- now,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.850
what do I put for e^(iy)?

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.820
cos(y), good.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.820
Plus i*sin(y), good.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.090
And now I can read
off, no problem.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:43.990
What is this real part that I
was looking for? e^x*cos(y).

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.787
And the imaginary part is
just what's multiplying the i,

00:25:52.787 --> 00:25:53.620
it's the e^x*sin(y).

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.080
OK, so what's my claim?

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.990
I claim that that function
solves Laplace's equation.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.330
And this one too.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.310
And that they're twinned.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.890
And that they give
streamlines and equipotentials

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:22.670
that meet at right
angles, it's another pair.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.290
Plug that into
Laplace's equation.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:33.835
So let me do u_xx+u_yy, just
to satisfy that it is going

00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:35.710
to come out zero.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.380
So what's the xx derivative,
the second x derivative

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.880
of that function?

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.620
Take its derivative with respect
to x, and then do it again,

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.480
and what do you have?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.010
Same.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:55.330
Didn't change. e^x is just --
and now what about the second y

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.060
derivative?

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.350
So now e^x is just a constant.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.330
What's the second
derivative of cos(y)?

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.080
Negative cos(y).

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.580
Right.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.870
Because the first
derivative is negative sine,

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.160
the second derivative
is negative cosine.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.300
So the second derivative
is e^x, it didn't change,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.440
times cos(y) with a minus sine.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.390
And you see what --
did I write sine?

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.710
I meant to write cosine.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.430
Cancel that from the tape.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.171
OK, right.

00:27:29.171 --> 00:27:29.670
Yeah.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.065
So the second x derivative
was just e^x, e^x,

00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:34.900
cos(y) didn't move.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.770
Sorry.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.100
That was frightening.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.850
OK, and then now here's
the second y derivative.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:44.630
In other words, it gives zero.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.760
Gives zero, and
this one would too.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:28:01.380
Now, I don't really have an idea
of what the picture is like.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.890
But it's important.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:08.780
We've got a flow field here,
and it's from e^z, e^(x+iy).

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.010
Exponential has gotta be
an important function.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.040
So it's got to be
somehow interesting.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.140
What do you think --
so what would the --

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.610
what would the equipotential
lines looks like?

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.760
Oh, boy.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.210
e^x*cos(y) equal a constant.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.740
My gosh.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.350
e^x*cos(y).

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.240
So let's see.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.610
I don't know how to draw this
picture, but one thing I know

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:48.840
is that if I changed y by
2pi, I would get another copy

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.650
of this curve, right?

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.060
If I changed y by -- every
time you see cosine or sine,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.990
you think hey, that's periodic.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.730
If I change it by 2pi.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:10.510
So I'm thinking that y between
zero and 2 pi, so here's y=0.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:18.390
And y=2pi, I'm thinking that
my flow probably somehow stays

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.850
in a strip.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.970
Like that.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.780
And then the whole thing
just repeats, and repeats,

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.430
and repeats.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.260
So I'm thinking, really this
is flow in an infinite strip.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.510
Infinite pipe or
something like that.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.160
You can imagine that there
could be applications.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.040
But I still haven't
drawn the curve.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:46.080
I just think, let's see, what
would it look like when y is

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.300
a little -- suppose I'm
trying to draw the picture

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:55.380
of e^x*cos(y)=1, whatever.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.970
OK, I'll just attempt
to draw that curve.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:09.180
Just, so if y was a
little bit off of zero,

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:14.460
the cosine would be, yeah,
how's it going to go?

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:24.980
If y is just a little
off zero, tell me

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:30.080
any points on this curve?

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.560
I can see that e^x is
going to be a big number.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.400
Is (0,0) on the curve?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.140
Good.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:44.310
Got one point.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.320
Alright.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.120
Now, suppose y is a
little bit more than zero.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.190
So suppose y goes
up a little bit.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.920
Then what? (1,0) or something?

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.420
Yeah.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.530
I suppose (1,0)?

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.410
No, no.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:16.790
So if y goes up a little, then
x would go out a little bit.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.080
So what's happening?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:26.800
So cos(y), so the cos(y) is
going to drop from one to zero,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.680
right?

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.020
To start with.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.360
Then, if this cos(y) is dropping
from one to zero then this e^x

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:39.650
has got to climb up, to
to keep the product one.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:40.530
So I'll move out.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.390
So somehow it'll move out.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:59.230
I think maybe when
y reaches pi/2,

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:06.100
then the cosine has
got down to zero.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.270
We could work on
this for a while.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.440
Or we could let MATLAB draw it.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.590
But I think that we would see
these -- and I could do better.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:22.900
I'm feeling pretty humiliated to
not have a better picture here.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.190
Suppose y is a little
less than zero,

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.990
do we get anything
interesting there?

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.610
Oh well, the cosine
is an even function.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.740
So I think the thing
might, is it just

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.600
going to turn around like that?

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.450
So that y and minus
y -- for a certain x,

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.299
the y value and the minus
y will both be on the curve

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.590
because the cosine doesn't
know whether it's the cosine

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.170
of of a plus or a minus.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:58.250
Yeah, I think we would
get curves of that sort.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:04.210
And then the other
curves, s equal constant,

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.530
the streamlines will
somehow go vertically.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:14.090
Maybe I'll just not
use the whole time

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.300
to work on that
particular curve.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.220
We'd have to prepare it.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:25.690
The point is, you see how
incredibly easily we produce

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.450
solutions to Laplace's
equation that you

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.190
wouldn't have thought of, and
I wouldn't have thought of.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.340
So that would be one way
to produce solutions.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.410
I might even repeat this one in
class Friday, or I might not.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.090
Let me suggest another
couple of possibilities

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.690
that I will do in class.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.930
Can I just give you a
couple of other functions f.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:54.220
In fact, I'll just erase that
one and put in some other ones.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.980
Suppose I took the
function 1/(x+iy).

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.080
So that's a function of this
magic combination, x+iy.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.460
What's its real part and
what's its imaginary part?

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.470
Do you know how to split that
guy into real and imaginary?

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.380
There's a little
trick, if you remember

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.660
from learning complex numbers.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.500
Do you remember the trick?

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:32.130
The problem is that this thing
is down in the denominator,

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.070
right?

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.610
We don't want it there.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.570
Because we can't split the real
and imaginary parts down there.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.560
So I would like to
rewrite it in a way that

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.690
gets something real
down in the denominator,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.340
moves all the i stuff
up in the numerator

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.290
where I can separate it.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.830
How do I do it?

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:59.540
Multiply both sides by, both
top and bottom, by x-iy.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.310
Good.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.320
So what does that
put down here now?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.140
That's a number
times its conjugate

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.550
and that's going to
produce x squared.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.620
Minus or plus?

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.450
Plus y squared, right.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:19.860
The number times its conjugate
is the length squared.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:27.090
And now we just have x-iy, and
now it's obvious what the u is.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.490
This is real now,
so the u is just

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:35.550
x over x squared plus
y squared, and the s

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:41.930
is the minus y over x
squared plus y squared.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.760
That's a very interesting flow.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.070
That's an interesting
flow, and we

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.800
could do its picture and so on.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.980
And in fact it would
be a nicer picture

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.400
than the one we stopped on.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.170
What should I notice
about this flow?

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:08.760
Of course, the flow is
automatically irrotational;

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.860
the curl is zero because
there is a potential.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.560
A gradient of a potential,
the gradient of a potential

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.710
is going to be free of rotation.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:30.550
And there will be streamlines,
all those good things.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.090
There's one bad point
about the flow, though.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.180
Which is where?

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.450
At (0,0).

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.690
The whole thing falls apart,
at the origin this falls apart.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.240
So this is a great flow
except at the origin,

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.420
it's very problematic.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.080
It's singular at the origin.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:56.370
So if we drew the pictures we
would see something strange.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.530
This is going to
zero at the origin.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.800
So, yeah, we have trouble at
the origin but an important flow

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.450
otherwise, yep.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.170
And I'll just mention
the third but I

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.590
won't do anything with it.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.720
Because it's such
a neat one that I

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.540
have to save it for Friday.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.500
The other natural function
to think of is the logarithm.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.890
The logarithm of x+iy.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:28.870
Split that into u and s.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.320
What kind of a thing
do we have here?

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.760
What kind of singularity?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.080
Yeah, let me just do two
moments on this example,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.560
and then leave it for Friday
because the whole class has

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.090
to see it.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.530
Is there a singularity
for this guy?

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:56.300
Is there a point (x,y) where
the logarithm is not great?

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.460
At the origin, again.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.660
We'll again have a
singularity at the origin.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.260
Something strange is
happening at the origin.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.730
And what we'll find is there's
a delta function there.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:14.220
We're feeding in, we have a
source right at the origin

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:20.410
and then it's flowing out
on, I think on radial lines.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.600
I think the streamlines
go out from the origin

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.180
and the equipotentials
go around the origin.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.220
Yeah, it's a great example.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.200
So that's another one to come.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.290
OK, so examples
like these are --

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:41.820
I mean generations of
thinking went into solutions

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.380
of Laplace's equation.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:50.550
And 2-D particularly where we
have this special combination.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:55.210
I wish we had such a combination
in 3-D but we simply don't.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.780
We can discuss Laplace's
equation in 3-D of course,

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.590
very important.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.980
But I mean, wave equation, this
fact that we're talking to each

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:16.520
other, is got the Laplacian in
3-D, but there's no x+iy magic.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:21.170
OK, that's some u's and
s's and v's and w's.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:25.880
What else is on your mind?

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.420
Questions?

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.200
I could ask this question,
oh, here's something

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.910
I did not do in class.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.070
I think I wrote down
the divergence theorem.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.380
So can we start by doing that?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.350
Let me write down the divergence
theorem, with your help.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:55.270
And then use it.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.280
So what does the divergence
theorem -- we're in 2-D.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:03.230
So this is 2-D, just
the similar theorem.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:08.950
So what does the theorem say,
that if I take the divergence

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:19.710
of some w, some vector field,
then if I integrate that over

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:24.370
some region -- so I have some
region here and at every point

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.950
there's a flow w.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:33.700
And I look at the divergence of
w and I integrate that, dx dy,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.500
so that's a double
integral over a region,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:44.950
I will get, what's
the right-hand side?

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.040
What does the
divergence measure?

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.380
So I'm really asking like just
memory, what is the divergence,

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.740
it's an identity.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:00.990
It's integration by parts
in some way, as we'll see.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:06.470
But what do you remember
for the divergence theorem?

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.070
You get what?

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:14.020
It measures how much
flux out, right?

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.750
So when we measure the
flux out by integrating

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:21.700
around the boundary, how much
is getting through the boundary?

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.870
And what's the flow
through the boundary?

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.430
I take w, but that's a vector.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.340
And I'm looking for
what component of w?

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.230
The normal component, the
component of w, w dot n,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:42.040
the component of w that's
headed out. n is defined to be,

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.100
whatever the boundary is -- here
I've made it look like a circle

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.650
but I shouldn't have.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.730
Let me make it a little
wobblier or something.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:57.990
So the normal component at
any, there, look at that point.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:01.630
The normal direction
through the boundary,

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:05.390
down in that crazy
point, is this way.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.090
So the normal is
going this way here.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.100
Here, it's going over this way.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.680
It's perpendicular
to the boundary, OK?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.160
And then we integrate
around the boundary.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.880
Alright.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.440
So that's the identity of that,
that's the divergence theorem.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.280
Now, let's see.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.510
Could you, yeah.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:38.260
So we have a minute.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.990
You want to take a
particular w and see

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.770
if this would be correct?

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.710
How about w=w=[0, x],
our first example?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.830
Suppose I tried w=[0, x].

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.640
I just want to see
if the divergence --

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.980
what the flux is
through the boundary.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.130
What what region shall
I take for the --

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.470
so the divergence
theorem has two inputs.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.320
It has a flow field.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.580
And let me take w to be
[0, x], just so it's a shear.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.260
And a region.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.650
And of course the integral might
not be that much fun to do,

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.010
unless we make the region nice.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:29.900
What do you take as a nice
region for -- actually,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.320
it doesn't matter
what the region is.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.510
Take any old region.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.580
For the moment.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.570
What's the answer?

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.040
For this particular
flow, w=w=[0, x]?

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.550
Zero.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.570
That's the cool part.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.500
If the answer's zero
then work is suspended.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.840
And why is it zero?

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.620
Because the divergence
of this particular w,

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.550
the x derivative of that plus
the y derivative of that,

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.050
is zero.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:07.800
This has divergence
everywhere zero.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.740
So integrating is
no problem at all,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.000
so that would be zero,
for this flow field.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.290
For this divergence-free field.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:24.610
Zero for that because
div w is zero.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.290
But is that correct?

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.880
What does that tell
me, these flows are --

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.870
we saw what the flow is like.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.990
Say there's the origin.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:40.230
It doesn't have to be a
circle, it looks like a circle.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.700
Do you see why the flux is zero?

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.540
There is flow through
the boundary, right?

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:52.130
Flow is going buzz, buzz,
buzz up this line and out.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.920
And it's coming in here.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.740
So there that's
what we discovered.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:04.080
This [0, x] is vertical flow.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.750
It hasn't gotten any
horizontal component.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.320
It's got a vertical
component, it's going out.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.940
And would we want to do
this right-hand side?

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.670
I don't think so, right.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.370
This right-hand
side is asking me

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.960
what, I have to find the normal
direction on this, whatever

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.650
curve that is.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:28.020
I have to take its dot
product with the flow [0, x],

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:33.180
so this is some quantity.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.400
And then I have to do this ds
which I haven't even mentioned,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.350
ds is arc length around.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.680
I'm integrating
around these pieces.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:48.690
But yet somehow we have
some idea from that picture

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.670
that the total flux is zero.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:57.210
How would you say it in words,
if I say here's the flow field.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:01.690
There's a region, funny shape.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.880
The flux is zero
through that boundary.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.700
And if I asked you why,
what would you say?

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.690
I mean, a math answer would
be use the divergence theorem.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:19.300
But why from this picture does
it look like we have zero flux?

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.200
What comes in goes out, yeah.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.840
What's coming in the bottom
here is going out the top.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.620
That's basically it.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.620
So we would get
zero for that one.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.260
So I think the homework,
the suggested homework

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.430
maybe includes an example where
the divergence isn't zero.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.910
And then you actually have
to do these integrals.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:50.450
Just as practice for what
do those integrals mean.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:55.690
Maybe I won't go through one
now, but that's good practice.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:47:03.860
Take some simple w, but one
with a non-zero divergence

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.770
and then see if you
can do either or both

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:11.500
of the integrals that are
supposed to come out equal.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.970
That's a good one Now,
there's one thing I could --

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.990
any questions, or discussion?

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:25.090
You guys are seeing
these examples come up;

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.080
it's the only way I would know
to learn this subject is take

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.210
simple v's and w's.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:36.140
And see what you
can do with them.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.800
We've got the
general principles,

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:42.300
but then apply them
to specific flows.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes, thanks

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:51.729
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:51.729 --> 00:47:53.020
PROFESSOR STRANG: This theorem?

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:58.356
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:58.356 --> 00:47:59.730
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah if it was,

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:02.350
well let's draw a funny shape.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.680
See what we think.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:11.470
I mean, with this flow, right?

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:16.510
Let me just say, if the flow
has some difficult divergence

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.550
and the region is
some mess, nobody's

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:20.810
going to be able to do it.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:21.770
I mean, yeah.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.460
So don't think that
these can all be done.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.150
The equality, it's like
integrals in calculus.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.020
No problem to think
of integrations that

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.620
are just beyond human capacity.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.680
But the formulas still hold.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:43.510
Suppose my region
was even like this?

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:48.340
Would that still be, do we still
see flow in equals flow out

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.320
for this particular flow?

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.780
I think, yeah, the
flow's going this way.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.430
So it's coming in here,
it's going out again.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.790
That contributes.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.660
Back in again here,
and out again here.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:09.290
Yeah, I think our instinct
would be correct there, yeah.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.420
All sorts of examples.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:16.890
I was going to, well,
I'll maybe do it in class.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.750
This divergence theorem
is the fundamental theorem

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.920
of 2-D calculus, you could say.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.930
Or one of them.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:42.050
And to write these things and
see what they lead to, yeah.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.500
I'll tell you what
I was going to do.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:52.220
I was going to apply this to
the vector field u times w.

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:58.180
So u is a scalar, w is a vector,
and therefore uw is a vector.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:06.230
It's got two components, uw_1,
are you willing to do that one?

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:16.820
So I apply this not to w
itself, but to u times w.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:22.720
Which has two components,
uw_1 and uw_2.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.460
OK, so I should take
the divergence of uw.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:31.240
I mean, that's a vector
field, uw, this guy.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.420
And I'll get the uw dot n.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:41.700
And it just turns out that
this is the right way to do it.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.750
To see the fact that
gradient and divergence

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.070
are transposes of each other.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.060
I maybe I won't do
that calculation now,

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.790
I'll just say that if you take
the divergence theorem and you

00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:01.290
apply it to this
guy, [uw 1, uw 2],

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:10.190
and write out what it means, you
get a very interesting formula.

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.030
I'll just leave that there.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.570
So I'm ready for a final
question if there is one,

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:21.940
or otherwise keep going Friday
with these Laplace equation

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.210
solutions.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:25.780
Play with some vector fields.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.740
That's my best advice.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:34.090
And I'll see you Friday.

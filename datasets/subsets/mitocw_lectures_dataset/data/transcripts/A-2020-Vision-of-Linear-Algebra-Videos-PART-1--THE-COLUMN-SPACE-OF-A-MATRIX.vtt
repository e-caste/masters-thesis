00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.470
GILBERT STRANG: OK, here's
the, well, the title slide.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.750
Since this year
happened to be 2020,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.030
and that means clear
vision, I thought

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.430
I'd get that into the
title of these slides.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.880
And then you've seen in these
six pieces as a sort of look

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.490
ahead, and I'm going to start on
that first piece, A equals CR.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.200
That's the new way I like to
start teaching linear algebra.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.990
And I'll tell you why.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.640
OK, oh, here, we
have a few examples.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.340
Well, that will
lead to our ideas.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.870
You see that matrix, A0.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.480
A matrix is just a square
or a rectangle of numbers.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.920
But those numbers
have special features.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.110
If you look closely, well,
you say 1, 3, 2 as row 1.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.810
And then what do
you see for row 3?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.130
2, 6, 4.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.350
And those are two vectors
in the same direction.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.010
Why is that?

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.950
Because 2, 6, 4 is
exactly 2 times 1, 3, 2.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.080
And in the middle there
is 4 times 1, 3, 2.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.860
So I have three rows
in the same direction.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.410
And actually, also,
this is the magic.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.705
Can I tell you this
right at the start?

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:43.390
The columns, look
at the columns.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.950
1, 4, 2.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.280
If I multiply that
by 3, I get 3, 12, 6.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.790
If I multiply it by
2, I get 2, 8, 4.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.610
So somehow,
magically, the columns

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.790
are in the same direction
exactly when the rows

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.240
are in the same direction.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.040
They're different.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.140
That's what linear
algebra is about,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.580
the relations between
columns and rows.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.270
OK, and well, here's
another one I'll look at.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.800
There again, you see row
1 plus row 2 equal row 3.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
So it's not quite like
this where every row

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.730
was in the same direction.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.320
But here is if I add rows
1 and 2, I get row 2.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.830
So that's a matrix
of rank 2, we'll say.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.850
You'll see it.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.650
OK, then here here, S is
for symmetric matrices.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.450
Those are the kings
of linear algebra.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.870
And here are a
few small samples.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
And the queens of
linear algebra are

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.100
these matrices I call Q. Those
are called orthogonal matrices.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.570
Orthogonal meaning
perpendicular.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.090
So and they tend to
express a rotation.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.350
So that's a rotation matrix,
an orthogonal matrix.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.570
That rotates the plane.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.240
And there is a
pretty general matrix

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.995
that we'll see at the very end.

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:14.760
OK, so I'm into the start
of the column space.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.400
So that's a word I don't use in
the videos for quite a while.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.460
But here, you see I'm using
it in the first minutes.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.360
So I look at a matrix.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540
Well, first, let's
just remember how

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.440
to multiply a
matrix by a vector.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.570
OK, there is a matrix
A. There is a vector

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.580
x with three components.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.160
And the way I like
to multiply them

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.490
is to take the columns of A.
That's what I'm focusing on,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.210
columns of A. There
they are, 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.310
I multiply them by those three
numbers x1, x2, x3, and I add.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.280
And that's called a
linear combination.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.300
Linear because nothing is
squared or cubed or anything.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.840
And combination because
I'm putting them together,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.430
adding them together.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.800
OK, so that's the idea.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.480
And now, the big idea
is in that top line.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.280
I want to think of
all combinations.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.150
So this is one
particular combination

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.760
with a particular
x1 and x2 and x3.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.610
But now, I think of
every x1 and x2 and x3,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.160
all the vectors
that I could get.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.890
Well, of course, I could
get the first column

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.410
by taking 1 and 0 and 0.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.120
That would give me
the first column.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.530
But it's really mixtures of
the columns that this produces.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.690
And it fills out.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.840
It fills out, in this
case, a whole plane

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.340
in three dimensions.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.160
These vectors have
three components.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.910
We're in three dimensions.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.480
And can you just
imagine in your head,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.610
two lines meeting at 0, 0, 0.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.680
So they cross.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.180
But I just have two lines.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.100
And now, I fill in
between those lines.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.680
Filling in between
those two lines

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.430
is taking the
linear combinations.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.820
That's where they are.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.270
And the result is I get a plane.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.580
I do not get the whole
space because nothing

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.720
is going in a third
direction for this matrix.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.860
All right.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.230
So let's see more about this.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.960
So that's that
word column space.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.690
And I use the
capital C for that.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.300
And it's all the
vectors I can get

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.610
that way, all the
combinations of the columns.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.650
And now I ask.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.350
Oh, well, maybe I just
answered this question.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.400
Sorry.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.780
I ask, is the column space,
all the combinations,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.700
is it the whole 3D space, which
everybody calls R3 for real 3,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.700
or is it a plane, or
is it just a line?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.250
Well, the answer is plane.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.710
That probably even
gives us the answer.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.630
That's the good thing
about this subject.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.340
The answer is a plane because
I have two different lines that

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.410
meet at the 0.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.890
And when I fill in between
them, I have a flat plane.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.990
I don't go in the
third direction.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.890
Good.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.990
So that's the column
space for this matrix.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.960
And here's a little
more saying about that.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.760
We kept column 1.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.030
And we kept column 2
because you remember

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.203
those two columns, the
first two, were different.

00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:34.620
They went in
different directions.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.580
They go in different directions.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.080
We did not keep the third
column because it was just

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.310
the sum of the first two.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.760
It's on the plane, nothing new.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.890
So the real meat of the matrix
A is in the column matrix C

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.410
that has just the two columns.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.700
And what about R?

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.980
Because this is my plan
for the first few weeks,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.040
first two to three
weeks of linear algebra,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.190
is to understand.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.930
So that 5, 5, 3 would be called
a dependent vector because it

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.390
depends on the first two.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.730
Those were independent.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.190
So those are the two that
I keep in the matrix C.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.940
And then that matrix
R, oh, well, now I'm

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.500
multiplying two matrices.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.850
And you know how to do that.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.880
But I always have another
way to look at it.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.155
So the way I look at it
is by linear combinations.

00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:35.880
Do you remember those?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.140
So multiplying is a
combination of these guys.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.170
First, I have 1 of
the first column.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.870
That's my first column.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.880
And the next time, I have
1 of the second column.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.470
That's my second vector.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.640
And the third one is this
guy, 1 of that and 1 of that.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.260
So these two are the independent
ones, and that's dependent.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.930
And a full set of
independent ones

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.200
is called a basis,
really fundamental.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.050
So I guess I think that
linear algebra should just

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.580
start with these key
ideas, just go with them.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.650
And we learned something.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.250
It almost falls in our laps.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.870
It's a first great
and not obvious

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.690
fact about linear algebra.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.690
I'm just amazed to have it here.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:32.780
The number of independent
columns in A, which it was two,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.340
is equal to the number of
independent rows in R, also

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.980
two.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.570
You remember that we had
two rows and two columns?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.180
So two columns first in C,
two rows in R. And the point

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.190
is that that's telling us--

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.180
and we just checked that
those two rows were--

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.700
two columns were independent.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.500
The two rows are independent.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.690
The basis, and then we
learned that the column space

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.190
has dimension 2.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.750
R equals 2 for this example.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.380
And the row space has
the same dimension.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.610
So that column rank
R equals the row

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:21.980
rank R. It's like if you
had a 50 by 80 matrix,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.490
OK, that's 4,000 numbers.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.250
You couldn't see what
those these dimensions are.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.200
But linear algebra
is telling you

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.800
that a dimension of the row
space and the column space,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.220
50 of one and 80 in
another, are equal.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.630
OK, so this is again coming
early, and we'll see it again.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.100
But it's good to start
linear algebra from day one.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.630
And then here is another
great fact about equations

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.960
because matrices lead
to these two equations

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.530
where x is the unknown.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.550
And this equation has 0
on the right hand side.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.890
So how could we get 0
on the right hand side?

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.270
We could take 1 of that.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.130
And let me change that to a
minus sign and that to a minus

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.810
Sign.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.080
One of those minus one of
those minus one of those

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.540
would be 0, 0, 0.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.130
So that 1 and minus 1 and
minus 1 would tell us an x.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.105
And that's the solution.

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:28.620
In applying linear
algebra in engineering,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.420
in physics, in
economics, in business,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.880
you end up with equations.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.470
Things balance.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.220
And you want to know how
many solutions there are.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.790
And linear algebra was created
to answer that question.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.280
OK, so now, I'm just
going to say a little more

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.300
about this starting
method of the course.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.840
Oh, I want to focus here on
these interesting matrices,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.710
where every column is a
multiple of the first column.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.730
Every row is a multiple
of the first row.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.000
Instead of having two
independent columns and rows,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.130
these matrices have only one.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.280
So then C has one column.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.190
And R has one row.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.080
And the rank is 1.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.390
These are the building blocks
of linear algebra, these rank 1

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.130
matrices, column times row.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.740
The previous matrix would
have one of those blocks

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.410
and a second block.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.200
A big matrix from data science
would have hundreds of blocks.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.880
But the great theorem
in linear algebra

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.290
is to break that big matrix
into these simple pieces.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.010
So that's the goal for
the end of the course.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.520
OK, and finally, a last
thought about these.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.480
So this is C times R.
I'm urging teachers

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.950
to present that
part at the early.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.730
So what are the good things,
I've marked with a plus.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:12.190
First of all, the columns,
we're looking at them in C.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.702
And we see them from A. We
take them directly from A.

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:20.190
R turns out to be
a famous matrix.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.610
Row reduced echelon
form it's called.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.930
So to see that pop
up here is terrific.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.450
And then this
wonderful fact that row

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:36.270
rank equal column rank is
clear from this C times R.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.535
So those are all
terrifically good things.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.330
The other thing I have to
say is that C and R are not

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.330
great for avoiding
round off or being

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.970
good in large computations.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.110
This is a first
factorization but not

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.980
the best one for big computing.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.630
Right.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:08.000
So ill conditioned means they
are difficult to deal with.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.480
And also, we often have a
matrix with all the columns

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.710
are independent.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.780
And it's a square matrix.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.230
All the columns are independent.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.890
We can solve Ax
equals b all the time.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.960
But then if all the
columns are independent,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.440
then our matrix C is
just the same as A.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.090
We didn't get anywhere.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.360
And R would be the
identity matrix, like a 1,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.940
because A equals C. So
this is the starting point,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.320
picking out the independent
columns, but not the end,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.380
of course.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:52.140
And I'll stop here and pick
up on the next factorization

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.950
right away.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.500
Thanks.

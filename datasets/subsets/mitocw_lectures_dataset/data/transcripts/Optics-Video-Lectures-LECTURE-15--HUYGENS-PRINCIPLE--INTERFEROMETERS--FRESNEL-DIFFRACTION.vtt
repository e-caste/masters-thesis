00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:21.480
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.850
So you can see it's me again.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.360
So George can have
a holiday again.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.490
But he's not really
having a real holiday

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970
because he's
actually sitting in.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.135
And I guess one
reason why we decided

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.950
that he had to do that
was because I have

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.770
to use his computer
because he's written

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
these talks in this
strange application that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.485
doesn't run on my computer.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.940
So now we going to--

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.010
today, we're just about getting
into interesting stuff now.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.950
Seems rather a long time since
the beginning of this course

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.319
before we get into the
real wave optics, which

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.940
I'm sure everyone would agree
is the most interesting part.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.430
So this lecture is
about interferometry.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.102
And then the next lecture--

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.310
I don't know how much I'm
going to get through today,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
but the next lecture's
about diffraction.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.580
So these are two
techniques, two phenomena

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.840
that are obviously very
closely related to each other.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
So in this talk really two
types of interferometer--

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.980
the Michelson interferometer
and the Mach-Zehnder

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.330
interferometer.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.990
So it took me a few minutes
to understand this picture.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.040
But anyway, it
looks a bit messy.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.030
But in the end, I--

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.740
George drew this,
obviously, otherwise

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.680
I wouldn't be saying that.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.910
But what this is
showing, then, is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.039
trying to show how a wave varies
both in distance and in time.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.220
So the wave's propagating
along this z-direction.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.410
So if you look
along this z-axis,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.480
you will see this
amplitude variation

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.290
given by the black line.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.460
So a cosine-type variation.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.220
And then at any point, any
value of z, you can see,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.330
plotted in red, how the
amplitude will change

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.260
with time along this axis here.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.170
So you can see that you
get a sinusoidal variation

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.190
both in time and in space.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.870
And a reminder here, then,
how you can express this wave.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.200
This is a
sinusoidal-shaped wave,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.890
which is moving in the
positive z-direction.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.700
And you can either express
it in this form, which

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.180
is what you would actually
measure if you could really

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.480
measure it-- except that, as we
said before, you can't really

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.690
measure it because it's
moving too quickly.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.150
But normally we do
the manipulations

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.560
on the expressions using this
complex notation because it

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.050
makes it easier to do the sums.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.040
Yeah.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.660
So this is showing, then--

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.940
this is a particular
value of distance,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.140
then, and showing
how it changes here

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.720
the value of the phase of
this cosine wave at the time t

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.780
equals 0 according
to the value of z.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.300
I guess what that's
trying to show.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.780
And then let's think
now what happens

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.630
if we've got some plane
wave propagating along

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.160
at an angle with the axis.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.370
So here's this
wave coming along,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.490
which it's going along a line--

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.970
the direction of the
propagation of the wave

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.190
is along this
direction, which is

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.490
an angle theta with the axis.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.720
And so you can see that when
this wave reaches this plane z

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.160
equals fixed here-- so this is
some plane where we might put

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.030
a screen or detector
or something--

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.290
you can see that the different
parts of this phase front

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.510
are going to strike this
plane at different times.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.570
Or equivalent, you can say that
if you look at this plane here,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.910
this wave will experience--

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.180
exhibit-- different
phase at different points

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.200
along this line.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.390
And so this is what we're
looking at here then.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.460
As it says here, the path delay
increases linearly with x.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.040
So there'll be
somewhere where this

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.140
arrives at a phase of 0, which
I guess is this point here.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.870
And then on one
side, the phase is

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.120
going to be positive
and negative, according

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.980
to which way you go.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.040
So mathematically, this
is how we express this.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.900
So this is our wave, the
same as the previous slide,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.080
but now the wave is moving at
this angle theta to the axis.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.180
So we get this term.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.100
This is our-- you
remember, we expressed this

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:50.380
before as k.r for a wave moving
in general in a direction r.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:58.620
And so this-- so we
could write this then.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.200
This is what is in terms of
our phasor representation.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.000
So as before, we write this
as an e to the i type thing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.710
And then we also--

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.020
this e to the minus i omega
t, we just missed that out

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.680
for clarity, just
because we don't

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.070
want to have to write
that every time.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.210
So there's an e to
the minus i omega t

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.210
understood that we don't write.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.690
And k, of course,
is 2 pi over lambda.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.870
So k is related inversely to
the wavelength of the light.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.600
And so this thing here,
this complex number here,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.400
you could write this
as e to the i phi,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.890
like this, where phi is the
phase of the wave, which

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.520
is a function of position.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.520
And it can be written like this.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.690
So if we look at a
particular value of z,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.205
then this z is
going to be fixed.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.210
So this part, e to the i 2
pi over lambda z cos theta,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.100
is going to be fixed.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.230
And the phase
variation is only going

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.660
to be because of
this other part here.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.750
So this is another example.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:37.700
And so this shows spherical
waves or rather distorted

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.630
spherical waves they become
because of the advances

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.290
in modern technology that
love to distort everything

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.260
you draw and make
it so that it's

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.290
not the right shape anymore.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.510
But anyway, this is
a point source which

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.460
is giving out spherical waves.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.830
And you can see that here
we put our screen again

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.130
or whatever it is
that z equals z0.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.430
So you can see that these
waves, as they travel out here,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.610
they're traveling a
different distance

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.170
before they get to the screen.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.920
So you can see that's
going to do two things.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.040
One is, of course, the amplitude
is going to decay as 1 over r.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.280
So the amplitude of the wave
when it reaches out here

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.920
is going to be smaller
than the amplitude here.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.370
But much more important
is the phase effect

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.539
because you can see
the phase actually

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.039
might change tremendously.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.400
Because the
wavelength is so small

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.740
compared with
these distances, it

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.040
means that you only have to
go quite a small distance

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.790
before you get a big
change in the phase.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.690
So that's what we want
to be able to quantify.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.200
And so here we're riding
our spherical wave,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.250
just like we did before.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.480
So George has kept this the
same as he's said before.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.020
You'll notice that it's
got this funny pi over 2

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.350
in there, which he
introduced that before.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.630
It has the effect of making
this like a sine, of course.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.350
Something minus pi
by 2 is like sine.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.240
This is actually like
a sinc type function.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.260
And that's the reason why
that pi over 2 is there.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.350
It's so that it
doesn't blow up when

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.380
you look at what
happens at x equals

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.980
y equals z equals t equals 0.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.780
If you didn't have
the pi over 2 there,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.400
you'd have horrible infinities.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.180
So you avoid those by
putting this pi over 2 there.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.290
And yeah.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.900
So this is the radius.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.160
r is just the square
root of x squared

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.090
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.030
So this is kr minus omega t.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.650
And this is our r at the bottom.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.680
And now we make
an approximation.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.080
The approximation
we're going to make

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.260
is that we're not actually
really looking at this geometry

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.980
as shown in the picture, but
we're looking at the geometry

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.430
when, actually, we're only
looking in a small region

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.470
near to the axis.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.370
What that really, in
physical practice,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:33.150
that means is that this
distance z0 becomes very large.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.000
We're a long way
away from the source.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.230
And so we can think of this
value z being a very large.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.730
Sorry.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.050
You understand my
funny English language,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.040
don't you, when I
talk about "zeds"?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.840
What you call "zees."

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.330
I just suddenly realized that.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.260
Anyway.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.480
So we've already had this before
in earlier lectures as well.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.660
This is a square root that
we can expand by the binomial

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.820
and assume that z is large
much larger than x and y.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.990
So you take out a factor
z, and the square root

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:20.300
becomes 1 plus a half-something.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.330
And so eventually you
get this sort of thing.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.480
So that's what we do
inside this phase term.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.260
But the thing at
the bottom, we say

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.330
we don't have to be
so careful with that

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.540
because it's not so
sensitive to this amplitude

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.900
because all it does
is just changes

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.890
the magnitude of the
wave by a small amount.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.500
Because we've said
x and y is small.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.090
But up here, you have to be
more careful because we're

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.540
talking about phases.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.690
So anyway, at the bottom, we
can just neglect the x and y.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.310
So that's where the z
has come from there.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.720
And when we do this
binomial thing on the top,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.090
we get this
expression here then.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:16.520
So the dependence on
x and y, you can see,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.400
just becomes a
quadratic type term--

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.530
x squared plus y
squared over 2z.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.210
And so this is what this
picture is drawing here.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.460
The path delay increases
quadratically with x.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.950
So as you go further,
this point here

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.040
corresponds to the
center of the screen.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:43.050
And then as you go
further away, this

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.850
increases with some parabolic
variation like this.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.790
So that's doing it in
terms of the cosines.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:00.190
If we go in terms of the
complex exponentials,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.860
much the same sort of approach.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.060
You can just expand,
again, the square root

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.830
inside the exponential now.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.990
Exactly the same, really.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.410
And you end up getting
this expression here.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.140
And so this is an
example now, you

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.850
can see, of the power of
this complex exponential form

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:32.390
though because this complex
exponential of here two, terms

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.270
or it might be more
terms in general,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.510
you can just expand
them, can't you?

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.210
You can just say that
multiplied together.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.710
Whereas if it was
cosine, of course,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.140
you'd have to remember all
these things-- cos of a plus

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.320
b plus c.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.580
Horrible.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.910
I don't know why I'm
making funny noises.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.550
Maybe I shouldn't keep
getting too near the speakers.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.260
Is that what it is?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.760
Yeah.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.010
So with the complex
exponentials,

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.290
we can break it up very simply.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.730
And this inside the braces,
then, is our phi before,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.240
or i phi.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.950
So we can say this is e0 e
to the i phi, where the phase

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:24.540
phi has just got this parabolic
term, plus some constant term,

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.740
which corresponds to
this, which corresponds,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.705
of course to this distance--

00:14:28.705 --> 00:14:31.080
the phase that you get through
traveling in that distance

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.390
there.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.830
So that's how you
get a phase delay.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.435
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:38.310
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.148
AUDIENCE: What happened to
the pi over 2 in the phasor?

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.690
COLIN SHEPPARD: What happened
to the pi over 2 in the phasor?

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.420
So we've got good--

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.120
it's there, isn't it?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.910
And then it's disappeared.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.990
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Ah, the i outside.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.620
There it is.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.540
It's that one.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.110
Yeah.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.610
OK.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.560
So it's an i outside.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.092
And yeah.

00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:18.300
That's an interesting-- I
think George said something

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.310
about that before
because effectively it

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.830
makes this wave 90
degrees out of phase.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:31.680
And I like to think
of that as being

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.110
related to some sort of
resonance-type phenomenon.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.060
If you excite something
that resonates,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.520
then it's going to resonate 90
degrees out of phase, isn't it?

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:51.630
So if you've got a point source
and you excite it with a wave,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.730
then the scattered wave is going
to be 90 degrees out of phase

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.780
with the driving force, just
because it's like a resonance.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.860
And I guess that's also
true in the Huygens' thing

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.200
that we come on in
the next lecture.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.700
But yeah.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.030
OK.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.238
Thanks for pointing that out.

00:16:10.238 --> 00:16:14.150
I'd forgotten that.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.520
OK.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.630
Other than that
it's fine, isn't it?

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.130
I hope.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.810
So we're now going on
to discuss something

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.010
about the significance there.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.510
Yeah.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.080
So the point is, I
mentioned that there

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.000
is this modulus term,
intensity-type term.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.790
But this is a very weak change.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.810
So you can imagine, if you're
trying to do an experiment,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.740
to actually measure the
properties of that wave field

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.970
by looking at the intensity
would be quite tough because we

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.030
said that these two
terms are very much

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.930
smaller than that one.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.820
So looking at the
phase of the signal

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.829
is a much more sensitive way
to look at that wave front.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:10.000
And as it says, the
phase can tell us

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.849
all sorts of things
about the wave,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:17.349
like where the wave has come
from, how far it's traveled,

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:22.510
the materials it's gone
through, and generally

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.890
the optical path,
which you remember

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.130
we had optical path
before, integral ndz.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.590
So that will change the phase.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.410
And so if we can
measure the phase,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.870
we can find out information
about those things.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.660
The problem, though,
as we've said before,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.630
is that the phase is not
something you can actually see

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.690
directly, because it's so fast.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.520
So 10 to the minus--

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.370
10 to the 15 hertz is typical.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.180
Very, very fast.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.510
Much faster than you can
measure with any electronics.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.350
So how do we do this?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:03.260
We do it by some form
of interferometry,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.150
which is basically mixing
it with a reference beam.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:13.670
And then you look at the
intensity of the interference

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.200
between the two waves.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.410
So this is how we do it.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.810
So I said that
we're going to look

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.000
at two types of interferometer.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.770
The first one is the
Michelson interferometer.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.610
So this is how you make a
Michelson interferometer.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.660
You get light from some
source and split it

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.740
into two parts with
a beam splitter.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.110
And one of those beams is
what we call the signal arm.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.250
This is what we're going
to try and measure.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:49.310
So here, this shows this light
going through some object,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.660
and then being
reflected by a mirror,

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.780
and then coming
back to a detector.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.710
And then the other arm
is the reference arm.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.860
So this is going to
produce a reference signal.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.710
So effectively, we're
going to be comparing

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.260
the phases in those two arms.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.580
So the reference
beam comes down also.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.880
So these add together.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.150
So we can add them as phasors.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.890
This is for the reference beam.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.340
Ar e to the i phi r.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.960
For the signal beam we've
got As e to the i phi s.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.490
We add the amplitude because
we're assuming it's coherent.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.790
Maybe I ought to stress
that a bit, of course.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:39.020
So this is assuming that
this is a coherent--

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.740
these two beams a coherent
with respect to each other.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:50.120
So if you had light here from
a laser, that would be true.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.450
And we'll probably
come onto cases where

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.850
it might not be true later on.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.010
Once we've got the
amplitude, then we just

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.070
have to find the modulus
square to find the intensity.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.980
And if you remember,
there's actually

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.840
a proportional sign here.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.520
There's some funny
constants with epsilon

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.260
a half and things, which we
just don't usually worry about.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:21.550
So these phases tell
us the optical path

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.580
that the light has gone
through in these two arms

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.260
in order to get to the detector.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.710
And so what we're
measuring is the difference

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.580
in the optical path
in those two arms.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.740
And so this shows
how that can work.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:42.130
So this is an example where
these two waves arrive in phase

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.180
with each other.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.780
So then they'll
add constructively

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.730
and you'll get a big
signal like that.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.020
On the other hand, you could
imagine that they might not

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.860
arrive like that.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.200
They might arrive in anti-phase
like this, in which case

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.930
you can see the two waves
now are going to cancel out.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.200
And you're not going to
see now any interference.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.390
In practice, of course, it could
be anything in between here.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.890
All right.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.080
So as you change--

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.460
you can change the relative
phase of this light

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.800
by changing the position
of this mirror or the size

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.650
or refractive index
of this object

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.410
that's in there, or the
wavelength of the light,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.397
or whatever.

00:21:27.397 --> 00:21:29.230
It's going to depend
on all of these things.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.330
So example, measuring distance.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.490
So we've said that
effectively what we're doing

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.610
is measuring the optical path.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.490
So optical path depends on
a few things, doesn't it?

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.580
Optical path depends
on the distance,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.340
it depends on the
wavelength, and it depends

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.420
on the refractive index.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.080
So these are all things
that you can measure

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.550
using this sort of system.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.650
So here it's talking
as an example.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.230
There's no object
in this one anymore.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.790
So this is just free space.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.780
And so in this case,
then, what you can measure

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.060
is the difference in the optical
path in this arm and this arm.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.200
And the optical path--

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.740
well, the refractive index
is now the same in each,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.730
the wavelength's
the same in each,

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.840
so you could measure
the distance.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.000
So this is an interferometer
for measuring distance.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.360
So where could you use this?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.500
Well, imagine, this might not
actually be a flat mirror.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.220
It might actually have some
structure there, in which case

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.160
you could actually measure
what that structure is,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.830
or if it was a mirror,
you could actually

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.820
use this to accurately measure
the distance of this mirror.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:58.060
How far away it is from the
instrument, so to speak.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.690
So the interesting thing--
another interesting thing--

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.870
this is the Michelson
interferometer.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.440
And the Michelson
interferometer,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.040
as the name says, was
invented by Michelson.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.290
Well, I think he
probably invented it.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.010
He certainly has his
name attached to it.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:22.090
But he mainly used it
for measuring wavelength.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:26.000
So we'll come back to that after
I've gone through the matter

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.830
bit, actually.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.720
I think it's probably best.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.500
Anyway.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.070
So what we've said is we add
together these two phases,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.300
find the modulus square, and
then we've got to expand that.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.370
So this is a square of
a sum of two things.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.790
So we're going to get the square
of this, the square of this,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:50.210
and then we're going to
get some cross terms.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.940
And this is what
it comes out to be.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.615
The two cross terms, one
is the complex conjugate

00:23:55.615 --> 00:24:00.060
of the other, which means that
when you add them together,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.880
the final result is real.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.830
That has to be true,
of course, because this

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:10.630
is an expression for intensity,
and intensity has to be real.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.110
And so we've written
it in this nice form,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:21.610
Ar squared plus As squared
plus 2 Ar As cos of something.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.730
And this thing
here, the something,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.590
is the difference between
the phases of the two beams.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.990
So this next line
puts it into a sort

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.250
of general term, general form.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:41.670
It's of the forms a
constant plus a cosine.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:47.600
And then these quantities,
i0 m and delta phi,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.320
you can also write in terms
of these other parameters

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.880
we had earlier.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.640
So as it says, when
both paths are clear,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.790
then these phases
adjust directly

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:08.400
proportional to the
distance ls and lr.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.800
And so the phase difference
is just k times the difference

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.020
in the two paths.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.910
So therefore, if you
measure the signal,

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.860
if you know what
the wavelength is,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.860
you can measure what the
difference in those two

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.230
distances is.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.380
There's a bit of
a proviso there,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.060
which is quite a big proviso,
that you can only do this,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.970
of course, modulo 2 pi.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:44.040
So because this is a cosine,
it's going to keep repeating.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.030
And you won't know which
of the cycles you're on.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.410
So it means that interferometry
is usually very sensitive.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:59.040
You can measure very, very small
distances, easily much smaller

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.720
than the wavelength.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.350
And people sometimes talk
about measuring hundredth

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.400
of an Angstrom and
amazing small quantities

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.480
using interferometry.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.160
The LIGO project, I don't
know what they're claiming.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.780
10 to the minus 15 meters
or something they're

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:24.345
trying to measure to detect
these gravitational waves.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.540
Anyway.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.680
Yeah.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.200
So you only measure
it modulo 2 pi.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.410
So that means that if you're
trying to use this method

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.470
to measure-- for
example, I'm looking

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.680
at the door at the back
of the lecture theater.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.180
If I'm trying to
use this to measure

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.860
the distance of that door,
I can measure the distance

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.920
to an accuracy,
maybe, of something

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.960
smaller than a micron.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.840
But I wouldn't really know
whether it had added to that 10

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.250
meters or whatever.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.330
So that actually has been what--

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.280
a lot of people have
put effort into trying

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.770
to develop interferometric
methods that you

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:15.560
can get that extra information
so that you can actually

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.880
do what we call unwrapping,
because this is like--

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.930
they sometimes call
this phase wrapping.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.680
The phase wraps
because of the cosine.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.140
And so you don't know which
of these lobes you're on.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.710
Yeah.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.140
Well, going back to Michelson.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.730
So Michelson did this
the other way around.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.400
He knows this distance
and uses this expression

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.910
to find the wavelength or
the k value or whatever.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.770
And that's, of course, what
you do in an interferometer,

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.970
isn't it?

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.510
If you do a Fourier
transform interferometer,

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:58.970
you're using that as
a way of measuring

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.880
the wavelength of the light.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.370
In the case of Michelson,
he looked at various things.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.060
He didn't look at lasers because
there weren't any lasers then.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.600
But he looked at light
from discharge tubes

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.970
and various different
types of lamp and so on.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.140
And he looked at
how the signal would

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.610
vary as you move this mirror.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.870
And it turns out that if
you do move the mirror

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.630
and you know accurately how
you're moving the mirror,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.150
you can actually
work out from that

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:37.920
what the spectral
distribution of the source is.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:46.120
That also suggests a way
around this wrapping problem.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.390
The way around the wrap or a
way around the wrapping problem

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.700
is to use not just one
wavelength but many

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.150
wavelengths.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.380
So even two wavelengths
is a big help, actually.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.230
Yeah.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.330
It's quite interesting
that Michelson--

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.670
I think I've spoken about
this with some of my students

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.970
before, that Michelson, he wrote
quite a lot about measuring

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.700
wavelengths using
that interferometer.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.200
And then many, many
years later, people

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.370
came up with this
bright idea of using

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.980
what they call the low
coherence interferometer

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.380
or the white light
interferometer

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.030
to measure distances.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:36.130
But as far as I know,
Michelson never suggested this.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.780
I've never found it in
any of these papers.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.280
Anyway.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.800
So this is another application.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.370
Here we're going to
look at a real object

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.080
that we put in there and try
and find out something about it.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.910
So we put in this lump
of material, length

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.010
l, a certain refractive index.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:02.220
And you can see now then that
the phase of this light when

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:09.480
it gets there is going to be
changed by the light traveling

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.490
through that material.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:18.760
And have we taken
into account, George,

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.710
that it's gone
through twice here,

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.020
or even on the previous one?

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.560
There ought to be a 2 in there.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.520
There ought to be a 2
in here, oughtn't there?

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.020
All right.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.760
So the phase difference
is actually twice this

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.650
because it has this amount of
phase difference on the way

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.880
in and on the way out.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.200
So I hadn't noticed
that before either.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.500
But it applies to
this next one as well.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.940
So this one, the light goes
through this object here.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.030
And so there's this
extra phase delay

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.790
that comes because of this
object, which is this bit here.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.610
So again, there ought
to be a factor of 2

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.890
for all of these terms.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.010
And so there we are, though.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.970
We've got this
extra optical path

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:22.880
and so now we can measure the
optical path of that object.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.160
Again, modulo 2 pi.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.110
So if this is many
wavelengths, you

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.920
might have trouble
to know exactly how

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.230
long it is, of course, because
of the wrapping of the phase

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.730
again.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:49.530
So this modulo 2 pi we
can actually measure--

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.800
this is the optical
path difference.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.330
n minus 1 times L.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.330
The minus, of course,
is because the other--

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.310
the reference beam
has gone through air

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.470
when this has gone
through this material.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:07.020
So what we measure is n minus 1
times L. If you knew what n is,

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.570
we can know what L is.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:13.140
If we knew what L is,
we could know what n is.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.010
But as it says there, if
you don't know either,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.740
then you can't find either.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.100
All you know is
what n minus 1 L is.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.550
Anyone got any ideas
about how you might--

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.700
what might you do
to get both of those

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.430
if you wanted to
know both of those?

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.170
Any ideas how you could do that?

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.947
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:39.947 --> 00:32:41.530
COLIN SHEPPARD: Based
on what, though?

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.440
You'd have to have
two measurements.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.963
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Press the button, please.

00:32:46.963 --> 00:32:52.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.702
Someone says it's to use
two wavelengths to set up

00:32:54.702 --> 00:32:55.660
simultaneous equations.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.350
COLIN SHEPPARD: Exactly.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.880
Good one.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.380
Yeah.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.613
Who said it?

00:32:58.613 --> 00:32:59.780
Someone in the back said it.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.200
AUDIENCE: I heard it somewhere.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.030
COLIN SHEPPARD:
You're not getting

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.072
the full credit for that.

00:33:03.072 --> 00:33:03.697
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:03.697 --> 00:33:04.240
Yeah.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.340
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Anyway, someone got it.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.090
So yeah.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.680
So if you measured this for
two different wavelengths,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.500
then you could have a pair
of simultaneous equations,

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.070
and you could solve
for both of those.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.480
That, of course, assuming
that there is no dispersion.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.550
If n changes with
wavelength, then you

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.960
are still back to square
one, unless you do

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.670
some more wavelengths I guess.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.490
But anyway, yeah.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.900
So it just shows
you, though, you

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.530
can do a lot of these
experiments very easily.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.260
So now let's sort
of-- these are used--

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.120
this Michelson
interferometer is used

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.060
a lot in metrology,
industrial sort of metrology.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.310
And all countries have their--

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.500
in the US, it used to
be called the National

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.030
Bureau of Standards, didn't it?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.595
But I don't know that
that exists anymore.

00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:01.720
AUDIENCE: It's called NIST.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.320
COLIN SHEPPARD: NIST.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.820
NIST.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.070
That's right.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.570
It changed.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.350
I don't know why it
changed its name.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.920
But anyway, so all
countries have got this.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.409
They have this
standard measures.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:18.100
They have procedures for
calibrating distances

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.760
and so on.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.900
And the idea is that if a
company like General Motors

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:33.940
is making parts for a
car, that those parts will

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:39.280
fit as a spare for another car
that's made by another factory.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.440
So say you make
some shaft that's

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.699
supposed to be 1
inch in diameter,

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.440
you want it to be
accurately 1 inch diameter.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.230
Otherwise, the
bit from one place

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.630
wouldn't fit the
bit from the other.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.290
There is actually a
true story about that.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.060
A thing called the Vickers inch.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.550
Vickers is an engineering
company in the UK.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.990
And this Vickers
inch was a big thing

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.840
that came up during
the Second World War,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.780
where lots of
factories all over UK

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.140
were converted to
make munitions.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.250
And somewhere down
the line, people

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.430
realized that Vickers had a
different inch from everyone

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.080
else.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.690
So when they made
a shell and tried

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:39.300
putting it in the barrel of
the gun, it didn't quite fit.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.130
So eventually that
was sorted out.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.750
They worked out what
the problem was.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:48.280
And I guess it's that sort
of problem that makes it

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.720
so that the companies now--

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.650
obviously the countries keep
these standards and so on.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.210
So the sort of
thing you might do

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.540
is measure the height of this.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.860
Let's say you put in--

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.338
they have these things
called gauge blocks.

00:36:05.338 --> 00:36:06.880
A lot of you are
mechanical engineers

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.900
so you must know
about gauge blocks.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.760
So you can buy these
standard lumps of metal that

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.870
have got a certain thickness.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.850
And so you put this
lump of metal in here

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.886
and measure the thickness of
it using an interferometer.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.310
So these standards,
of course, they

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.260
have these what they
call primary standards,

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.320
and then they're handed down.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.250
I'm not quite sure how
the length works anymore,

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.070
but it's all defined in terms
of the wavelength of something,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.570
isn't it?

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.350
And then all of the
countries around the world,

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.890
they all have to
compare their meter

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.300
to make sure that they've
all got the same meter.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.050
And then within each country--

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:58.710
so in the US, NIST would then
be measuring these gauge blocks

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.430
that would be sent to
them from other companies

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.430
to make sure that they've
got the right size.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.140
And then in the
companies, then they

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.320
would compare those gauge
blocks against other gauge

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.720
blocks and other things.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.540
So this is what you use-- one
of the things you use this for.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.280
So now, fringe visibility.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.780
Yeah.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.638
So we've said that
you get these fringes.

00:37:26.638 --> 00:37:28.930
Perhaps I ought to go back
and explain that a bit more.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.670
Back to this one.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.990
So you can see here
we've got a constant term

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.370
plus a sinusoidal-type term
or cosinusoidal-type term.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:49.180
And you can see that this
term m is called the contrast

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.160
or fringe visibility.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.720
So if m is 1, then you can see
that they are going to be--

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.020
for particular
values of delta phi,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.780
this intensity is
going to go to 0.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.740
So that's when you get--

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.500
you've got very high
fringe visibility.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.600
And you can see
that this visibility

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:18.610
depends on this, Ar 2 Ar As
over ir squared plus As squared.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.890
And you can show
quite easily that that

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.600
is going to reach a maximum.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.690
It's going to be equal
to 1 when Ar equals As.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.500
So if you ensure
that Ar equals As,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.820
then you're going to get
your visibility of 1.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.190
I guess it can't be bigger
than 1 because that would

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.070
mean that the intensity
would go negative,

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.290
which is not possible.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.070
So this plots what it is--

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:53.510
what you would see as
a function of delta phi

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.110
and for a particular value of n.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.660
So there's some background,
sometimes called the bias.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.480
And then you've got some
wiggles on top of that.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.460
And so this plot is
plotted against delta phi.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.260
Delta phi could change by
a number of different ways,

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.060
of course.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.450
One way it could change is if
you actually move the mirror.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.090
Another way it could change
is if you tilted the mirror.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.250
If you tilted the
mirror, then there'd

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.070
be different delta phis
at different transverse

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.050
positions on the mirror.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:32.390
And if we take Ar equal As, then
you've got perfect contrast,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.190
m equals 1.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.640
You see it goes
right down to zero.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.400
And that's the high
visibility of the fringes

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.480
that you can get.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:47.030
If, on the other hand,
you find that if you take,

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.610
let's say, the
reference beam to be

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.940
much stronger than
the signal beam,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.610
then you can see that m
is going to tend to zero.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.020
The contrast is going
to become very weak.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:05.090
Actually, sometimes
people do do that.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.050
Contrast is not necessarily
the most important thing

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:16.770
because if you notice what
we had before, you see that--

00:40:23.485 --> 00:40:25.367
let's go back to
the previous one.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.380
Yeah.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.120
Let's go back to this one here.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.580
You can see that you've
got these three terms.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.220
So what we're saying
is if you make

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:41.970
Ar much bigger than As, then
you make the contrast is going

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.170
to get smaller and
smaller because obviously

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.500
this term is going to become
much bigger than this one.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.150
But nevertheless, it does
actually make this term bigger.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.210
So if actually what
you're trying to do

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.470
is measure this signal in
some background of noise,

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.450
it's sometimes a good thing
to make Ar bigger than As

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.960
because as you increase Ar,
it increases the strength

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.370
of this interference term.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.400
And that's the
principle that's used

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.290
in heterodyne interferometry.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:24.110
So not always true that you try
and make the contrast as big

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.160
as possible.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.407
Yeah.

00:41:26.407 --> 00:41:28.490
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: There
is one more factor of 2

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.020
missing here.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.410
On the left-hand side bottom,
the swing of the fringes

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.920
should be 2m times
i0 times-- yeah.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.240
There's a factor of 2 missing.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.260
That's quite unusual.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.620
Three slides in a row.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.060
They're all missing
a factor of 2.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.810
COLIN SHEPPARD: And
they don't cancel out.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.960
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.460
I guess.

00:41:53.098 --> 00:41:53.890
COLIN SHEPPARD: OK.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.920
So that's the Michelson
interferometer.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.280
So the Michelson interferometer
is basically, you can see,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.890
a sort of reflection
interferometer.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.008
And we're now going to
go into the Mach-Zehnder

00:42:06.008 --> 00:42:08.050
interferometer, which is
basically a transmission

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:09.230
interferometer.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.620
So the principle
is very similar.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.160
You split the light
into two parts.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.200
The two paths-- two light beams
go through different path,

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.640
and then you combine
them onto a detector.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.680
So this works in
transmission mode.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.920
Here you're looking
through an object.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.080
So now you're not going
to get that factor of 2,

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.400
of course, because the light
is only going through it once.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.890
So the light goes through here.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.550
You notice that the way
this has been drawn,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:47.750
it's been drawn so that this
light is going like this,

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.040
this light is going like this.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:56.710
So you can see this path and
this path are roughly equal.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:01.720
You might equally-- well, you
could have thought of making

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.540
this by doing it more like--

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.280
couldn't you?

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:14.500
You could have
done it like that.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.240
So where now you can see, if
we'd have made it like that,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.930
this path is obviously
longer than that path.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:35.250
So I guess nowadays if
you did that experiment

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:39.240
with a laser which has
got a very long coherence

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.390
length, something like a
frequency double YAG laser,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.040
this would work fine.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.780
If you tried doing this with
an arc lamp or something

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:54.060
like that it wouldn't work
because this distance is

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.410
much longer than the coherence
length of the source.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:02.400
So you're all used to the
idea that actually you

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.380
don't see interference
fringes all the time.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.890
In the normal,
regular, everyday life

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.620
you don't see interference
fringes very much.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.620
And that's because
in everyday life,

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.640
normally the light is
incoherent rather than coherent.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:23.700
So if you make this system here
or the Michelson interferometer

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:28.620
we showed before and you make
it so that these paths are

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.840
accurately the same
length, then you

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.085
could get interference
even with light from a--

00:44:37.085 --> 00:44:40.475
you can get interference even
from light from a tungsten lamp

00:44:40.475 --> 00:44:41.920
bulb.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.060
And they produce really
nice, beautiful fringes

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.470
with different colors.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:52.810
Maybe my students maybe
have seen these in the lab.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.480
But anyway.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.330
So here you can use this
to measure the optical path

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.890
of some object.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:03.050
And yeah.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:08.960
So this is now, again,
looking at this idea

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.720
of tilting something.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.450
I mentioned about tilting
with regard to the Michelson

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.260
interferometer.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.600
I said, if you tilt
one of those mirrors,

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.990
you would actually get the
optical path varying linearly

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.430
with transverse distance.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.700
So if you actually
looked at an image

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.010
of that interference,
what you would see

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.580
would be a series of fringes.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.700
And the spacing
between the fringes

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.490
would increase as you
increase the angle.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.440
So this is the same here.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.110
We're getting the offset
between these two paths--

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:55.220
these two beams-- by rotating
this mirror slightly.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.730
And then as you can see,
these two beams arrive

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.470
on a CCD camera, it shows here.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.740
So you will actually--
in this case,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.910
you would get some
variation in intensity

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.980
on this detector, which
you could actually

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.960
measure with the detector.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.520
So it would look
something like this.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.150
This would now be,
then, a function of x

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.870
rather than just being a
function of the optical path

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.540
difference.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.590
So this bit here, I guess, is
explaining, is deriving that.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.540
So we're adding
two wave together.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.050
One is arriving normally.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.720
The other one is tilted
through an angle theta.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:44.150
And so this one here is going
to have a linear phase variation

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.575
as a function of x, which will
then appear inside this cosine.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.350
So finally what
we get here then,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:59.870
the value of this bit
here, the z cos theta,

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:03.000
is just this constant here.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.850
So all that does is it shifts
these fringes this way.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.880
But normally, if you were
doing this experiment,

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.050
one thing you could
do then very simply

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.890
is to measure what this spatial
wavelength of these fringes is.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.850
And from that you
could, for example,

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:25.250
if you knew all
the other things,

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.680
you could measure what
this rotation theta was,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.820
couldn't you?

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.700
If you knew what the
rotation theta is,

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.980
then I don't know what
you could measure.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.250
But you could measure
something, probably.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.850
So the Mach-Zehnder,
I mentioned that this

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.640
is like a transmission
interferometer.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:50.180
The Michelson is like a
reflection interferometer.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.400
Both of these sorts
of interferometers

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.430
are used in
microscopy, actually.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.880
And so you can make an
interference microscope

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.330
based on this technique.

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.220
And you could put
in here, let's say,

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:08.540
a biological slide with a bit
of tissue or something on it.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.480
And you could use this to
measure the obstacle path

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.210
in going through that object.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:17.320
It's not trivial to do that.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.570
You'd normally, if you want
to do it in a microscope,

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.610
you'd have to place some
microscope objectives

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.650
and things in here.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.110
And usually it's found
that if you do that, that

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:28.640
messes everything up.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.580
So you normally have to put
the microscope objectives

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.500
in this one as well.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.160
So you end up really having
to have two microscopes,

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.180
and the whole thing
becomes very expensive.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.670
So that sort of method has
really gone out of fashion,

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.550
although many years
ago Zeiss and people

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.230
used to make
instruments like that.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.453
The same goes for a Michelson
type interferometer.

00:48:52.453 --> 00:48:53.870
You can measure
that for looking--

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:58.940
use that in a microscope
for looking at surfaces--

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.550
surface height
changes, and so on.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.700
OK.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.480
So this shows, again, how
this comes about, then.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.080
You've got this one wave, which
is coming along this angle

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.420
here.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.780
And so this
represents the phases.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.400
This is a movie.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.920
Do I just click it again and
it'll do something, will it?

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.010
Yes.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:27.960
There we are.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.460
OK.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.890
So it didn't go very far.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.180
Anyway.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.560
Probably it was
quick enough to see.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.820
It was a wave that's
moving this way.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:47.380
But the important thing, if
I go back and do it again--

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.050
OK.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.350
So you've all got
to watch this time.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.350
And there's two things
I want you to watch.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.860
One is the wave moving this way.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.720
But more importantly, look
what happens on this line

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.990
here where you've got
the camera placed.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.653
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:07.653 --> 00:50:08.570
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:08.770
Yeah.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:09.270
Yeah.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.060
Yeah.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.910
Otherwise, I think people
have to be very quick.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:31.720
Yes.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.570
Look at that.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:34.080
OK.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:34.750
So good.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.320
So this wave is moving out here.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.980
But you can see, if you look
at where the detector is,

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.310
it's as though the fringes--

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.960
the phase is actually
moving continuously

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.940
in one direction like that.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:07.490
So right.

00:51:14.645 --> 00:51:16.020
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So the point

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:20.190
is that the reference has
a constant phase because it

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:25.090
is normal on the vertical axis.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:30.810
So as the incident wave
is passing through,

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:38.220
the peaks are the
locations where

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.020
the intensity accumulates.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.210
So you end up getting a
peak, whereas in the nulls,

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:49.140
it means that as the
wave is passing through,

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.790
the phases are not lining up.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:53.070
So you end up getting a null.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:53.950
That's how you--

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:54.550
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:55.060
Yeah.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.440
OK.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:56.940
Yeah.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.340
So I guess the reference
beam, as you say,

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.650
is coming along this way.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.000
But of course, that's
got fringes as well.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.500
So--

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:05.990
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.200
COLIN SHEPPARD:
--the peaks of that,

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.420
when they match up with
the peaks of the other,

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:14.640
would give the maxima in the--

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.320
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: There's
locations where the peaks

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.840
always arrive at the same time.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.230
But a little bit
below, the peaks

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.940
will be actually out of phase.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.190
So they end up getting a null.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.357
COLIN SHEPPARD: End of show.

00:52:31.357 --> 00:52:32.440
So that's the end of that.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.420
That sounds like a
good place for a break.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.443
So let's make a break.

00:52:39.443 --> 00:52:41.360
Unless anyone's got some
questions, of course.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.110
Yeah, of course.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.547
[INAUDIBLE] always
got questions.

00:52:44.547 --> 00:52:46.130
AUDIENCE: In Michelson
interferometer,

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:52.430
the object would affect the
intensity according to whatever

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.290
phase delay it introduces.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.960
But in the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer,

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.500
it will affect the
spacing of the fringes.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.420
Is that correct?

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.310
It will change the spacing--

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:10.687
we added this constant
slope in the signal beam

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:11.520
in the Mach-Zehnder.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.250
COLIN SHEPPARD: I
think this tilting--

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:15.410
the tilting the one beam
relative to another you

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.662
can doing either sort
of interferometer.

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.120
That's not a
fundamental difference

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120
between the two types.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.650
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:29.900
So I was thinking, when you have
a tilted plane, tilted mirror,

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.320
then you would measure the
spacing between fringes

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.360
to find out the object's
optical path length.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.420
But if you didn't
have that, then you

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.640
would just measure the
change in intensity

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.433
to get the wrapped phase
and then apply unwrapping.

00:53:50.433 --> 00:53:51.100
Is that correct?

00:53:54.163 --> 00:53:56.580
COLIN SHEPPARD: Well, it depends
what you're trying to do.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.530
AUDIENCE: To find out the phase.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:58.770
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.270
Yeah.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.790
Yeah.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.500
You're thinking of it varying.

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.353
It's a spatially-varying
quantity

00:54:05.353 --> 00:54:07.020
that you're trying
to measure, isn't it?

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:07.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:07.800
Yeah.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.240
COLIN SHEPPARD: So I mean,
very often what you do,

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.510
of course, is you
actually-- very

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.510
often you want the fringes
because they give you something

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.270
to actually look at.

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:22.800
So normally, if you don't
do the tilting thing,

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.210
what you'd see if the two
paths were equal would be,

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.210
let's say, completely
featureless, bright,

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:31.590
wouldn't it?

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.090
COLIN SHEPPARD: And so let's
say you put some object in there

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.490
which has got some
phase change, you

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:42.600
would just see a small change
from that bright, which

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.793
might not be very visible.

00:54:43.793 --> 00:54:44.460
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.030
Yeah.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:51.900
COLIN SHEPPARD: But for example,
then, if you tilted the system,

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.800
then you would get some fringes.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.890
And the sort of thing you
might see, of course--

00:54:55.890 --> 00:55:00.410
let's say you put in a
disk of material like this

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.240
and you're trying to measure
the thickness of this disk

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.920
of material--

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.970
so what you would find is if
it was nicely uniformly thick,

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.210
you'd find that you've got
these regular sort of fringes

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:17.480
across here, whereas
if it wasn't, then

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.410
you might find that
you get fringes

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:24.310
that have got some shape that
looks something like this.

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:27.770
So by looking at the
geometry of those fringes,

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:32.930
you can quite easily measure
the changes and the deformations

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:33.940
in the shape of it.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.930
And as you change the tilt,
it would change the separation

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.710
between these fringes.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.810
And so if you make
the tilt very small,

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:51.500
then you'd just effectively be
looking at just a single fringe

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.720
or no fringes, really.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.530
So then it would be
actually very difficult

00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:00.110
to see the changes
in the thickness

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:05.241
unless you actually made
very sensitive measurements.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.440
OK.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.650
So everyone back again.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:18.680
Yeah.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:22.160
I thought of something
else that perhaps I

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.600
could mention following
on from this diagram.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:34.100
So in the lectures, the
system, as you remember,

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:38.800
was arranged to do
this sort of thing.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.370
So the idea here is
that the two paths now--

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:48.090
this path and this path--
are roughly equal in size.

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:50.070
In the old days,
when people were

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:56.220
trying to do this with
non-coherent sources,

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.590
then you had to
be really careful.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.520
And for example, this is a beam
splitter, which is actually,

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.410
of course, a lump of glass
maybe with some coating on it

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.910
on one side.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:12.030
But you can see this beam
has gone through this glass

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:15.740
but this beam hasn't
gone through that glass.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.230
And so these are all
things that you also

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:19.590
have to take into account.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:25.730
And so in order to correct for
the optical effects of, say,

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:28.910
for instance, that
slab of glass there,

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:32.870
you might actually end up
putting a slab of glass

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.310
in here--

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:41.050
some sort of compensating
piece of glass--

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:45.360
so that this would produce
the same dispersion

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.560
in the two arms.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.600
So there was a lot of
effort put into trying

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.220
to design these
systems so that they

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.320
would work with the
broadband sources and so on.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.000
Nowadays, I guess, most of the
time we're doing it with lasers

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.890
and we don't have to worry
about any of these things,

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:05.010
but if you look in any
of the standard books

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:07.950
on interferometry,
there are a number

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:09.960
of textbooks on
interferometry that

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.640
will give you all
the information

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.060
if you want to go more into it.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:20.490
So now we're going to change
step slightly from interference

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:22.680
to diffraction.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.290
And so what's the difference
between interference

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:26.670
and diffraction?

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.030
The answer is really not a
lot, except that normally

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:34.980
interference we're talking
about two beams interfering,

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:39.450
whereas in diffraction we're
normally talking about lots

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:40.980
of beams interfering.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:45.930
So you can think of the two
as really being effectively

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:49.620
the same phenomenon, actually.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:55.310
And so we're going to look
at Huygens' principle.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:58.460
We're going to go on to
the Young's interferometer.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:01.220
So this really does
show, doesn't it,

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:04.940
how interferometry is
related to diffraction

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.670
because this lecture is
really about diffraction.

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:11.210
And then we're going to go
to a more complicated case

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.670
of Fresnel diffraction.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.370
So first of all
Huygens' principle.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:25.580
So I think at the beginning
of the lecture course,

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.840
George said a bit about
the history of how

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.130
Huygens' came up with this
idea quite a long time ago,

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.630
wasn't it?

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.580
It was even before
Newton or around--

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:39.880
I think slightly before but
around the same time as Newton.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.900
So when people
still hadn't really

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.920
decided whether light
was a wave or a particle.

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.860
And of course, we
still haven't decided.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:53.260
So times don't change, really.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:56.680
But anyway so probably
now, looking back,

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.130
we could say that Newton was
the first quantum opticist.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.010
But anyway.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:06.220
So this was this
was Huygens' idea.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.570
He was saying that if you
think of a light beam--

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:14.620
a wave propagating in space,
then at some moment in time

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.050
this is a wavefront.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:21.890
The wavefront is a
surface of constant phase.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:29.900
And he came up with this model
for how light propagates where

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:35.420
he assumed that all the
points on this wavefront

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.030
can be thought of as
being a source of what

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.080
he called secondary wavelets.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.690
So each of these points
radiates like a spherical wave.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:48.650
And then if you sum those
all up and calculate

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:52.950
what the effect is at some
distance in front here,

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:58.110
then that would then predict
what that wavefront--

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.750
what the wave had done
at a slightly later time.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.940
So that's the principle.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:09.440
And so quite a
simple idea, really.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:16.100
And you can come up with a very
simple mathematical description

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.240
of it.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.940
Unfortunately, it doesn't
work marvelously well.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.420
And people put a lot
of effort into trying

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.610
to improve the theory.

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:30.560
And they came up with
some rather arbitrary--

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.480
they seem rather arbitrary--

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.420
factors that they had
to include in order

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.960
to get it to work properly.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.250
So I think nowadays we probably
look back over all this

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.500
and think it was just history.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.310
And there are better ways of
really tackling the problem.

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.240
But anyway, at the very
simple level though,

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.350
it's still a nice simple
theory for how you do that.

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.070
So if you want to calculate
what the field is at this point

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.200
here, say, you look
at all these waves

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.840
that come from all these
points on the wavefront,

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.980
add them all together
as phases, of course,

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.110
and that will give you
the field at that point.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.270
And there it's showing
how you do that.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.420
And then you can do it
again and again and again

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.040
and show how the
wave propagates.

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:25.930
So example, a hole
in an opaque screen.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.900
So I guess this is pretty
well the simplest example

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.660
you could possibly think of.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.790
Well, no, I suppose the
opaque screen with no hole

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.050
in would be even simpler.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.390
Then you wouldn't see anything.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:41.350
But what we do is we just have
a very small hole in this.

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:45.130
And so this is going to
act like a source that's

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:49.810
going to radiate like
a spherical wave.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:54.190
And what we'd see on this
screen that we place here,

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:58.030
you'd see that is
virtually what we've

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.700
been looking at before anyway.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.180
We've done that before.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.100
So there we are.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.990
There's the spherical wave.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:10.653
And then we can-- are we going
to get some more on that?

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:12.070
Did something
happen then, George?

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.306
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:16.167
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.500
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah! e to the ir.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:17.870
Right.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:18.370
Sorry.

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:20.500
I couldn't see
anything happening.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.200
So this is the plane
wave coming in.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.600
And now something's come up--

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.023
the hole is a delta function.

01:03:31.023 --> 01:03:31.940
Did that just come up?

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.982
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yep.

01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:37.880
COLIN SHEPPARD: And now
something else has come up.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.910
This is the spherical wave now.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:41.450
And this is the
same expression we

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.820
had for the spherical wave in
the previous lecture, then.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:50.300
So you remember this
parabolic type approximation

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.360
we made for a spherical wave.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.550
This is called the
Fresnel approximation,

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:02.030
named after the guy Fresnel
who I guess must have come up

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.280
with this in the first place.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.860
And you remember it's true--

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:12.260
it's going to be approximately
true if the x and y are small

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.030
compared with the distance l.

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.960
So you need that in order
to apply the binomial.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:21.230
Right.

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:22.580
So there it is.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.540
I'll just mention again
this i that someone from MIT

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.090
asked about earlier.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:34.190
So that i then at the bottom is
saying that this spherical wave

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:38.870
is actually 90 degrees
out of phase with the wave

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.870
that arrives at this point.

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:43.320
So that's quite interesting.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.350
So you can think of it
being like a resonance

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.500
sort of effect, I think.

01:04:50.965 --> 01:04:53.090
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
guess this is something that

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.970
Huygens' principle cannot
really explain, right?

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:58.430
This is why you have to
do more than Huygens'.

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:00.470
But we take it for
granted in the class,

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:02.285
so we don't get into it.

01:05:02.285 --> 01:05:03.160
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:03.590
OK.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:03.890
Yeah.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:04.390
Yeah.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:07.610
So I think George is really
saying that Huygens' didn't

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:11.420
actually have that i there.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.335
So we're cleverer than he is.

01:05:13.335 --> 01:05:14.960
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
We don't know why.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.990
COLIN SHEPPARD: So
there we are then.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:25.110
And oh.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:26.540
Now we've got two holes.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.210
I knew something had happened.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.226
And the spherical wave is now
hidden behind here partly.

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:32.726
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
More will come.

01:05:32.726 --> 01:05:34.820
COLIN SHEPPARD: More will come.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.560
So now we've got two holes.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.290
Each of these is
a spherical wave.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.543
And of course, when
we get two of them,

01:05:41.543 --> 01:05:43.460
there's going to be two
spherical waves, which

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.140
I think is going to-- oh, yes.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.115
Another spherical wave.

01:05:46.115 --> 01:05:47.870
Ah, and another equation.

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:48.740
There we are.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.550
So these are the
equations of what

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:56.330
you see on the screen for each
of these two spherical waves.

01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.980
And if you look at
them, you'll notice

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:04.827
that these are distance x0 and
minus x0 relative to the axis.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:07.160
And you can see the only
difference in these expressions

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:11.080
is this sign, plus
or minus there.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.795
So we now want to
add those together.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:23.068
And so here we're looking
at some observation point.

01:06:23.068 --> 01:06:24.735
You've got to add
those things together.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.000
Yeah.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.900
So of course, as
it explains here,

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.040
if this distance-- we
look at this distance

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.850
and this distance, if the
path difference between those

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.460
is an exact number
of wavelengths,

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.140
then they're going
to add up in phase.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.990
If they're exact number
of half wavelengths,

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:50.500
then you're going to get
destructive interference.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.890
And you're going to
get a black region.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:06:59.360
So there they are.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.210
There's the distances d1 and d2.

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:05.290
This is the
expressions for those.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:09.060
And again, we can use
this Fresnel approximation

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.130
to expand the square root.

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:15.150
And then d2 minus d1 is
going to be this minus this.

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:17.360
And you see the
only difference--

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.140
there's a sine there, George.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:27.640
And so yeah.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.830
So there's going to be
4x0 x dashed over 2l.

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:35.170
So one of the twos
cancels and you get this.

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:41.360
So the optical path length,
optical path difference,

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.220
is this.

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.080
2x0 x dashed over l.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.830
So x0 is this distance here.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.600
x dashed is this distance here.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.020
So both of those are
small quantities.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.700
And l, of course,
is a big quantity.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:06.700
So this is actually, then, in
terms of distance, of course.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.730
You know two distances
up the top and a distance

01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:11.120
at the bottom.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.130
This has got the right
dimensions of length

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:16.080
for optical path.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:20.430
Right.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:25.050
So as we said, that should give
constructive and destructive

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:26.229
interference.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:30.660
What you're going to see
is just fringes like this.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:34.890
So there's going to be
positions where these two add up

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:40.784
in phase and positions where you
get destructive interference.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:51.240
So if the optical path
difference is equal to lambda,

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.689
then if you put lambda
equal to this thing,

01:08:54.689 --> 01:09:01.140
then you get that x dashed
is lambda l over 2x0.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.918
So this then tells you--

01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:05.460
if you made this n
lambda, of course,

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.439
you'd have an n in here.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.649
But this distance here to--

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:17.430
this distance to there is given
by this lambda l over 2x0.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:26.819
So you can see the smaller x0
is, the bigger x dashed is.

01:09:26.819 --> 01:09:30.590
The smaller you make this,
the bigger you make this.

01:09:42.337 --> 01:09:42.920
What happened?

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.029
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah.

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:49.319
That's facing there.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:56.490
So this the spacing
of the fringes, then.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.700
It's this lambda l over 2x0.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.770
OK.

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:08.560
And so this is going
through the maths of that.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.820
So these are the two waves
we've added together.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.790
The only difference
between them is this sign.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.060
So we can take out the
other things as factors.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.500
And so these are the two terms
with the sign difference.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:29.020
So minus i something plus e to
the i something gives cosine.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.420
And so that is our final answer.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:36.670
What you see, the intensity
is the modulus square of this.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.120
These are all phase terms so
we don't worry about them.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.730
And I guess in this
expression here

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:45.130
we don't worry about any of
these other things either,

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:46.270
these constants.

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:51.860
The only thing that's
important is this term here.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.480
And we seem to have kept the 4.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.480
2 squared.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.790
I guess-- yeah.

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:01.730
Why have we kept that?

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:02.230
Anyway.

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:03.820
4 cos squared something.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.340
And then we say that
cos squared of something

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:11.090
is equal to 1 plus cos 2 theta.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:15.400
And so therefore our
final result, then, this

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.680
is then our expression.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.750
Very similar to what we
had before, of course,

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.660
for the interferometry.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:28.360
A background with a cosine
fringes on top of it.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.130
So here it is.

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:33.100
It's very similar to
what we had before.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.250
The m here is 1.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.670
And that of course is
just like with the case

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:43.030
of the interferometer
that we described before.

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:45.040
You remember we
got m equals 1 when

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.950
the strength of the object
beam and the reference beam

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:49.480
were equal.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.300
So in this case they're
equal, aren't they,

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.450
because the two slits
in the screen are equal.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:01.510
If you made those two slightly
different widths or something,

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:04.030
then that would not be true.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.580
Then you might end up with
something which didn't

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.240
have this visibility of 1.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.890
So that's the first example.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:18.780
So that one really
was showing how

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.720
interferometry and diffraction
are really the same.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.490
Now we're going to go on to
some more about diffraction

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:30.770
and introduce the idea
of a transparency.

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:34.110
So all we're doing here
is we're introducing

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:37.350
the concept of a
transparency that

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:44.310
can change the magnitude
and phase of a wave

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.560
by transmitting through it.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:53.410
And so this shows
here our transparency.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:58.650
And you can see here
it shows that the--

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:00.885
I don't know what this
color, whether it means--

01:13:00.885 --> 01:13:04.260
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:09.160
COLIN SHEPPARD: So this means
the absorption of the screen.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.400
But it might, I guess,
also change the phrase.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.980
It might have some
refractive index as well.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.990
Yeah.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:18.400
And it changes in
thickness as well.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.240
So you have to
work out, just like

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.730
before, the optical
path as the light

01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.350
goes through this structure.

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.540
And it might change
both the amplitude

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.470
and the phase of the light.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:37.350
So we can think of
this thin transparency

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:43.470
as just having a multiplying
effect if it's thin enough.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:49.620
So you can use your
Huygens' type principle

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.830
to say that when the light
has gone through there,

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:58.290
it produces some
wavefront on the far side.

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:01.590
So the assumptions-- the
thickness I've just said.

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:05.460
Also, the features
on the transparency--

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.760
what's that mean?

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.620
What's that mean?

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.607
The features on the transparency
are smaller than lambda.

01:14:11.607 --> 01:14:12.940
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.023
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah, right.

01:14:14.023 --> 01:14:14.600
OK.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.683
That's why I was confused.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:23.390
So this transparency can
change the attenuation.

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:26.720
So the black bits are
going to absorb the light.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.600
But it could also
change the phase.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.400
So phase delay.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.160
And both of these
are going to be--

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.610
both of these effects are going
to be dependent on the material

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:41.930
properties of this transparency,
of course, and also

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:43.310
its thickness.

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:48.540
And as it points out
here, in some cases,

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.620
you might be able to think
of these quantities--

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.590
the attenuation and
the phase delay--

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:58.010
as being binary quantities.

01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.380
They might only have
two different values.

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.040
For example, you might
have black and white,

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.930
or they might be gray scale-type
continuously varying-type

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:11.550
quantities.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.740
And then the phase also
you can think of that--

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.820
maybe it's continuously
varying phase change,

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.880
or it might have
just two values,

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.910
binary values, or it might even
have multiple values maybe,

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:29.870
say eight values.

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:35.570
You can code-- people often
use transparencies like this

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:42.740
to code binary numbers
up to some basis of eight

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:45.970
or something like that.

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:51.970
So if these assumptions
are true, then

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:57.310
according to Huygens' principle
the propagation through this,

01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:02.530
all it's going to do
basically is change the--

01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:04.670
this is going to change to this.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.430
This is going to change to this.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.670
And you're not going
to get this affecting

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:14.410
this very much if this
assumption of this thickness

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:20.340
being very thin is valid,
in which case all it does--

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.180
all this transparency does--

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:28.000
is multiplies the field
going in by the transmission

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.250
of the grating to give
the amplitude of the wave

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:34.360
as it comes out.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.010
So g minus is the wave-- is the
amplitude on the way in. g plus

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:43.000
is the amplitude of the
wave on the way out.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.240
And this transmittances,
we call this

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.210
the amplitude transmittance
of the grating.

01:16:49.210 --> 01:16:52.310
And you see it's a
function of position.

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:58.300
And as we just described, it can
be broken up into an absorption

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.830
term and a phase term.

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:05.640
And as we just said, those
two might either be--

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.340
they could be binary or they
could be continuously variable.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.420
Yes.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:19.180
So this is saying how--

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.650
you can think of
it as being very

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:24.890
similar to the Young's
interferometer, the two slit

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.770
expert experiment.

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:37.220
But now you can see
here we're thinking

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.470
of it as being many beams.

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:42.230
So you're breaking
this up into not just

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:45.670
two beams but many beams.

01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:48.440
And each of these is
going to propagate.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.890
But I'm not quite sure what
this is trying to show.

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:56.690
Yeah.

01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:57.190
OK.

01:17:57.190 --> 01:17:59.640
So it's pretty well
what I said before.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.400
So if this thing is thin
enough, then this point

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.680
here is only going to be
affected by this one and not

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.660
by the others.

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.010
So then you will get this
simple multiplicative

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:14.925
sort of relationship.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:24.080
So you can think of diffraction
then as being like interference

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.430
with many, many beams.

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:36.510
Yeah.

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:38.090
So this is saying,
just like we said

01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:44.090
before, we are describing
this interference

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:45.740
of these many, many beams now.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:52.610
When we did the Young's
experiment, each of the slits

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:54.560
was described by
a delta function

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.050
at a particular position.

01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:59.510
And now we're saying
that in general, we

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:04.970
can think of this as not being
just two slits but an integral

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:09.680
over many, many apertures--

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.890
very small apertures--
placed at these points x1 y1.

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:18.860
Sorry, placed at the
points xy, I guess.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.450
And then we're integrating
over all those points in order

01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:28.880
to get the total effect of
all those spherical waves.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.250
This is now we're
saying that g--

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:39.140
so this is g minus after the--

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.980
it's just saying that g--

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:46.807
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:46.807 --> 01:19:48.890
COLIN SHEPPARD: This is
just the shifting theorem.

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.040
And now we're going to
state that in there, are we?

01:19:51.040 --> 01:20:01.175
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:01.175 --> 01:20:02.050
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:05.185
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:05.185 --> 01:20:06.060
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:06.430
Yeah.

01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.980
OK.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.290
Yeah.

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:07.780
Yeah.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:08.280
Yeah.

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:23.180
So this is what goes in then.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:29.690
So this is our single point
on the wavefront going in.

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:33.710
And this gives rise to
a wave that comes out,

01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:37.100
a spherical wave that comes
out, which is of this form.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.950
It's the same as this
multiplied by the transmission

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:41.450
of the source.

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:46.312
And then this then radiates
like a spherical wave.

01:20:46.312 --> 01:20:48.770
And then you're going to get
some distribution of amplitude

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:52.040
on this observation plane,
which is going to be exactly

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.120
the same as we had before.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.360
And we've got this--

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.950
again, we've got
this parabolic phase

01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:03.600
function that comes from
the Fresnel approximation.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.920
So it assumes that x dashed y
dashed are much smaller than z.

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:16.320
So that's for a single point.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.610
And now we do-- now we
integrate over all of these.

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:22.790
And the final result
for the amplitude

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:26.590
we'll see on the screen is
given by this expression then.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.090
So this is the
incident wave, this

01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:31.760
is the transmission
of the screen,

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.210
and this is the
bit that describes

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:38.420
the propagation of
the spherical waves

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.600
according to the
Fresnel approximation.

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.760
So yeah.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.170
So this result is known as the
Fresnel diffraction integral,

01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:53.090
or simply the Fresnel integral.

01:21:53.090 --> 01:22:00.850
And so I mentioned earlier that
this approximation, replacing

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:02.690
the square root by
the squared terms,

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:05.000
is called the Fresnel
approximation.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.260
So all of these--

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.300
Fresnel gets the name
of all of these things.

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:15.990
Yeah.

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:20.170
This is just pointing out that
this expression we've just

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:24.010
written down, the form
of this is exactly

01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:27.620
the form of a convolution.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:33.400
And so that's a very
important result.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.800
A convolution, of course, means
it's space invariant, doesn't

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.300
it?

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.350
It means that you
can write this--

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:45.100
it's what goes in convolved
with something which is

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.140
independent of the coordinates.

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.530
And so if you think of
this as a convolution,

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:56.080
the thing you have to
convolve with is this thing.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.900
So you can think of
this as being like--

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.640
well, it's called
the point spread

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.260
function or the amplitude
point spread function.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:12.310
So if you put in some amplitude
and convolve it with this,

01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:13.720
then you'll get something out.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.560
So this is explaining
what I just said.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.610
So this is the sort
of behavior that you

01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:38.410
think of when you're looking
at a mechanical or electrical

01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:38.980
systems.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.910
You can think of a system
of being like a black box,

01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:45.490
or in this case, a blue box.

01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:49.420
And something goes in
and something comes out.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:53.650
And we don't have to worry
too much about what's in here.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:56.920
But you can express what goes
in, of course, either in terms

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.540
of some sort of impulse
response function,

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:04.150
or as we'll come to
in later lectures,

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:08.390
as some sort of transfer
function-type behavior.

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:11.650
But at the moment, we're
doing in the spatial domain.

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:17.120
So if we convolve this with
this point spread function,

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.630
then we'll get this
output, like this.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:30.970
Now we go on to do
some examples of this.

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:34.450
And this is probably the
most important example--

01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.250
comes up all the time--

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:41.660
because lots of optical
components are circular.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:47.240
So lenses and so on, very often
they've got this circular form.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.980
And so this comes up
time and time again.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:56.890
And so all we've got to
do now then is we put in--

01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:02.570
we say that our amplitude
after the light's gone

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:09.200
through this circular aperture
is 1 inside the circle

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.845
and 0 outside the circle.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.960
And so that Fresnel
diffraction integral

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.140
that we have to work out
for this circular aperture

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.150
is just 1 inside and 0 outside.

01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:28.360
So it's just-- you
just have to do

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.430
the integral over the inside.

01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:34.390
So this is just over
the values of x and y

01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.820
that are inside the
bright part here.

01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:43.560
Now, so unfortunately, that
integral is a bit hard to do.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.670
So we're not going to do it
at the moment in general.

01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:52.710
But we will do a very simple
example, a special case

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:55.510
of what happens along the axis.

01:25:55.510 --> 01:26:03.410
So if we put x and y
both zero, now we get--

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:07.670
we put x dashed equals
0, y dashed equals 0.

01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:10.560
The integral comes down to this.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.450
And now that is an
integral we can do.

01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:16.625
And it's an integral that
probably a lot of you

01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:18.410
have come across before.

01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:22.740
The way to solve that is to
go into polar coordinates.

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:27.390
And so if you change
into polar coordinates,

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:29.730
you've got a theta and a phi--

01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:33.030
a theta and a rho part.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:36.230
The theta part is just an
integral of a constant,

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.640
so that just becomes 2 pi.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.760
And the integral of this
other thing you can now do.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.310
Integral of rho e to
the i rho squared over

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:49.400
something you can do
because the rho outside

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.550
is the differential
of the bit inside.

01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:58.270
So to actually do
that properly, you

01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:01.310
can make a substitution then.

01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:04.910
Make a substitution that
xi is equal to this thing

01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:06.740
inside here.

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.980
And after you've made
that substitution,

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:14.690
you now just get integral
of e to the i xi.

01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:20.690
So that's something
you can just do.

01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.520
And you get an answer.

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:35.130
Yeah.

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:36.660
Notice that you get--

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.490
so this final result
here, this term

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:45.510
here is just the phase
term as a function of z.

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:49.320
So that's just what you would
get if it was just a wave

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.570
moving in free space.

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:54.210
And then these other
two terms, notice,

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:55.920
they're exactly the same form.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.300
This is an e to the i
something, and this is a sine

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.410
of exactly the same thing.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.920
So that's what we get.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.470
As I say, if you
go back to this,

01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:15.360
if you wanted to do
this integral here,

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.670
it's a bit more complicated.

01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:20.870
And so we're not going
to do that at the moment.

01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:25.488
But I guess eventually we
have to do something about it.

01:28:25.488 --> 01:28:28.103
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:28.103 --> 01:28:29.020
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right.

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:33.520
So if we look at this
amplitude along the axis,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.750
then, you can see it's got this
sinusoidal sort of behavior.

01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:40.840
If you looked at the
intensity, this would just go,

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.850
and you just get sine
squared of something.

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:47.350
Sine squared as a function
of a constant over z.

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:50.620
So as it points out
here, then, it's

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.820
going to have peaks
and nulls, maxima

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.650
and minima, corresponding to
these particular values of z.

01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:04.210
So you'll get a
sinusoidal variation

01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:08.140
in amplitude along the axis.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.465
The other thing
to note is that--

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.660
where's it gone?

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.450
Yeah.

01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:26.790
Notice that this z and
this z canceled out.

01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:32.700
This z here appeared when
we made this substitution.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.960
And so these z's finally cancel.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.940
And so the final result
has got no z in it.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.570
Sorry, no z in the
modulus part term.

01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:48.450
So you've got this
series of fringes

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:54.060
which are of constant
amplitude however

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:56.340
far away from this
aperture you go,

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.860
which might seem
rather surprising.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.280
You might think that as you
got closer to the aperture,

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.540
it would get
brighter, might you?

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.800
But it doesn't, it seems.

01:30:10.688 --> 01:30:13.230
I'm just trying to think quickly
why that should be the case.

01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:18.610
But I'm sure it is true.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.950
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Notice
also the pi over 2 phase shift

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:28.440
has disappeared.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.415
It got eaten up by the sine.

01:30:30.415 --> 01:30:31.290
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:31.800
That's true.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.130
Sorry.

01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:33.040
I didn't mention that.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:33.460
Yeah.

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:33.960
OK.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.710
So when you put in the limits
of the integration, then

01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:39.340
you've got this minus this.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.550
And this we replaced by sine.

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:45.580
But of course we need to get
an extra i to get the sine.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.080
Yeah.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.260
So the pi over 2 phase
shift is also gone.

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:52.620
The other thing that perhaps
is worth mentioning also

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:56.760
is that when we got down
to this integral of course,

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.740
this is just the
Fourier transform of 1,

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.860
isn't it, within this region.

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:05.710
It's the Fourier transform
of a rect function.

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:10.780
And even if we looked at
more complicated example,

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.290
if you add this circular
symmetry, whatever

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:19.500
this amplitude transmittance
of this aperture had been,

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.620
all we'd have to do is to
do the Fourier transform

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:26.400
of that amplitude
transmittances of that aperture

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.810
as a function of
this coordinate xi.

01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:34.320
So that's a sort of trick
you can use to calculate

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.600
these things easily sometimes.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.630
I think we're here
for the movies now.

01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:44.130
So MATLAB has calculated
these things for us.

01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:46.740
And when I press the
button, it will go.

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.230
But I'm not going to press
it until you're ready, just

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.010
in case it's very quick.

01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:54.150
So this is a big aperture.

01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:56.700
So what you'll see
is how the wave

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.640
propagates from that aperture.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.720
This is actually
quite a big aperture.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.230
So you don't expect to see a
lot of diffraction in this case.

01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:08.220
When we come to this one,
this is a small aperture.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.920
And as we said before, the
smaller it is to start,

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.110
the more it's going to spread.

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:16.440
So you're going to see a
lot more effect on that one.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.900
And so you have to
look quite closely

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.630
to see what happens
as it propagates.

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:26.900
So this is a radius
of 40 lambda.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.120
Now you can see some sort
of fringes appearing,

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:35.230
and it becomes like a bright
halo around the edges.

01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:36.760
And if you look
very closely, you'll

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.700
see quite a lot of
fine structure on this.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:47.870
And then the small one,
this is 10 wavelengths.

01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:50.530
So this one changes
a lot quicker.

01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:53.598
You see it's doing
quite drastic things.

01:32:53.598 --> 01:32:55.390
By the time it gets to
the end, you've even

01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:56.820
got a black spot in the center.

01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:05.730
The fact that, of course--

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.650
we said before that the
smaller the aperture,

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.770
the more it spreads, but
also the quicker it spreads.

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.780
So you can see that
actually this one

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:19.000
has got a lot further
in the development

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.920
of the pattern than this one.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.820
This one still looks roughly
similar to what it started as.

01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.024
This one is looking
very, very different.

01:33:35.217 --> 01:33:36.550
It calls this the blinking spot.

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.550
I've never heard of it
called the blinking spot.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:39.270
But anyway.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.550
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.940
COLIN SHEPPARD: Well.

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:44.420
Yeah.

01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.212
I'm not even sure--

01:33:45.212 --> 01:33:48.110
I always think of
the Poisson spot

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:51.770
as being what you get
from an opaque object,

01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:54.980
rather than for--

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.512
but maybe that's the Arago spot.

01:33:57.512 --> 01:33:58.970
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
But Binet says

01:33:58.970 --> 01:34:00.785
the two are the same, right?

01:34:00.785 --> 01:34:01.660
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.200
Yeah.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.770
Yeah.

01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:04.270
OK.

01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:07.140
So now the rectangular aperture.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:11.980
The rectangular aperture--
actually it turns out you

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.810
can't get a simple
expression for what

01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:17.500
happens along the axis
of the rectangular case,

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.660
unlike the circular case.

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.380
So that's probably why
George hasn't done it.

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.980
And so you can get expressions
in terms of Fresnel integrals

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:29.440
for everywhere, in
fact, for this case.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.090
So the square case, then.

01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:32.530
Let's see what that does.

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:33.970
The big square.

01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:38.790
Again, you can see-- you can
see some sort of fringes.

01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:41.380
And by the time it's
got to the end here,

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:45.460
you can see bright lines around
the edges, and also bright

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:48.480
spots in the four corners.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.130
And then if we look
at the small square,

01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:56.470
again, it's changing
more quickly.

01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:59.710
And you'll notice that
we've developed by then--

01:34:59.710 --> 01:35:03.010
we've got quite strong sort
of streaking along these two

01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:04.900
axes here.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.140
And in fact, you see
this final pattern there

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:18.250
that is the diffraction
pattern of the square aperture.

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:19.880
What does it say?

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.107
Well, we haven't done Fraunhofer
diffraction yet, have we?

01:35:25.107 --> 01:35:26.440
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.600
COLIN SHEPPARD: This is
introduction to it. yeah.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.860
This is an example of
Fraunhofer diffraction then.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.810
If you're a long way
away, you get what's

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:36.460
called Fraunhofer diffraction.

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.740
This is what it looks like.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.920
And as we're going
to show later,

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:45.190
this is very simply
related to the Fourier

01:35:45.190 --> 01:35:48.490
transform of the
structure, the object

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:51.260
that we're going to look at.

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:51.810
OK.

01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:52.310
Yeah.

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:57.440
So this case here, eventually
this one would look like this.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.760
But we haven't gone
anywhere near far enough

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.650
for it to look like that.

01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:04.720
But eventually it
would get like that.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.710
The distance have to go depends
on how big the aperture is.

01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:15.360
End of show.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.170
Here, we will talk
about in the calculation

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.300
of angular momentum.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.430
People often forget
that angular momentum

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.830
can be calculated
for any object,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.310
even for an object
that's traveling

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.390
in a straight line and
not rotating at all.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.340
For example, here
I have an object

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.460
with mass m moving at a
speed v along a street line.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.320
Another important
thing to keep in mind

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.720
is that angular momentum does
not have a definite value.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.650
It depends on the choice of
origin, which is arbitrary,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.140
although some choices
are easier to calculate

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.510
or more useful than others.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.210
Here, I will choose this
completely random point

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.890
to be my origin.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.730
Notice that it can be
any point in space.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
Angular momentum is
a lot like torque.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.030
They both involve a cross
product of a distance vector

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.740
with another vector.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.670
For angular momentum, it's
the distance vector r,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.510
the vector from the
origin to the object,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.200
cross p, the momentum
of the object, or mv.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.510
Once again, we can
write the magnitude

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.860
of this cross-product as
r times mv times the size

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.260
of the theta between the two.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.300
But it's often more
helpful to think

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.000
about this as r times
sine theta times mv.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.539
In other words, the r sine
theta is the component

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.039
of the position vector that's
perpendicular to the direction

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.706
of the momentum.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.960
Let's practice with
a few other examples.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.450
If I have a ball moving up and
I have my origin at the side,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060
then this is the
perpendicular distance.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.223
So the angular momentum is
r perpendicular times mv.

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.070
A reference point that's
the same horizontal distance

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.640
away from the object will see
the same angular momentum.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.610
Notice that in this case,
the angular momentum is not

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.922
changing as the ball moves,
because the perpendicular

00:01:57.922 --> 00:01:59.380
distance is not
changing with time.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.080
In this case, if the ball
is moving at an angle,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.780
we again, have to
take the perpendicular

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.800
component of the position vector
to find the angular momentum.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.830
This second reference point is
now a different distance away.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.490
So the angular
momentum is larger.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.600
Now, let's talk about the
sign of angular momentum.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.970
You can calculate the
sine of a cross product

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.070
with the right hand rule.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.650
Make sure your vectors
are tail to tail when

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.390
you compare the directions.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.630
So in this case, we have that
r cross v points into the page.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.400
In the case of circular
motion, r and v

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.079
are always perpendicular.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.020
So we can just multiply
the magnitudes together.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.950
And the sine tells us which way
we're going around the circle.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.160
If we consider out of
the page to be positive

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.840
and the angular
momentum is positive,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.130
then the object is
circulating counter-clockwise.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.140
If the angular
momentum is negative,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.220
the object is
circulating clockwise.

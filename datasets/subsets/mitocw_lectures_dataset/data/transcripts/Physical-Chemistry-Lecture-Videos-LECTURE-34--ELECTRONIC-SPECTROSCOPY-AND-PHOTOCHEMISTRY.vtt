00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:23.520
PROFESSOR ROBERT
FIELD: So last time we

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.030
talked about intermolecular
interactions.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.250
Intermolecular.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
It's complicated enough talking
about individual molecules,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
what molecules can
do, but we could also

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.830
talk about interactions
between molecules,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.220
and we can use perturbation
theory, and what we discover

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.540
is something universal about
all pairs of molecules.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.000
Molecules which
don't have any reason

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.450
to interact with each other,
like being charged or even

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.700
having dipole moments, and we
discover that all molecules

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.020
are attracted to each other.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.630
And we know the force law, we
know how everything scales,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.950
and we also know that we
can look at molecules,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.350
and say this molecule
is going to be

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.160
a good molecule for
intermolecular interactions

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.170
because either it has a lot
of low-lying transitions,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.260
or they have very
strong transitions.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.300
And so you can compare different
atoms or different molecules.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.760
And one of the
important messages

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.500
is that really big
molecules are really sticky.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
They want to attract
each other because they

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.950
have a lot of vibrations,
and each vibrational node

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.130
can act as a dipole in this
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.360
whether it's induced
dipole-induced dipole

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.090
or whatever.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.669
So it's one of
these things where

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.400
something from one
half of your brain

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.810
is able to explain something
from the other half,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.900
and that's really wonderful, and
we're always aiming for that.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.769
Now, today we're talking
about photochemistry.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.340
And this is an enormous topic.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.870
And I would say that there are
vastly more physical chemists

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.980
and biophysical chemists
working on photochemistry

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.300
than on spectroscopy.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.260
So what happens when a molecule
gets excited by a photon?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.370
Does it just fluoresce or
does it do interesting stuff?

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.020
And there's a lot of really
beautiful semi-empirical theory

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.140
that enables you to estimate
the rates of everything

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.510
that a molecule can do, and the
uses for what these things do.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.850
But in order to put
this in perspective,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.690
I have to do a little bit of
review of the different kinds

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.280
of spectroscopy--

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.140
rotation, rotation-vibration,
rotation-vibration-electronic

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.180
in order to get
the energy scales

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.138
and to describe the actors in
this problem of photochemistry.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.030
There's two sets
of notes, what I'm

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.590
going to be working from, which
is because I'm a small molecule

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.770
person, bottom-up,
and I'm trying

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.160
to take what I know
and I've taught you

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.950
about small molecules,
and extend it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.210
to regions of
incredible complexity,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.290
but using most of
the same concepts.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.550
And Troy's notes,
which are top-down,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.990
and he's basically
interested in photochemistry,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.230
and condensed phases,
and big molecules.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.180
And I'm afraid to go
to condensed phases

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.269
and big molecules, but
the two shall meet,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.600
and many of the topics
will be understandable

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.640
with both approaches.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.690
OK, so let's just
set the framework.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:40.330
We have three kinds of
spectra, and the typical energy

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.700
associated with that
is one wave number.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.170
And we have rotation-vibration,
and the typical energy scale

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.550
is 1,000 wave numbers.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.310
And then there is the
rotation-vibration-electronic,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.380
and that's, going to say
20,000 wave numbers and higher.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.900
Now, this is peanuts compared to
the strength of molecular bonds

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.800
and interactions
between molecules,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.220
but this is big news
because now the photon

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.230
that excites the molecule is
sort of acting like a reagent.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.960
This energy, it goes
up as far as you want.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.230
These energies are comparable to
the energies of chemical bonds,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.520
and the electronically
excited molecules

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.360
can do chemistry that the
rotational or vibrationally

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.110
excited molecules can't do.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.860
That's why it's so
interesting, and that's

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.364
why it's so complicated.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:17.476
OK, now, what can an
excited molecule do?

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.730
Well, maybe I should ask you.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.480
Yes?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.260
AUDIENCE: Rearrange.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.025
PROFESSOR ROBERT FIELD: OK, so
we can call it isomerization.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.900
Anything else?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.180
AUDIENCE: Fragmentation.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.660
PROFESSOR ROBERT
FIELD: I'm sorry?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.798
AUDIENCE: Fragmentation.

00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:49.290
PROFESSOR ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.530
AUDIENCE: It can relax.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.334
PROFESSOR ROBERT FIELD: By?

00:06:52.334 --> 00:06:53.500
AUDIENCE: Emitting a photon.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.445
PROFESSOR ROBERT FIELD:
Yes, fluorescence.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.110
That's what we do.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.540
There's lots of
things that can happen

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.610
and the kinds of
things that can happen

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.360
depends on what kind of
exaltation we've produced,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.300
but the big photons
are going to produce

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.845
really complicated stuff.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:28.140
Now, one framework we can talk
about is what is the rate of--

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.910
I can't imagine
what I wrote there.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.260
So this is the
total rate, and it

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:50.470
can be composed of
the radiative decay

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:56.020
and the non-radiative decay.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.782
Now, there's a size scale here.

00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:01.990
Oh, I know what I wrote here.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.750
That's measured.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.050
So if you had a system and you
measured the exponential decay

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.300
of the population
in that system,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.880
that's composed of the radiative
part and everything else,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.990
and the radiative
part corresponds

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.950
to lifetimes no shorter
than 10 nanoseconds.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:34.320
There is absolutely no way
that molecules or atoms can

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.980
fluoresce at a rate much
faster than one over 10

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:48.750
to the minus eight seconds,
and then there's other stuff.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.500
And so when the other stuff,
the non-radiative decay

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.950
is fast compared to the
fastest the molecule

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.830
could decay by
emitting a photon,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.300
then we're getting
into something

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.340
complicated and interesting.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.610
When the molecule just
radiates a photon,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.180
and this stuff is very
small, well, that's nice,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.450
but it doesn't tell us
very much except what

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.990
is the radiative lifetime of
the particular excited state.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.300
So there's various
kinds of de-excitation,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:31.750
and there's collisional,
and there's--

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.400
well, we can call
it collision-free.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.550
Now, remember, if there's no
collision, energy is conserved.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.280
We have a Hamiltonian.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.670
The expectation of the
Hamiltonian for an isolated

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.530
system is not time dependent.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:54.830
So we have energy conservation,
yet in the absence of--

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.730
collisions are what
change the energy.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.910
We remove energy
from the system.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.260
We can have an incredibly
complicated range of processes

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:11.350
which are collision-free, and
these collision-free processes

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.190
have the signature of
the molecule all over it.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.670
They are telling you something
about what the molecule thinks

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.080
it can do and does, whereas
the collisional stuff is

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.220
purely statistical.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:41.853
So the collisional
processes, we can say--

00:10:41.853 --> 00:10:45.100
we can estimate
how fast they are.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.220
And first of all,
there is this number

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.270
that many physical chemists
carry in their head,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.420
especially if we work
in the gas phase.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.750
A collisional rate is on the
order of 10 megahertz per torr.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.740
Now, I'm an old guy.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.940
I do two torr instead
of bar or millibar,

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.760
but a torr and a millibar
are about the same thing.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.100
And at atmospheric
pressure, that corresponds

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:32.790
to 10 gigahertz per atmosphere,
and so that means 10

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.275
to the minus 10 seconds.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.910
So the collisional rates can be
competing with radiative rates

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.020
at atmospheric pressure.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.170
Or in condensed phase,
they really can compete.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.860
But this number, 10
megahertz per torr,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.730
is a good number to carry
around for estimating

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.620
the frequency of collisions.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.960
Now, there are different
kinds of collisions.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:23.110
And one collision
with this sort of rate

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:30.420
is all it takes
to relax rotation,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:38.821
and about 1,000 solutions are
required to relax vibration.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.960
And now, it's very
hard to estimate

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:57.750
what it takes to relax
electronic excitation

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.830
because the electronic
excitation is so big,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.310
there's so many different
things that can happen.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.870
And so you could say, well,
if nothing really chemical

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.930
happened, it would take
about a million collisions

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:18.060
to relax electronic, but there
are so many other things.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.520
I don't want to
put a number here

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.410
because this is really the
interesting and complicated

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:23.910
stuff.

00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:27.690
OK.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.860
In particular, suppose you
have an electronically excited

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.550
molecule, and it collides
with an unexcited molecule,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.850
and you end up doing A plus
BCD or all sorts of things.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.210
That's chemistry, right?

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.990
But this wouldn't happen
if this star wasn't there.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.580
And there's a tremendous
complexity to chemistry.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.470
That's why we have--

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.690
it's a BSD subject.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.230
It's a major area of
science, and so we're

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.050
engaging with
chemistry when we start

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.750
talking about electronically
excited atoms,

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.600
and vibration and
rotation excitation

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.140
is largely irrelevant
to chemistry.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.080
it's small potatoes.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.690
You can see chemical effects
by rotation and vibrational

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.200
excitation, but that's
for the purists like me.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:36.780
OK, now collision-free effects
are initially surprising.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.370
We can have several, and
we've got some of those

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.370
from the initial
discussion, but I'm

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.170
going to just list them again.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:55.020
We can have the molecule
breaks, and that could

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.930
be dissociation or ionization.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.340
This is something
that all molecules

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.720
do if you excite them enough.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:13.220
They either fall apart into
smaller molecules or ionize.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.190
There's nothing
surprising there.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:20.820
But then there's the
unexpected processes,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.600
or at least they used
to be unexpected.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.099
When I was a graduate
student, there

00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:30.310
was still a lot of
confusion about what happens

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.770
in the absence of collisions.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.440
And there are several
names for them.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.750
IVR-- intramolecular
vibrational redistribution.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.060
This process, which
you understand

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.320
from perturbation theory--

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.020
I talked about this
early in the semester.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:58.660
This put closed to
the idea of vibration

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.740
or mode-specific chemistry
by putting an excitation

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.980
into a molecule-- a high
vibrational excitation

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.170
into a particular molecule,
activate a bond to chemistry.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.720
IVR is always faster
than chemistry.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.420
Or faster than collisions until
you get to the condensed phase.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.280
IVR, that's one.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.820
There was so much confusion
about IVR in the old days

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.830
that people didn't even
know what it meant.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.600
It just meant I don't
understand what's going on.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.080
But it is intramolecular
vibrational redistribution.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.150
Then there's another process
called internal conversion,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.980
and another process called
intersystem crossing.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.390
So IVR is something that
happens in one electronic state,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.740
internal conversion
involves relaxation

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.920
into high vibrational
levels of a lower

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.300
electronic state
of the same spin,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.349
and intersystem
crossing is a relaxation

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:17.099
into a high vibrational levels
of another electronic state

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.119
with a different spin.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.430
These are really two
sides of the same coin,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:29.270
except that they depend on
different molecular properties,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.220
and one can make
generalizations that

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.725
are different for IC and ISC.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.240
So for a small molecule, we've
looked at this before, but--

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:01.520
we can excite directly
to an excited state,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.480
and that's direct association
that comes like this,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.750
and there's all sorts of
really neat things you can do,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.810
where you can calculate
the Franck-Condon factors

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.100
or the vibrational intensities
for the different energies,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:21.310
here, by knowing that you have--

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.880
you can calculate the wave
function for the continuum,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.280
and you know you
have a big lobe here,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.840
and as it gets
faster and faster,

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.290
the lobes get smaller, and
smaller, and closer, and closer

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.130
together.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.260
And there's a thing called
the reflection principle

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.680
that describes the
rate of excitation

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.270
to a repulsive state.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.070
And by looking at
the spectrum, you

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.480
can learn the slope and
position of this state.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.260
OK, there's also suppose
you have a level here

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.170
of this excited state.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.620
Well, that excited state has
access to this crossing point,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.810
and so that can
free-disassociate.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.970
So there's direct and
free-dissociation.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.100
I like this stuff
too because if I

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.980
know the rate of
free-disassociation,

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.200
and what happens with
free disassociation

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.050
is you have a spectrum
where you measure

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.690
several vibrational
levels in this state,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.650
and the vibrational
lifetimes of these states

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.260
are more or less the
same, and all of a sudden

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.380
the lifetime decreases.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.860
Or all of a sudden the spectrum
goes from being sharp to broad.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.200
Or the fluorescence decreases.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.200
The intensity decreases
because the quantum yield

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.160
or the fluorescence
quantum yield

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:02.930
is one over tau radiated over
one over tau radiated plus one

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.080
over tau non-radiated.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.320
And the pre-disassociation
rates can be much faster

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.700
than the radiative rates.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.460
So this fluorescence
quantum yield goes down.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.120
But the neat thing
is that you generally

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.100
know what the radiative
component of the decay is,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.570
and so by measuring what
the actual fluorescence

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.120
quantum yield or the
decrease in intensity,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.020
you learn something about
the non-radiative decay.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:42.900
OK, I've also taught
you we can also ionize.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.615
And we can have
direct ionization,

00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:47.310
and it looks sort
of like this, or we

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.040
can have what's
called auto-ionization

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.120
where somehow, the molecule
is able to convert rotation

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.720
and vibration of the
core, and transfer it

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.460
into the electronic excitation,
and the electron is free.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.030
So before you're actually
accessing directly,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.780
an ionization continue, you
can have this other process.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.690
These are things that I've
studied for my whole career,

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.710
and I know about it, and
I love to talk about them,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.630
and we're not going
to talk about them.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.720
OK, I also told you
about quantum beats.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.510
So suppose we have a bright
state and a dark state.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.190
In other words, we have
two states, one of which

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.520
has an allowed transition
with the ground state,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.070
and one has a
forbidden transition

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.030
with the ground state.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.420
But these are zero
order states, and they

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:51.240
can interact to make mixed
states because there's

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.100
some term in the Hamiltonian
connects the bright state

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.990
to the dark state.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.370
So what you do with a
short excitation pulse

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.440
is you make some
coherent superposition

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.620
of these bright and dark
states, which at t equals

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.600
zero is the bright state,
and you get quantum beats,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.540
and quantum beats
can look like this.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.790
They start out phased
up, and they go down

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.410
like that, and so we have
modulation of the fluorescence.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.020
Now, it doesn't have
to be 100% modulation.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.944
It could be something
really small,

00:22:32.944 --> 00:22:34.860
but it's always going
to be phased up if we're

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.690
looking at the bright state.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.470
So we understand quantum beats.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.190
Now, suppose instead of having
one bright state and one

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:55.155
dark state, light, dark, we have
a whole bunch of dark states.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:03.060
Well, in that case, if you make
this coherent superposition,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.660
you'll get many quantum
beats, but they'll all

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.070
have different frequencies, and
the quantum beats will dephase,

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:16.380
and it will look just like
the fluorescence decays

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:23.020
to zero faster than it's
supposed to be able to.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.800
The ceiling on decay
rate of one over 10

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.020
to the minus eight
or 10 to the eight

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.840
per second, that can be violated
by mixing of the bright state

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.700
into the dark state.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.370
So the ability of the molecule
to fluoresce goes away fast,

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.760
but the excitation
doesn't decay.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.200
What you've done is you've mixed
a bright state, a decaying zero

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.050
order state, with
states that don't decay,

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.500
and the average
lifetime is very long,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.420
but the experiment says the
lifetime is really short.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.180
Because what's happening
is not that the population

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.540
is decaying, but
the ability to decay

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.840
has been spread among
many eigenstates,

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.630
and so none of them
are very good at it.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.020
OK, so now you're
starting to get

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:30.030
the idea of how we can have
fast decay without collisions.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:39.600
And all of these three
processes, which I've hidden,

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.160
IVR, internal conversion,
intersystem crossing,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.810
are based on relaxation
of one kind of state

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.970
into many dark states.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.340
So nothing is happening
without collisions.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.860
Energy is conserved
without collisions,

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.890
but the signal
goes away, and it's

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:06.110
tempting to say that either
something magic has happened

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.320
and the molecule has
decayed, or you really

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.960
haven't gone to low
enough pressure,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.990
and there really are collisions.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:25.770
This was a very bitter
battle in the mid 1960s.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.010
There was one faculty member
who taught the quantum mechanics

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.050
course, very much like the one
I've been teaching for years,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.680
but he believed that
there was no such thing

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.780
as radiationless transitions.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:42.025
It's always that the
fluorescence was quenched,

00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:42.650
but he's wrong.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.920
In the absence of
collision, what decays?

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.990
What decays is the
ability to fluoresce

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.650
or the ability to
do other things

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.950
like absorb another photon
to some other excited state.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.190
You've produced the molecule
not just in one eigenstate,

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:38.140
but in a bunch of eigenstates,
and this bunch of eigenstates,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.290
since the initial
preparation, is

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.110
the bright state
that's in that bunch,

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.810
and there's a couple among them.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.860
What happens is
it's time dependent,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.700
and the evolution of this
coherent superposition state

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.140
is the key.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.160
Let's talk a little bit
about IVR some more.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.300
When we have 3n minus
six vibrational modes,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.470
there can be a very large
number of dark states.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:26.100
States that couldn't be
excited by whatever method

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.660
you use to excite them, whether
it be an ultraviolet photon,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.770
or a microwave--

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.370
anything.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.410
You have a bright
state and a whole bunch

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.725
of states that you are not
supposed to be able to excite,

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:42.960
an anharmonic
interactions among them.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.850
And we know some things.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.740
So if we have a
cubic interaction,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.620
where we have one normal mode.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.090
So this would be a term
in the Hamiltonian.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.520
And again, I lectured
on this before at a time

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.220
when it was probably
impossible to understand

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.120
the significance of this, but
you used perturbation theory

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.970
to say OK, what's happening when
you have an anharmonic coupling

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.210
term that couples
one mode to another?

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.410
And we know how do all
that sort of stuff.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:37.750
And the selection rules
for that are delta vi

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.140
equals plus and
minus one, delta vj

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.060
equals plus and
minus two and zero.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:51.200
We also know when we go
from the real coordinate

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:58.520
to the dimensionless coordinate,
we factor something out.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.540
And for each power of Q,
that thing that we factor out

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.315
is a factor of 100 smaller.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.320
We have cubic terms that
we have quartic terms,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.010
and the quartic terms are a
factor of roughly 100 smaller,

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.930
but there's more of them.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.550
And so there is an order
sorting thing, which

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:25.440
we can call delta capital
V, which is the sum from i

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:33.580
equals one to 3n minus six of
the absolute value of delta vi.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:44.560
So if the total change in number
of vibrational quanta is three,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.090
well, we have a cubic term.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.910
If it's four, it's quartic
term, and the quartic term

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.630
has a coefficient, a
factor of 100, roughly,

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.520
smaller than the cubic one,
but there's more possibilities.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.495
And so suppose we are going
to talk about benzene.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.310
Well, it has 30 nodes.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:24.310
And so we could imagine
delta v on the order o 30.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:37.260
Well, it's 10 to the 60 smaller
than the delta v of three,

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.600
except that there's a
lot more possibilities.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.820
So we have to think about how
big is the coupling matrix

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.580
element, and how many
states are being coupled?

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.270
And so there's a thing
that's really relevant

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.530
called the vibrational
density of states.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.080
So at a particular
excitation energy,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.750
you want to be able to know how
many vibrational states there

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.960
are because that, more
or less, tells you OK,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.590
we're going to have some
kind of statistical coupling.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:11.850
And if we know the density of
states and the average matrix

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.445
element, we could do a Fermi
golden rule of calculation,

00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:16.270
and we can predict
what's going to happen.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.710
Now, there are
ways of calculating

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:31.050
the density of states, which
are rigorous and beautiful,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.290
but there's also a very
simple minded way of doing it,

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.860
which I'm going to present here.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.625
So the vibrational
density of states.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:30.190
This is one of the most
primitive, crude estimates

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.610
of density of states, and
I'll explain how it works,

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.980
but I'll explain it
by going even cruder.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.850
And I also want to make
sure that I have it--

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.380
OK, this frequency
is in wave numbers,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.760
and this is in wave numbers.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.400
So we just changed
both quantities.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.410
This is OK, and
this will give me

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:05.920
the number of states
per wave number.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.620
OK, so let me do an
example for benzene.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:15.770
We have 30 modes, and
here's a big assumption,

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.810
which is completely wrong, but
it leads to an underestimate.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:25.840
Let us say that all of the
modes have the same frequency--

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.960
1000 wave numbers.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.610
That's a typical number for
a vibrational frequency,

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.690
but benzene has a
lot of modes that

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.660
have much lower
frequencies, and only a few

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.510
that have higher
frequency, and so

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.690
this is going to be a
gross underestimate.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:48.380
And now let's say we have the
vibrational energy divided

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:57.150
by Hc, and that that
is 10,000 wave number.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.470
So we have 10,000 wave numbers
of vibrational excitation

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.670
in benzene, and we
have all the modes

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.480
having the same frequency.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:17.929
So we need 10 quanta to make
10,000, and there's 30 choices.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.170
So we have 30 to the 10.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:31.300
So each quanta we pick,
we have 30 choices.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.530
And we have to do 10 of them,
and so it's 30 to the 10,

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:39.420
but now we have 10 factorial.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.560
We have to divide that by that
because the order of the 10

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.300
choices has to be corrected.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.870
OK, and so this number is
1.6 times 10 to the eighth.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.920
That's a big number.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.680
I'm used to talking about
states one at a time,

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.690
and it's very rare that I have
two states within one wave

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:14.930
number, and here we
have 10 of the eight.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.020
So let's go down in
energy a little bit.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:27.320
Let's say instead of
10,000, let's go to 3,000.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.870
And when we do the same
calculation for 3,000,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:38.190
we get 4,500 states instead
of 100 million states.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.060
So two messages.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:48.520
One is the number of
states is really large,

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.490
and it goes up
really, really fast.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.160
And this takes us into a
region of quantum mechanics

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.980
that we hadn't thought
about before because I'm

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.950
doing bottom-up, and
there is no place

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:07.195
in what I do for a million
states or even 100 states.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.177
OK.

00:36:14.177 --> 00:36:28.090
Now, let's talk about a
typical energy level diagram.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:33.070
This is the ground state, This
is the excited triplet state,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:36.460
which is almost always
the first excited state,

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.570
and then here is the
first excited sigma state.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:54.360
And so for small
polyphonic molecules,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.630
we have a very low
density of states here,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.670
a somewhat higher density of
vibrationally excited levels

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:06.530
of the triplet here, and a
very high density of states

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.460
from the ground state.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.670
So you normally look at
relatively low vibrational

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.190
levels, and there's nothing
much happening here,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.020
and maybe there's
some perturbations

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.280
by a triplet state.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.700
So we get local glitches
in the energy levels

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.790
and spectroscopic
properties, and the density

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.650
of high vibrational
level in a ground state

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.430
is so high that they might
as well not be there.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:40.050
But now when we talk about these
collisional processes of bigger

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:51.100
molecules, we want to
use Fermi's golden rule,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.070
and you've seen
Fermi's golden rule.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.250
It tells you the rate
of various processes.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.450
And so a rate, we
can call gamma.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:08.380
Two pi over h bar times the
vibrational density of states

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:18.760
times H bright, dark squared.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.160
So that's the
Fermi's golden rule

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:27.250
rewritten in terms to describe
radiationless processes.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:33.100
It's directly related to
the first way we saw it.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.370
And so we have the
vibrational density of states,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.490
which as you go up
in excitation energy,

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.170
increases really rapidly.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.590
You have the average
of the matrix

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:50.580
elements between the
coupled states, squared.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.570
This is going to go
down because remember

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.740
when I talked about
vibrational matrix elements,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.960
each additional
number in the change

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.530
in total vibrational quanta
causes this to go down

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:12.330
by roughly a factor of 100.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:16.320
We have a big increase here,
and a big decrease here,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.780
but this guy wins.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.620
You can show that.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:34.645
So now, we can draw sort
of a manifold of states.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:50.410
So what's happening is the
density of triplet states

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.690
is much higher than the
density of singlet states.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.290
And so if you were just
interested in IVR, well,

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.680
you'd look at that.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.010
But this is a much
faster process,

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.890
and this is enormously
faster because the energy

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:09.670
gap between s1 and t1 is much
smaller than in the energy

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.440
gap between s1 and s0.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:21.550
And so the s1-s0 interaction
is called internal conversion,

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:29.090
and that's usually way bigger
than the s1-t1 intersystem

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:33.910
crossing, but not always.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:44.990
The intersystem crossing is
due to spin orbit interactions.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:51.110
Spin orbit interactions are
predictable for each atom.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.960
Extending what you
got in five-eleven-one

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.080
and five-eleven-two, you can
predict what the spin orbit

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:03.950
interaction is, and it's related
to the amplitude of the wave

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.990
function at the nucleus.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.940
But anyway, what happens is
that carbon has a spin orbit

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.760
coupling constant
of 10 wave numbers,

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.420
and oxygen has one of
about 150 wave numbers.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.410
And since we're talking about
squared matrix elements,

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:26.480
oxygen is 225 times more
effective than carbon.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.220
And so if we have a couple of
oxygen atoms in the molecule--

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.310
or nitrogen atoms--

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.730
the spin orbit interactions
are much bigger,

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:44.100
and they can win over
internal conversion sometimes.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.560
Depends on what
the energy gap is.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.450
And now, molecules which have
strong electronic transitions

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:54.770
have chroma force.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.180
It's not the whole molecule.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.370
It's something about a
part of the molecule.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.790
And if you have a
strong transition

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:08.020
at relatively low energy, there
is always oxygen or nitrogen.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.345
And so the thing
that you're exciting

00:42:13.345 --> 00:42:17.410
is going to have a fast
intersystem crossing rate

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:26.470
because it involves
oxygen and nitrogen.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:31.060
But if you have just
a pure hydrocarbon,

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.700
intersystem crossing is
probably not so important,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.130
but internal conversion
is going to win.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:41.320
And for most
hydrocarbons, you can

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.040
have a nice, strong
absorption spectrum, but very

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.980
little fluorescence,
and that's mostly

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.031
because of internal conversion.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:06.870
But the crucial thing is the
energy gap s1-t1, or s1-s0

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:12.720
controlling the relative
importance of ISC versus IC.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.780
Now, you could also have
several different excited

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.890
states like s1 and
s2, and they could

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.110
be talking to each other
through a small gap

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.540
or to the ground state
by an even larger gap.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.740
There's all sorts of stuff.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.330
Yes?

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.820
AUDIENCE: The internal
conversion process, you're

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.310
going from the first
singlet excited state

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.430
to the lowest level
singlet ground state.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.025
Where does the energy
get redistributed to?

00:43:39.025 --> 00:43:40.650
PROFESSOR ROBERT
FIELD: It gets excited

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:44.780
into a vibrational excited
level of the ground state,

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.340
but the energy
hasn't gone anywhere.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:55.600
It's just now these guys
are not fluorescing,

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.560
and if there are
collisions, the collisions

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:06.660
can cause removal of
energy from the molecule.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.830
And since the vibrational
energy gaps are really small,

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.040
collisions start to be
very effective in cooling.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:21.370
But if you have a laser, and the
laser involves somehow exciting

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.302
the s1 state, and
the s1 state likes

00:44:25.302 --> 00:44:27.510
to fluoresce to high
vibrational levels of the ground

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:32.240
state because of
Franck-Condon, so it has gain,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.250
but there is often a t1
to t2 excitation, which

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:44.050
is in the region of the gain of
the laser, and it quenches it.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.630
And so diolasers, which are
a fantastic way of generating

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.270
tunable radiation,
are always worried

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.630
about quenching by
triplets, and you

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.520
have to do something
clever to quench

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.000
the triplets to remove that.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.630
So there's all sorts of stuff
about competing processes

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.920
that you can use it as insights.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:20.720
OK, we don't have much more
time, and the most important

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.300
topic, I'm not going
to talk about at all.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.760
So we can have isomerization,
and isomerization

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.570
takes many forms.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.150
I've spent the last
30 years looking

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.810
at isomerization in a really
simple polyatomic called

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.840
acetylene.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:51.650
And in the ground
state, you can isomerize

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.170
from high vibrational
levels of the ground state

00:45:54.170 --> 00:46:01.270
to another isomer
called [? venility, ?]

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.310
and this is a really
interesting problem.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:10.240
And in the excited state,
we have two conformers.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.680
The trans-bent conformer
and the cis-bent

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.410
conformer, and they're
separated by a barrier,

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.050
and we can understand
both of those processes.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.190
But the important thing is
if the molecule isomerizes,

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:28.220
its chemistry changes, and
so it will act differently.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.310
Now, there's all sorts of
kinds of isomerizations.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:36.570
This is a 1,2 hydrogen
shift, but there's also

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.020
intramolecular proton transfer.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.100
There's torsions
where a structure--

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.290
one isomer or
conformer is locked

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:48.920
in by a lot of hydrogen
bonding, and the bigger

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.510
the molecule, the larger number
of isomerization structures

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:58.010
you have to consider, and
there's a lot of insight there.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.710
So isomerization is
a very crucial thing

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:06.510
in the behavior of
large molecules.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.810
The topic that I don't really
have time for is FRED--

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.655
fluorescence resonance
energy transfer.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.550
Let's just draw a little
picture of a molecule doing

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.770
all sorts of neat things,
and another confirmation

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.430
of that molecule, and we
have donor and acceptor.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.730
So at the opposite
ends of this thing,

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.990
clever chemists can
put things that--

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:45.090
and so this is a molecule which
has an electronically excited

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.790
state.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.670
This fluoresces in the loop.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.050
We excited, say,
in the UV, and it

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.130
fluoresces to the
red of the excitation

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.510
because that would happen.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.330
In condensed phases,
you remove some energy,

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.840
and you fluoresce
from v equals zero.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.730
And we have an acceptor
which absorbs in the blue,

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.820
and fluoresces in the red.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:13.130
And the donor-acceptor
energy transfer

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.545
is related to one
over r to the six.

00:48:15.545 --> 00:48:16.670
Doesn't that look familiar?

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.810
It's a dipole-dipole
interaction,

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.570
or an induced dipole-induced
dipole interaction.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.460
It goes as one
over r to the six,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:33.190
and so we might get a
lot of red fluorescence

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:37.960
from this molecule exciting
in the UV, and much less red

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.620
fluorescence or none because
we've increased the distance.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:53.480
And this works in the range of
I think one to 10 nanometers.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:53.980
Yeah.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.550
So it's a fantastic ruler.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.830
How much red
shifted fluorescence

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.580
do you get from donor to
acceptor energy transfer?

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.020
And it's a measure
of the distance.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.170
And so you have a protein
and a denatured protein.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.710
This distance
changes, and one can

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:18.600
use the way in which the
red fluorescence appears

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.420
as a measure of the structure.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.960
So this is not like small
molecule spectroscopy

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.300
where you calculate moments
of inertia and vibrational

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.230
frequency.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.394
This is really crude.

00:49:30.394 --> 00:49:32.310
This has nothing to do
with quantum mechanics,

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:38.530
except it is, and it's just a
simple measurement of how far

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.810
two things are apart.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.560
And there are all sorts of ways
of using this, including time

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.720
resolved waves,
where you actually

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.380
look at the rate at which
the one kind of fluorescence

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.920
goes away, and the other kind
of fluorescence comes in,

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.050
and many other things.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:00.440
OK, so that's it for
me on photochemistry,

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.280
and you should read
Troy's notes because they

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.470
are much more
germane to what you

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.910
might encounter in real life.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.670
But the bottom-up
approach, I think,

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.370
is useful too, especially
in the importance

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:16.630
of how the matrix elements
and the density of states

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:20.130
scale using simple ideas.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:25.330
So I'll see you on Monday
and blow you away on Monday.

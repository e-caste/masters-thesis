00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today, once again,
a day of solving no

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
differential equations
whatsoever.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The topic is a special kind of
differential equation,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which occurs a lot.
It's one in which the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
right-hand side doesn't have any
independent variable in it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, since I'm going to use as
the independent variable,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
t for time, maybe it would be
better to write the left-hand

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
side to let you know,
since you won't be able to

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
figure out any other way what it
is, dy dt.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We will write it this time.
dy dt is equal to,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the point is that there is
no t on the right hand side.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, there's no t.
There's a name for such an

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
equation.
Now, some people call it time

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
independent.
The only problem with that is

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that sometimes the independent
variable is a time.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's something else.
We need a generic word for

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
there being no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, the word that's used for
that is autonomous.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, that means no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's a function of y alone,
the dependent variable.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, your first reaction should
be, oh, well,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
big deal.
Big deal.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If there's no t on the right
hand side, then we can solve

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this by separating variables.
So, why has he been talking

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about it in the first place?
So, I admit that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We can separate variables,
and what I'm going to talk

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
about today is how to get useful
information out of the equation

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
about how its solutions look
without solving the equation.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The reason for wanting to do
that is, A, it's fast.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It gives you a lot of insight,
and the actual solution,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'll illustrate one,
in the first place,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
take you quite a while.
You may not be able to actually

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
do the integrations,
the required and separation of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
variables to get an explicit
solution, or it might simply not

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
be worth the effort of doing if
you only want certain kinds of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
separations about the solution.
So, the thing is,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the problem is,
therefore, to get qualitative

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
information about the solutions
without actually solving --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Without actually having to
solve the equation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now, to do that,
let's take a quick look at how

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the direction fields of such an
equation, after all,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it's the direction field is our
principal tool for getting

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
qualitative information about
solutions without actually

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
solving.
So, how does the direction

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
field look?
Well, think about it for just a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
second, and you will see that
every horizontal line is an

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
isocline.
So, the horizontal lines,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
what are their equations?
This is the t axis.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And, here's the y axis.
The horizontal lines have the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
formula y equals a constant.
Let's make it y equals a y zero

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for different values of the
constant y zero.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Those are the horizontal lines.
And, the point is they are

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
isoclines.
Why?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Well, because along any one of
these horizontal lines,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'll draw one in,
what are the slopes of the line

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
elements?
The slopes are dy / dt is equal

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to f of y zero,
but that's a constant because

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
there's no t to change as you
move in the horizontal

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
direction.
The slope is a constant.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So, if I draw in that isocline,
I guess I've forgotten,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
as our convention,
isoclines are in dashed lines,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but if you have color,
you are allowed to put them in

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
living yellow.
Well, I guess I could make them

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
solid, in that case.
I don't have to make a dash.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Then, all the line elements,
you put them in at will because

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they will all have,
they are all the same,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and they have slope,
that, f of y0.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And, similarly down here,
they'll have some other slope.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This one will have some other
slope.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Whatever, this is the y zero,
the value of it,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and whatever that happens to
be.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I'll put it one more.
That's the x-axis.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I can use the x-axis.
That's an isocline,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
too.
Now, what do you deduce about

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
how the solutions must look?
Well, let's draw one solution.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Suppose one solution looks like
this.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well, that's an integral curve,
in other words.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Its graph is a solution.
Now, as I slide along,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
these slope elements stay
exactly the same,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I can slide this curb along
horizontally,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and it will still be an
integral curve everywhere.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, in other words,
they integral curves are

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
invariant under translation for
an equation of this type.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
They all look exactly the same,
and you get them all by taking

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
one, and just pushing it along.
Well, that's so simple it's

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
almost uninteresting,
except in that these equations

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
occur a lot in practice.
They are often hard to

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
integrate directly.
And, therefore,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
it's important to be able to
get information about them.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Now, how does one do that?
There's one critical idea,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and that is the notion of a
critical point.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
These equations have what are
called critical points.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And, what it is is very simple.
There are three ways of looking

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
at it: critical point,
y zero;

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
what does it mean for y0 to be
a critical point?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It means, another way of saying
it is that it should be a zero

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
of the right-hand side.
So, if I ask you to find the

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
critical points for the
equation, what you will do is

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
solve the equation f of y equals
zero.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now, what's interesting about
them?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Well, for a critical point,
what would be the slope of the

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
line element along,
if this is at a critical level,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
if that's a critical point?
Look at that isocline.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
What's the slope of the line
elements along it?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It is zero.
And therefore,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
for these guys,
these are, in other words,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
our solution curves.
But let's prove it formally.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, there are three ways of
saying it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
y zero is a critical point.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's a zero of the right-hand
side, or, y equals y0 is a

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
solution to the equation.
Now, that's perfectly easy to

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
verify.
If y zero makes this

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
right-hand side zero,
it's certainly also y equals y0

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
makes the left-hand
side zero because you're

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
differentiating a constant.
So, the reasoning,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
if you want reasoning,
is proof.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Maybe we can make one line out
of a proof.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
To say that it's a solution,
what does it mean to say that

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it's a solution?
It means to say that when you

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
plug it in, plug in this
constant function,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
y0, the dy0 dt is equal to f of
y0.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Is that true?
Yeah.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Both sides are zero.
It's true.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, y0 is not a number.
Well, it is.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's a number on this side,
but on this side,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
what I mean is a constant
function whose constant value is

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
y zero, this function,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and its derivatives are zero
because it has slope zero

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
everywhere.
So, this guy is a constant

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
function, has slope zero.
This is a number which makes

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the right-hand side zero.
Well, that's nice.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, in other words,
what we found are,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
by finding these critical
points, solving that equation,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we found all the horizontal
solutions.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But, what's so good about
those?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Surely, they must be the most
interesting solutions there are.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Well, think of how the picture
goes.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Let's draw in one of those
horizontal solutions.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So, here's a horizontal
solution.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That's a solution.
So, this is my y0.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That's the height at which it
is.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And, I'm assuming that f of y0
equals zero.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So, that's a solution.
Now, the significance of that

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
is, because it's a solution,
in other words,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
it's an integral curve,
remember what's true about

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
integral curves.
Other curves are not allowed to

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
cross them.
And therefore,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
these things are the absolute
barriers.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So, for example,
suppose I have two of them is

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
y0, and let's say here's another
one, another constant solution.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I want to know what the curves
in between those can do.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Well, I do know that whatever
those red curves do,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
the other integral curves,
they cannot cross this,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and they cannot cross that.
And, you must be able to

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
translate them along each other
without ever having two of them

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
intersect.
Now, that really limits their

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
behavior, but I'm going to nail
it down even more.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, other curves can't cross
these.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Other integral curves can't
cross these yellow curves,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
these yellow lines,
these horizontal lines.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But, I'm going to show you
more, and namely,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
so what I'm after is deciding,
without solving the equation,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
what those curves must look
like in between.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Now, the way to do that is you
draw, so if we want to make

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
steps, everybody likes steps,
okay, so step one is going to

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
be, find these.
Find the critical points.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And, you're going to do that by
solving this equation,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
finding out where it's zero.
Once you have done that,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
you are going to draw the graph
of f of y.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And, the interest is going to
be, where is it positive?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Where is it negative?
You've already found where it's

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
zero.
Everywhere else,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
therefore, it must be either
positive or negative.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Now, once you have found that
out, why am I interested in

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that?
Well, because dy / dt is equal

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
to f of y, right?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That's what the differential
equation says.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Therefore, if this,
for example,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
is positive,
that means this must be

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
positive.
It means that y must be

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
increasing.
It means the solution must be

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
increasing.
Where it's negative,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the solution will be
decreasing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And, that tells me how it's
behaving in between these yellow

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
lines, or on top of them,
or on the bottom.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now, at this point,
I'm going to stop,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
or not stop,
I mean, I'm going to stop

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
talking generally.
And everything in the rest of

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the period will be done by
examples which will get

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
increasingly complicated,
not terribly complicated by the

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
end.
But, let's do one that's super

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
simple to begin with.
Sorry, I shouldn't say that

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
because some of you may be
baffled even by here because

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
after all I'm going to be doing
the analysis not in the usual

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
way, but by using new ideas.
That's the way you make

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
progress.
All right, so,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
let's do our bank account.
So, y is money in the bank

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
account.
r is the interest rate.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Let's assume it's a continuous
interest rate.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
All banks nowadays pay interest
continuously,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the continuous interest rate.
So, if that's all there is,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and money is growing,
you know the differential

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
equation says that the rate at
which it grows is equal to r,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
the interest rate times a
principle, the amount that's in

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the bank at that time.
So, that's the differential

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
equation that governs that.
Now, that's,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
of course, the solution is
simply an exponential curve.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
There's nothing more to say
about it.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Now, let's make it more
interesting.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Let's suppose there is a shifty
teller at the bank,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and your money is being
embezzled from your account at a

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
constant rate.
So, let's let w equal,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
or maybe e, but e has so many
other uses in mathematics,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
w is relatively unused,
w is the rate of embezzlement,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
thought of as continuous.
So, every day a little bit of

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
money is sneaked out of your
account because you are not

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
paying any attention to it.
You're off skiing somewhere,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and not noticing what's
happening to your bank account.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So, since it's the rate,
the time rate of embezzlement,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I simply subtract it from this.
It's not w times y because the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
embezzler isn't stealing a
certain fraction of your

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
account.
It's simply stealing a certain

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
number of dollars every day,
the same number of dollars

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
being withdrawn for the count.
Okay, now, of course,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you could solve this.
This separates variables

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
immediately.
You get the answer,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and there's no problem with
that.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Let's analyze the behavior of
the solutions without solving

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the equation by using these two
points.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So, I want to analyze this
equation using the method of

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
critical points.
So, the first thing I should do

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
is, so, here's our equation,
is find the critical points.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Notice it's an autonomous
equation all right,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
because there's no t on the
right-hand side.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Okay, so, the critical points,
well, that's where ry minus w

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
equals zero.
In other words,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
there's only one critical
point, and that occurs when y is

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
equal to w over r.
So, that's the only critical

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
point.
Now, I want to know what's

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
happening to the solution.
So, in other words,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
if I plot, I can write away,
of course, negative values

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
aren't of particularly
interesting here,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
there is definitely a
horizontal solution,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and it has the value,
it's at the height,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
w over r.
That's a solution.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
The question is,
what do the other solutions

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
look like?
Now, watch how I make the

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
analysis because I'm going to
use two now.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So, this is step one,
then step two.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
What do I do? Well,
I'm going to graph f of y.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Well, f of y is ry minus w.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
What does that look like?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Okay, so, here is the y-axis.
Notice the y-axis is going

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
horizontally because what I'm
interested in is the graph of

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
this function.
What do I call the other axis?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I'm going to use the same
terminology that is used on the

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
little visual that describes
this.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And, that's dy.
You could call this other axis

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
the f of y axis.
That's not a good name for it.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
You could call it the dy / dt
axis because it's,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
so to speak,
the other variable.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That's not great either.
But, worst of all would be

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
introducing yet another letter
for which we would have no use

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
whatsoever.
So, let's think of it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We are plotting,
now, the graph of f of y.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
f of y is this function,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
ry minus w.
Well, that's a line.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Its intercept is down here at
w, and so the graph looks

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
something like this.
It's a line.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
This is the line,
ry minus w.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
It has slope r.
Well, what am I going to get

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
out of that line?
Just exactly this.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
What am I interested in about
that line?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Nothing other than where is it
above the axis,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
and where is it below?
This function is positive over

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
here, and therefore,
I'm going to indicate that

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
symbolically,
this, by putting an arrow here.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
The meeting of this arrow is
that y of t is

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
increasing.
See where it's the right-hand

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
side of that last board?
y of t is increasing when f of

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
y is positive.
f of y is positive here,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and therefore,
to the right of this point,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
it's increasing.
Here to the left of it,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
f of y is negative,
and therefore over here it's

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
going to be decreasing.
What point is this,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
in fact?
Well, that's where it crosses

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
the axis.
That's exactly the critical

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
point, w over r.
Therefore, what this says is

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
that a solution,
once it's bigger than y over r,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
it increases,
and it increases faster and

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
faster because this function is
higher and higher.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
And, that represents the rate
of change.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So, in other words,
once the solution,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
let's say a solution starts
over here at time zero.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So, this is the t axis.
And, here is the y axis.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So, now, I'm plotting
solutions.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
If it starts at t equals zero,
above this line,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
that is, starts with the value
w over r,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
which is bigger than zero,
a value bigger than w over r,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
then it increases,
and increases faster and

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
faster.
If it starts below that,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
it decreases and decreases
faster and faster.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Now, in fact,
I only have to draw two of

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
those because what do all the
others look like?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
They are translations.
All the other curves look

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
exactly like those.
They are just translations of

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
them.
This guy, if I start closer,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
it's still going to decrease.
Well, that's supposed to be a

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
translation.
Maybe it is.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
So, these guys look like that.
Let's do just a tiny bit more

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
interpretation of that.
Well, I think I better leave it

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
there because we've got harder
things to do,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000
and I want to make sure we've
got time for it.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Sorry.
Okay, next example,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
a logistic equation.
Some of you have already solved

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
this in recitation,
and some of you haven't.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
This is a population equation.
This is the one that section

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
7.1 and section 1.7 is most
heavily concerned with,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
this particular equation.
The derivation of it is a

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
little vague.
It's an equation which

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
describes how population
increases.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And one minute,
the population behavior of some

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
population, --
-- let's call it,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
y is the only thing I know to
call anything today,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
but of course your book uses
capital P for population,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
to get you used to different
variables.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Now, the basic population
equation runs dy / dt.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
There's a certain growth rate.
Let's call it k y.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So, k is what's called the
growth rate.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
It's actually,
sometimes it's talked about in

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
terms of birthrate.
But, it's the net birth rate.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
It's the rate at which people,
or bacteria,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
or whatever are being born
minus the rate at which they are

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
dying.
So, it's a net birthrate.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
But, let's just call it the
growth rate.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Now, if this is the equation,
we can think of this,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
if k is constant,
that's what's called simple

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
population growth.
And you are all familiar with

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
that.
Logistical growth allows for

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
slightly more complex
situations.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Logistic growth says that
calling k a constant is

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
unrealistic because the Earth is
not filled entirely with people.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
What stops it from having
unlimited growth?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Well, the fact that the
resources, the food,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
the organism has to live on
gets depleted.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And, in other words,
the growth rate declines as y

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
increases.
As the population increases,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
one expects the growth rate to
decline because resources are

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
being used up,
and they are not indefinitely

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
available.
Well, in other words,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
we should replace k by a
function with this behavior.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
What's the simplest function
that declines as y increases?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
The simplest choice,
and if you are ignorant about

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
what else to do,
stick with the simplest,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
at least you won't work any
harder than you have to,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
would be to take k equal to the
simplest declining function of y

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
there is, which is simply a
linear function,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
A minus BY.
So, if I use that as the choice

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
of the declining growth rate,
the new equation is dy / dt

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
equals, here's my new k.
The y stays the same,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
so the equation becomes a minus
by, the quantity times y,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
or in other words,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
ay minus b y squared.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
This equation is what's called
the logistic equation.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
It has many applications,
not just to population growth.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
It's applied to the spread of
disease, the spread of a rumor,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
the spread of many things.
Yeah, a couple pieces of chalk

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
here.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Okay, now, those of you who
have solved it know that the

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
explicit solution involves,
well, you separate variables,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
but you will have to use
partial fractions,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
ugh, I hope you love partial
fractions.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
You're going to need them later
in the term.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
But, I could avoid them now by
not solving the equation

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
explicitly.
But anyway, you get a solution,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
which I was going to write on
the board for you,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
but you could look it up in
your book.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's unpleasant enough looking
to make you feel that there must

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
be an easier way at least to get
the basic information out.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Okay, let's see if we can get
the basic information out.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
What are the critical points?
Well, this is pretty easy.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
A, I want to set the right-hand
side equal to zero.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So, I'm going to solve the
equation.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I can factor out a y.
It's going to be y times a

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
minus by equals zero.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
And therefore,
the critical points are where y

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
equals zero. That's one.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And, the other factor is when
this factor is zero,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
and that happens when y is
equal to a over b.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So, there are my two critical
points.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Okay, what does,
let's start drawing pictures of

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
solutions.
Let's put it in those right

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
away.
Okay, the critical point,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
zero, gives me a solution that
looks like this.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And, the critical point,
a over b,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
those are positive numbers.
So, that's somewhere up here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
So, those are two solutions,
constant solutions.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
In other words,
if the population by dumb luck

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
started at zero,
it would stay at zero for all

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
time.
That's not terribly surprising.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
But, it's a little less obvious
that if it starts at that magic

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
number, a over b,
it will also stay at that magic

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
number for all time without
moving up or down or away from

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
it.
Now, the question is,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
therefore, what happens in
between?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So, for the in between,
I'm going to make that same

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
analysis that I made before.
And, it's really not very hard.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Look, so here's my dy/dt-axis.
I'll call that y prime,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
okay?
And, here's the y-axis.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So, I'm now doing step two.
This was step one.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Okay, the function that I want
to graph is this one,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
ay minus b y squared,
or in factor form,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
y times a minus by.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Now, this function,
we know, has a zero.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
It has a zero here,
and it has a zero at the point

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
a over b.
At these two critical points,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
it has a zero.
What is it doing in between?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Well, in between,
it's a parabola.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
It's a quadratic function.
It's a parabola.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Does it go up or does it go
down?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Well, when y is very large,
it's very negative.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
That means it must be a
downward-opening parabola.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And therefore,
this curve looks like this.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
So, I'm interested in knowing,
where is it positive,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
and where is it negative?
Well, it's positive,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
here, for this range of values
of y.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Since it's positive there,
it will be increasing there.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Here, it's negative,
and therefore it will be

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
decreasing.
Here, it's negative,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
and therefore,
dy / dt will be negative also,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
and therefore the function,
y, will be decreasing here.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
So, how do these other
solutions look?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Well, we can put them in.
I'll put them in in white,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
okay, because this has got to
last until the end of the term.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
So, how are they doing?
They are increasing between the

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
two curves.
They are not allowed to cross

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
either of these yellow curves.
But, they are always

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
increasing.
Well, if they're always

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
increasing, they must start here
and increase,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
and not allowed to cross.
It must do something like that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
This must be a translation of
it.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
In other words,
the curves must look like that.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Those are supposed to be
translations of each other.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I know they aren't,
but use your imaginations.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
But what's happening above?
So in other words,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
if I start with a population
anywhere bigger than zero but

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
less than a over b,
it increases asymptotically to

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
the level a over b.
What happens if I start above

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
that?
Well, then it decreases to it

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
because, this way,
for the values of y bigger than

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
a over b,
it decreases as time increases.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
So, these guys up here are
doing this.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And, how about the ones below
the axis?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Well, they have no physical
significance.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
But let's put them in anyway.
Whether they doing?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
They are decreasing away from
zero.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So, these guys don't mean
anything physically,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
but mathematically they exist.
Their solutions,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
they're going down like that.
Now, you notice from this

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
picture that there are,
even though both of these are

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
constant solutions,
they have dramatically

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
different behavior.
This one, this solution,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
is the one that all other
solutions try to approach as

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
time goes to infinity.
This one, the solution zero,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
is repulsive,
as it were.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Any solution that starts near
zero, if it starts at zero,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
of course, it stays there for
all time, but if it starts just

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
a little bit above zero,
it increases to a over b.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
This is called a stable

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
solution because everybody tries
to get closer and closer to it.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
This is called,
zero is also a constant

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
solution, but this is an
unstable solution.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And now, usually,
solution is too general a word.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I think it's better to call it
a stable critical point,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
and an unstable critical point.
But, of course,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
it also corresponds to a
solution.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
So, critical points are not all
the same.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Some are stable,
and some are unstable.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And, you can see which is which
just by looking at this picture.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
If the arrows point towards
them, you've got a stable

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
critical point.
If it arrows point away from

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
them, you've got an unstable
critical point.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Now, there is a third
possibility.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Okay, I think we'd better
address it because otherwise

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
you're going to sit there
wondering, hey,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
what did he do?
Suppose it looks like this.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Suppose it were just tangent.
Well, this is the picture of

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
that curve, the pink curve.
What would the arrows look like

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
then?
What would the arrows look like

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
then?
Well, since they are positive,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
it's always positive,
the arrow goes like this.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And then on the side,
it also goes in the same

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
direction.
So, is this critical point

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
stable or unstable?
It's stable if you approach it

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
from the left.
So, how, in fact,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
do the curves,
how would the corresponding

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
curves look?
Well, there's our long-term

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
solution.
This corresponds to that point.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Let's call this a,
and then this will be the

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
value, a.
If I start below it,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I rise to it.
If I start above it,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
I increase.
So, if I start above it,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I do this.
Well, now, that's stable on one

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
side, and unstable on the other.
And, that's indicated by saying

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
it's semi-stable.
That's a brilliant word.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I wonder how long it to do
think that one up,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
semi-stable critical point:
stable on one side,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
unstable on the other depending
on whether you start below it.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And, of course,
it could be reversed if I had

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
drawn the picture the other way.
I could have approached it from

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
the top, and left it from below.
You get the idea of the

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
behavior.
Okay, let's now take,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I'm going to soup up this
logistic equation just a little

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
bit more.
So, let's talk about the

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
logistic equation.
But, I'm going to add to it

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
harvesting, with harvesting.
So, this is a very late 20th

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
century concept.
So, we imagine,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
for example,
a bunch of formerly free range

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Atlantic salmon penned in one of
these huge factory farms off the

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
coast of Maine or someplace.
They've made salmon much

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
cheaper than it used to be,
but at a certain cost to the

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
salmon, and possibly to our
environment.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So, what happens?
Well, the salmon grow,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
and grow, and do what salmon
do.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And, they are harvested.
That's a word somewhere in the

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
category of ethnic cleansing in
my opinion.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
But, it's, again,
a very 20th-century word.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I think it was Hitler who
discovered that,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
that all you had to do was call
something by a sanitary name,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
and no matter how horrible it
was, good bourgeois people would

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
accept it.
So, the harvesting,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
which means,
of course, picking them up and

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
killing them,
and putting them in cans and

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
stuff like that,
okay, so what's the equation?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
I'm going to assume that the
harvest is at a constant time

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
rate.
In other words,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
it's not a certain fraction of
all the salmon that are being

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
caught each day and canned.
The factory has a certain

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
capacity, so,
400 pounds of salmon each day

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
are pulled out and canned.
So, it's a constant time rate.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
That means that the equation is
now going to be dy/dt is equal

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
to, well, salmon grow
logistically.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
ay minus b y squared,
so, that part of the

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
equation is the same.
But, I need a term to take care

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
of this constant harvesting
rate, and that will be h.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Let's call it h,
not h times y.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Then, I would be harvesting a
certain fraction of all the

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
salmon there,
which is not what I'm doing.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Okay: our equation.
Now, I want to analyze what the

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
critical points of this look
like.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Now, this is a little more
subtle because there's now a new

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
parameter, there.
And, what I want to see is how

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
that varies with the new
parameter.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
The best thing to do is,
I mean, the thing not to do is

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
make this equal to zero,
fiddle around with the

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
quadratic formula,
get some massive expression,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
and then spend the next half
hour scratching your head trying

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
to figure out what it means,
and what information you are

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
supposed to be getting out of
it.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Draw pictures instead.
Draw pictures.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
If h is zero,
that's the smallest harvesting

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
rate I could have.
The picture looks like our old

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
one.
So, if h is zero,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
the picture looks like,
what color did I,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
okay, pink.
Yellow.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Yellow is the cheapest,
but I can't find it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Okay, yellow is commercially
available.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
These are precious.
All right, purple if it's okay,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
purple.
So, this is the one,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
our original one corresponding
to h equals zero.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Or, in other words,
it's the equation ay minus b y

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
squared. h is zero.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Now, if I want to find,
I now want to increase the

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
value of h, well,
if I increase the value of h,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
in other words,
harvest more and more,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
what's happening?
Well, I simply lower this

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
function by h.
So, if I lower h somewhat,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
it will come to here.
So, this is some value,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
ay minus b y squared minus h1,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
let's say.
That's this curve.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
If I lower it a lot,
it will look like this.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
So, ay minus b y squared minus
h a lot, h twenty.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
This doesn't mean anything.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Two.
Obviously, there's one

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000
interesting value to lower it
by.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
It's a value which would lower
it exactly by this amount.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Let me put that in special.
If I lower it by just that

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
amount, the curve always looks
the same.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
It's just been lowered.
I'm going to say this one is,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
so this one is the same thing,
except that I've subtracted h

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
sub m. Where is h sub m on

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000
the picture?
Well, I lowered it by this

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
amount.
So, this height is h sub m.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
In other words,
if I find the maximum height

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
here, which is easy to do
because it's a parabola,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
and lower it by exactly that
amount, I will have lowered it

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
to this point.
This will be a critical point.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Now, the question is,
what's happened to the critical

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
point as I did this?
I started with the critical

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
points here and here.
As I lower h,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
the critical point changed to
this and that.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And now, it changed to this one
when I got to the purple line.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
And, as I went still further
down, there were no critical

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
points.
So, this curve has no critical

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
points attached to it.
What are the corresponding

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
pictures?
Well, the corresponding

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
pictures, well,
we've already drawn,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
the picture for h equals zero
is drawn already.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
The pictures that I'm talking
about are how the solutions

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
look.
How would the solution look

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
like for this one for h one?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
For h1, the solutions look
like, here is a over b.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Here is a over b,
but the critical points aren't

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
at zero and a over b anymore.
They've moved in a little bit.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
So, they are here and here.
And, otherwise,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
the solutions look just like
they did before,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
and the analysis is the same.
And, similarly,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
if h two goes very far,
if h2 is very large,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
there are no critical points.
h, too large,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
no critical points.
Are the solutions decreasing

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
all the time or increasing?
Well, they are always

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
decreasing because the function
is always negative.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Solutions always go down,
always.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
The interesting one is this
last one, where I decreased it

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
just to (h)m.
And, what happens there is

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
there is this certain,
magic critical point whose

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
value we could calculate.
There's one constant solution.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So, this is one that has the
value.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Sorry, I'm calculating the
solutions out.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
So, y here and t here,
so here it is value,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
(h)m is the value by which it
has been lowered.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So, this is the picture for
(h)m.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And, how do the solutions look?
Well, to the right of that,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
they are decreasing.
And, to the left they are also

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
decreasing because this function
is always negative.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000
So, the solutions look like
this, if you start above,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
and if you start below,
they decrease.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
And, of course,
they can't get lower than zero

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
because these are salmon.
What is the significance of

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
(h)m?
(h)m is the maximum rate of

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
harvesting.
It's an extremely important

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
number for this industry.
If the maximum time rate at

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
which you can pull the salmon
daily out of the water,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
and can them without what
happening?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Without the salmon going to
zero.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
As long as you start above,
and don't harvest it more than

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
this rate, it will be following
these curves.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
You will be following these
curves, and you will still have

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
salmon.
If you harvest just a little

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
bit more, you will be on this
curve that has no critical

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
points, and the salmon in the
tank will decrease to zero.

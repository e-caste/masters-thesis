00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.560
In kinematics, if we
know acceleration,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.220
which we generally can get
from Newton's second law,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.160
then we'd like to
integrate the acceleration

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.250
to get velocity and position.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.100
How does that work
for circular motion?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.810
Well, when you think
about circular motion

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.280
and you think about the
tangential direction,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.730
then that, in some sense,
is a one-dimensional motion.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.830
And so what we'll see is that
the tangential description

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.990
of this motion can be integrated
to get the tangential velocity

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.190
and position, just
in a similar way

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400
that we did with
linear motion, where

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.030
if we were given
the acceleration,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.890
we integrated
velocity and position.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.980
So let's look at a
particular example.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.790
Suppose we're given that
the tangential component

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.210
of the acceleration is given
by some simple polynomial, A

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.230
minus Bt.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.140
Now, in this case,
the acceleration

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.970
is certainly non-constant.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.860
What we'd like to
do-- remember, this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.090
is equal to rd squared
theta dt squared.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.180
So if we integrate the
tangential component

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.960
of the acceleration
with some variable

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.730
from t prime going from
some initial value, which

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.880
we can call 0, to
some final value,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.480
then that will
give us the change

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.600
in the tangential velocity.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.550
So for this case,
V theta of t is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.660
equal to V theta t0 plus the
integral of A minus B t prime

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.890
d t prime.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.950
Now, we needed an integration
variable because recall

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.660
that our functional
dependence is the upper limit

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.970
of the integral.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.060
We saw that in
one-dimensional kinematics.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.270
So we're going from some
t0 0 to some prime t prime.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.110
Well, this integral
is now-- we'll

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.610
write this V theta 0, where,
again, t0 we're calling 0.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.950
And when we do this integral,
A minus B t prime and d

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.780
t prime-- that's an integral
from 0 to t prime equals t.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.760
t prime equals 0.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.950
This integral is not hard to do.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.020
We get A of t minus
1/2 B of t squared.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.829
And there's that
constant initial term.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.490
And so the velocity at time
t of the tangential component

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.930
of the velocity is given
by that expression.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.390
In exactly the same fashion,
the angle-- how much angle

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.990
does this go through?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.640
Well, we have to
be careful there.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.520
So if we want to do
the arc length, s of t,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.890
we have to multiply the
angle by the radius.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.020
And that is just the integral
of the tangential component

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.650
of the velocity from t prime
equal 0 to time t prime t.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.930
And so in this example, we
have a slightly complicated

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.390
integral, V0 d t prime, 0 to t.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm going to drop--
well, I'll write it

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.290
in-- t prime plus the
integrals A t prime minus 1/2

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.550
B t prime squared.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.450
I didn't need to split this up.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.829
But I'm splitting it up, anyway.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.420
And I have really one,
two, three integrals to do.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.300
And what I get is V
theta 0 t-- the result

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.520
of the first integral.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.300
The result of the second
interval is 1/2 At squared.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.090
And the result of
the third integral

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.000
is minus 1/6 B t cubed.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.230
And that gives me this.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.370
I have to be a little
careful on this side.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:14.570
It's how much has the arc length
changed as we go from time 0

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.060
to time t.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.034
So that's the change
in arc length.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.850
And that's a typical
example of where we're

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.390
given tangential acceleration.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.530
We integrate it to get
the tangential velocity.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.140
And then when we integrate
the tangential velocity,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.470
we're getting the change in
arc length around the circle.

[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:03.976
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:05.467
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.270
So today we're going to
continue our discussion

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.830
about photosynthesis.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.570
And last time, I introduced
the reactions of photosynthesis

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.110
and pointed out that really
what we're talking about

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.120
is oxidation
reduction reactions.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.500
And so the net reaction
of photosynthesis--

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.920
water plus carbon dioxide goes
to carbohydrate and oxygen--

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.650
is really the opposite
of burning wood.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.870
So if burning wood, carbon
oxidation, is favorable,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.570
reversing this, obviously,
needs energy input.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.090
And that energy input is light
that's coming from the sun.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.620
And we started to discuss a bit
about how this reaction works.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.840
And I mentioned
that photosynthesis

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.990
is broken down into light
reactions and dark reactions.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.790
And so the light
reactions are really

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
along the same lines of the
oxidative phosphorylation

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.390
electron transport
chain that we described.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.310
And that is basically
using energy

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
from the sun to use water
as an electron donor

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.990
to generate NADPH,
as well as oxygen.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.020
In doing so, light from the sun
makes this process favorable.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.270
That favorable electron
transport can then

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.060
be used to generate delta psi,
delta pH, which can create ATP,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.910
do other work just like
oxidative phosphorylation.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.280
Of course, photosynthesis
comes first, oxidative

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.780
phosphorylation came second,
even though we taught it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230
in the reverse order.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.630
And these reactions
also produce NADPH,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.160
which can be used in the
so-called dark reactions

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.240
to synthesize carbohydrates.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.120
Now, the dark reactions,
again, I mentioned,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.660
can be done in the
light or the dark.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.650
They don't need light.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.470
They use the NADPH from
the light reactions,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.470
as well as the ATP produced
from the light reactions

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.580
to take CO2 and turn
it into carbohydrate.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.800
And that allows plants to store
carbon, reduced carbon energy,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.170
for later, such that
when the sun is not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.980
shining they can then use that
carbohydrate to oxidize it

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.950
in all of the reactions
we've already learned about

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.440
and make sure they're
able to generate ATP,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.960
keep their ATP-ADP
ratio high at night,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.180
and then switch back to
using photosynthesis when

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.520
the sun is out during the day.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.100
Now, today what we're
going to discuss

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.950
is both the light and the
dark reactions in great detail

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.440
to fill in how those
processes happen.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.490
So first, we're going to start
with the light reactions.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.790
And so the light
reactions, if it's

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.100
like oxidative
phosphorylation, that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.220
is we're going to generate
a membrane potential,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.680
build a battery, that is
to occur at a membrane.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.160
And so those membranes are the
cell membrane of a bacteria,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:25.120
or prokaryote, or an
intracellular membrane

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.990
of a eukaryotic
photosynthetic organism.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.640
And that intracellular membrane
is, of course, the chloroplast

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.020
that you learned
about in grade school.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.260
And so the chloroplast is
the photosynthetic equivalent

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.790
of the mitochondria.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.980
Oxidative phosphorylation
in eukaryotes

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.720
happen at a
mitochondrial membrane.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.360
And photosynthesis
in eukaryotes happens

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.800
at a chloroplast membrane.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.370
And so, just to be
explicit about this,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.490
so if this is our
photosynthetic bacteria,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.960
some prokaryotic cell, it
will use photosynthesis

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.750
to make delta psi, delta pH
across the cell membrane.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.790
And then it can utilize
that to provide energy

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.730
for the organism,
very similar to what

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.390
we said about oxidative
phosphorylation in a bacteria.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.490
And you can imagine
that then there

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.680
was some early eukaryotic
cell that ended up engulfing

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.710
this photosynthetic prokaryote.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.460
And in the process,
the ATP generated

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.850
could be exchanged for ADP
across those membranes.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.090
And in the end, this is
how one ends up with this

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:59.490
double-membraned organelle
within the engulfed prokaryotic

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.400
species, with having the
membrane potential built across

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.300
this--

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.700
oops-- having the
membrane potential

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.090
built across this inner
mitochondrial membrane--

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.540
or inner membrane of, in
this case, the chloroplast.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.480
And so, if you remember,
we drew the mitochondria

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.635
as having this double
membrane structure,

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:23.010
the inner
mitochondrial membrane,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.020
where oxidative
phosphorylation happen.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.650
Protons were pumped into
this intermembrane space.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.570
And chloroplasts have
basically the same structure,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.240
but it's a little
bit more complicated,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.320
at least on the surface.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.090
And that's because chloroplasts
have evolved this further

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.850
to have what, essentially,
are extreme cristae,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.640
those folds of the
mitochondria called cristae.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.440
These extreme folds is basically
what happens in a chloroplast.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.790
So if we draw here a
giant chloroplast--

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.960
so this here would be the outer
membrane of the chloroplast.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.570
So the chloroplast also
has an inner membrane.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.130
So this here is then the inner
membrane of the chloroplast.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:18.560
You can imagine that if you
had this extreme folding

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.350
in of the cristae, but
actually pinched off

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.750
this little piece of
membrane here, you

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.890
would now end up with
stacks of membrane

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.340
within the chloroplast.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.010
You still here have
this inner membrane here

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.140
that goes all the
way around, but now

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.840
you have these little
membrane stacks that now

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.820
exist within the chloroplast.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.690
These here is called grana.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:52.910
And this inside of these stacks,
what is called the lumen,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.660
is really the equivalent
of the intermembrane space

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.170
of the mitochondria.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.460
So the inside of this
is basically equivalent

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.700
to the intermembrane
space of the mitochondria,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.310
such that if I draw one of these
pinched off pieces of membrane

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.470
in gigantic form, you're
basically pumping protons

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.470
into the lumen, into this
intermembrane space equivalent.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.970
And so you can imagine that you
have this electron transport

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.150
chain set up, where electrons
are transferred from water

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.100
to NADP+, making
oxygen an NADPH.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.910
That is, electron
transport is made favorable

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.920
by light that generates
a membrane potential

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:53.830
across this membrane, which
is, by the way, this membrane--

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.240
which is the same
there-- this is

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.790
called the thylakoid membrane.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.670
Thylakoid--
T-H-Y-L-A-K-O-I-D-- membrane.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.140
So you build a potential
across this thylakoid membrane,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:24.040
and then that
potential can be used

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:32.820
to synthesize ATP
within this other space,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.039
this wider space here, which
is called the stroma, which

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:44.500
is the equivalent of the
matrix of the mitochondria.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.120
And so basically,
the chloroplast

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.210
is set up in a very similar
way to the mitochondria,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.180
but because it makes
these membrane stacks,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.170
it looks like it's a
little bit different.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.540
But it's really pumping protons
into the intermembrane space,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.300
which would happen in the
mitochondria an equivalent

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.780
space, which is the
lumen of these stacks,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.850
is what happens within
the chloroplast.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.810
That charge on the membrane,
that delta psi, delta pH,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.650
can then be used to do
work like synthesizing ATP.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.740
That happens in-- rather than--

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.500
and that happens in the stroma
of the matrix equivalent,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.580
the stroma of the chloroplast.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.330
And so effectively,
you have NADPH,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.880
an ATP produced in the stroma.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.560
And so it turns out the
dark reactions, when

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.740
we talk about them
later, will occur here

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.470
in the stroma of
the chloroplast.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.170
And the light
reactions, of course,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:53.125
are happening over here
at the thylakoid membrane.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.590
Now, this is actually
a cool innovation

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.060
that nature has come
up with for this.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.230
And because by making
these extreme cristae,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.750
you can imagine that
there's a very small space

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.000
here that you're
pumping protons into.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.080
That means that fewer protons
pump will allow you to generate

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:21.640
a higher potential, a higher
gradient of protons, delta pH.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.190
And so that means that that
then can be used to drive energy

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.620
in a more efficient
way then you might

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:36.430
get using this much larger
intermembrane space.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.670
And so light reactions here
at the thylakoid membrane

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.040
within the chloroplast,
dark reactions

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.820
here in the stroma
of the chloroplast.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.140
All right.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.210
So that's the anatomy.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.020
Now, let's get back to what's
actually happening here

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.160
in these light reactions.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.640
So of course, the trick
of the light reactions

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.230
is to come up with some way
to make water a good electron

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.680
donor, such that you can
have favorable electron

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.850
transfer to NADPH, which
is, of course, what's

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.470
necessary to have energy
released to generate delta psi,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.910
delta pH.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.010
And so, of course,
to do this, we still

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.310
have to follow all the same
thermodynamic rules that

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.460
existed before,
that we talked about

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.480
for oxidative phosphorylation.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.270
So you should remember
from those lectures

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.940
that electron transfer
is going to be favorable

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.720
if we move from a lower
to a higher standard

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.580
reduction potential.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.230
So if we just draw this out.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:44.210
So here's a physiological
range of standard reduction

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:52.890
potentials from negative
1.6 to positive 0.8 volts.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.890
So this here would be a range of
standard reduction potentials.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.360
So remember, a change in
standard reduction potential

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.310
that's positive, that means
moving this direction down,

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.870
as I've drawn this axis
from smaller to larger.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.990
I realize I drew it upside
down in the way you probably

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.670
are normally used
to looking at this.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.170
But basically, if
you go from a more

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.480
negative to a positive
number, or a more negative

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.150
to a less negative, or a
positive to a more positive,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.930
basically, a change
in this direction,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.470
which is going to
have a positive change

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.330
in standard reduction
potential, is

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.840
going to end up having a
negative change in delta g--

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.920
not prime.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.900
And so that means
equilibrium is going

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.590
to favor electron transport
moving down in this direction.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.550
So now, let's just give
this some real numbers.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:50.870
So the standard reduction
potential of oxygen water

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.290
sits down here.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.400
It's 0.86.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.770
You don't have to worry
about exact numbers.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:09.282
The standard reduction
potential of NADH, or NADPH,

00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:09.990
they're the same.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.060
The nicotinamide group is here.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.990
It's about negative 0.32.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.300
And this is why oxidative
phosphorylation works

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.900
is because there is
a net positive change

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.280
in standard reduction potential.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.540
That is, you go from a
lower to a higher standard

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.470
reduction potential
if we do electron

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.880
transport in the
oxidative phosphorylation.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.640
That means energy is released
as we transfer electrons

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.700
from NADH to oxygen.
So that is favorable.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.220
That favorable energy
release is what

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.590
can be coupled to proton
pumping to generate

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.550
delta psi, delta pH, and allow
the cell to do other work.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:01.360
Now, you cannot change the
properties of water just

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.270
because you add light to it.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.840
So it still sits at this
standard reduction potential.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.240
But what happens
in photosynthesis

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.480
is basically you use light
to excite an electron.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.760
That effectively
moves water up here

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.050
to a more negative
electron up here,

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.910
to generate an
electron that's up here

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.280
at a more negative
standard reduction

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.710
potential than NADPH, which,
of course, now moving down,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.960
becomes favorable.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.900
And so here, now you're going
from more negative to here.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.430
And then from there to there,
each of those is favorable.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.310
This means you can use
this favorable electron

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.030
transfer, the energy release
from the favorable movement

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.920
of electrons from this
excited electron, to NADPH,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.360
generate NADPH.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.920
And then you can also use--

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.710
donate those to the
electron transport chain

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.900
and OXPHOS with oxygen--

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.290
with water-- with oxygen as the
final electron acceptor to net

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.630
generate delta psi,
delta pH in OXPHOS.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.010
And so this works to generate
it in photosynthesis,

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.570
and this works to generate it
in oxidative phosphorylation.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.360
And we've not violated any
laws of thermodynamics.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.170
And we're able
to, in both cases,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.910
create this membrane
potential, build

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.920
this battery, that
now allows you

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.960
to do work such
as synthesize ATP,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.690
keep the ATP-ADP ratio
high, allow the cell

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.960
to do all the unfavorable
reactions that it needs to do.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.710
So now, let's talk a
bit about this process.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.640
So of course, this happens
with visible light,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.570
but I want to start with
asking a fundamental question.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.910
Why do we use visible light?

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.320
Or, to put it another way,
what is visible light, anyway?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.490
Well, visible light
is, of course, just

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.770
electromagnetic
radiation, a photon

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.740
on the electromagnetic
radiation spectrum.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.860
And visible light is
defined by what we see.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.730
So if we draw this out--

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.340
this is hopefully
something that you've

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.860
covered in a physics class
somewhere along the way.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:31.360
So if this here is the
electromagnetic magnetic

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.530
spectrum as drawn out-- so
down here you have your short

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.800
wavelength
electromagnetic radiation,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.800
down here you have your
long wavelength things--

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.280
so higher energy, lower energy--

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.220
and on this end,
X-ray, UV light.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.560
And you get to the
visible spectrum

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.710
and we go from the purple
light down to the red light.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.500
And eventually, we get
into the infrared light,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.740
and ultimately,
down to microwaves,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.609
and basically shorter wavelength
and longer length wavelengths,

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.560
more energy, less energy.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.650
And so just to give you
some numbers, so this here

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.300
is on the order
of 300 kilojoules,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.270
is on the order
of 170 kilojoules.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.960
And so ADP to ATP
conversion-- so we before

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.670
talked about in kcals
per mole, but it's

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.550
on the order of 30
kilojoules for that.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.130
And so this part of the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.620
is the right order
of magnitude, it

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.480
turns out, to transduce
energy in a realm that

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.400
matches the energy required,
or release, from the ATP

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.180
to ADP conversion reaction.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.500
You also know from
just popular use,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.630
you go out in the sun
when it's a nice day,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.800
you put sunscreen on.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.920
Why do you do that?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.730
That's because the
UV light that's

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.830
filtered through our
atmosphere from the sun

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.120
can cause sunburns.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.480
That is, it can cause
damage to our skin,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.760
to other biological molecules.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.700
Obviously, X-rays, you
go get an X-ray done,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.950
you get covered with lead
in all the places they don't

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.610
want to have the X-ray done.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.110
Why?

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.220
Because X-rays can cause damage.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.860
We use those to treat cancer.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.060
And so things down on this
end, too much energy damages

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.950
biological molecules.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.370
This is the sweet spot where
you don't get a lot of damage

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.900
to the biological molecules.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.300
And the energy is
right to synthesize--

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.250
to transduce energy
on a magnitude that

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.140
works for biological systems.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.790
Come down to this
end, well, now you

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.440
get to be too little energy.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.380
You get down to the
infrared and the microwaves.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.850
This is like your
TV remote control.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.577
This is the cell phones that
if you were in class as opposed

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.660
to listening to this online,
you would be checking

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.130
instead of listening to me.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.210
So this direction,
too little energy

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.260
is transduced to actually matter
for the biological systems.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.610
And so that's really why
this spectrum of light

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.190
is what's involved
in photosynthesis.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.860
However, I also
want to remind you

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.090
that visible light
is a human construct.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.480
It's what we as humans can see.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.620
And photosynthesis evolved
long before humans.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.010
We needed photosynthesis
first before any animal life

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.480
can evolve.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.140
And so this visible
light designation

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.660
is completely arbitrary.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.890
And in fact, we evolved from
photosynthetic organisms.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.350
And so it's really
photosynthetic pigments

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.520
that evolved first to
capture light in this range

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.540
that we then repurposed
in order to see.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.880
So in essence, photosynthesis
defines the visual spectrum,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.270
because what we see is
defined by the pigments that

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.190
came-- because it evolved
from photosynthesis.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.760
The carotenoids,
the carrot, the why

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.510
do eat carrots that
are good for our eyes?

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.780
They have the pigments
in carrots, carotenoids--

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.490
which we'll draw
in a little bit--

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.080
that are ultimately related
to our visual pigments.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.430
And we didn't invent those.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.170
Photosynthetic
organisms invented

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.520
those to work in this
spectrum to harvest light

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.840
from the sun for energy.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.410
And we repurposed those
molecules as a way for us

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.680
to see.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.370
So how does this work?

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.020
Well, again, I got to remind you
of a little bit more physics,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.460
a little quantum physics.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.620
This is not--
obviously, we're not

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.378
going to go into
this at the level you

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:54.920
get in a physics
class, and hopefully

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.570
you've seen this before.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.370
But you remember,
if you think back

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.280
to physics and
physical chemistry,

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.410
that electrons sit in discrete
orbitals within molecules.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.300
So we can draw those
orbitals like this.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.400
And so you'd have some
electron pair sitting there

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.830
in some orbital in a molecule.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:22.830
And if you deliver light with
the right amount of energy,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.510
the right quanta of
energy, you can now

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:32.420
excite one of those electrons
up here into a orbital

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.970
with a higher energy.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.230
And of course, that's not
stable, so it will decay.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:47.000
And when that electron decays
back to the ground state,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.720
this then re-releases
another photon of light

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.300
at a longer wavelength.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.270
So longer wavelength
light is emitted,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.920
and that's effectively
fluorescence.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.730
So you excite something,
electron bounces up

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.830
into a higher
orbital, it decays,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.610
releases some of the
energy that it absorbed

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.710
as it transitions back.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.180
That is fluorescence.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.800
This happens very, very fast.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.600
And basically what
photosynthesis

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.860
does is it takes advantage
of this excited state.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.970
And it effectively transfers
that electron away,

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.820
creating a charged
separation prior

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:34.900
to that electron decaying back
into the ground state orbital.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.400
This occurs very fast.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.880
And so photosynthesis has to
occur very, very fast in order

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.680
to make this work.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.300
And in essence, this is
the way that photosynthesis

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.780
is able to capture
energy and connect it

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.600
to a biological system
that allows us to build

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.560
an electron transport chain.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.490
And so in essence,
photosynthesis, the way

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.270
the energy is absorbed, is it's
what you learned in physics.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.610
The right quanta of
light causes an electron

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.070
to excite into a
higher energy orbital.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.170
And then that electron
is transferred away,

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.780
creating a charged
separation before

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.570
that energy of that
excited electron

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.610
can decay as fluorescence.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.040
That creates a
charged separation.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.990
And that charged separation
now has an electron such

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:28.330
that that electron can now be
favorably transferred to NADPH.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.430
That energy released in
that favorable transfer

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.060
can be coupled to make
delta psi, delta pH.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.810
And then that
translates as energy

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.900
in exactly the same
way we learned about

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.100
for oxidative phosphorylation.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.040
So to do this, what do we need?

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.930
Well, we need a pigment that
can absorb a photon of the right

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.350
wavelength-- or, put it another
way, of the right energy--

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.120
and then quickly transfer
that electron away.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.330
And so you need two things.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.930
You need light
acceptors that can

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.370
absorb energy of
the right energy,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.900
the right wavelength of light,
and redox carriers to transfer

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.340
those electrons away.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.470
So what are the light acceptors?

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.510
Well, these are
basically pigments

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.910
that can absorb visible light.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.130
And redox carriers
are electron carriers,

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.860
which we've been talking about
now for several lectures.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.690
So let's start with
the light acceptor.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.090
So this is something that's
tuned to the right energy,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.200
the right wavelength.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.680
And so this is chlorophyll.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.280
So we all know plants
contain chlorophyll.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.260
That's important
for photosynthesis.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.180
Well, what is chlorophyll?

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.120
Well, it's a conjugated
pyrrole, very similar

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.955
to heme, except remember,
heme had iron in it.

00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:49.580
Saw that for hemoglobin, saw it
again in the electron transport

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.285
chain.

00:24:50.285 --> 00:24:51.620
And I'm going to
show you chlorophyll.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.495
Chlorophyll is going to
look a lot like that,

00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:58.610
except it has a magnesium
conjugated to the tetrapyrrole

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.950
rather than iron.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:36.080
And so here you
have tetrapyrrole

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.070
with a magnesium in the
middle, conjugated double bond

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.170
system all the way around.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.740
Makes sense, that should
absorb visible light,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.620
all those conjugated
double bonds.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.180
There's some R group decorations
hanging off over here.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:57.730
Chlorophyll also has this
additional decoration

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:11.370
over here, including a long
lipid tail here to make this--

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.955
it will sit within a membrane.

00:26:18.788 --> 00:26:19.288
Oops.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.060
Apologies.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.790
I misdrew that.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.640
Lipid tail hangs off down there.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.040
But this here is
effectively what

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.550
the structure of
chlorophyll looks like,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.608
with this R and R prime
being specific groups.

00:26:54.608 --> 00:26:56.150
You can look up if
you're interested.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.290
But basically, these
are the decorations

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:08.120
that define what I refer to as
A type and B type chlorophylls.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.090
Remember, we had A, B, and
C type cytochromes that

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.030
were basically similar molecules
with slightly different

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.150
decorations on them, the
types defined slightly

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:21.260
by the absorbance properties
of these pigments.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.540
But effectively, what's
key about chlorophyll

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.460
is that it's this
conjugated, double bond

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.630
system in the tetrapyrrole
that ultimately allows

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.080
it to absorb visible light.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.810
Now, chlorophyll is, of course,
the most famous pigment,

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.930
but it's not the only pigment
that photosynthetic organisms

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:39.740
used.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.820
So they also use other pigments
to absorb visible light.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.660
And so there is a class
of pigments that look

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.910
very similar to chlorophyll.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.200
You can look up the
structures if you want.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.630
They're called phytobilins.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:58.610
They're also tetrapyrroles,
very similar to chlorophyll,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:05.690
except, for instance,
pheophytin does not

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.820
contain any magnesium or other
thing conjugated in the center,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.430
so no magnesium.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.503
Otherwise, it looks
similar to chlorophyll.

00:28:15.503 --> 00:28:16.670
And then there's other ones.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:28.930
There's so-called phycoerythrin,
which you might guess is red.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.540
So that's a red pigment.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:37.670
There's phycocyanin,
which is, you might guess,

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:43.400
is a blue pigment.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.910
And then maybe the most
famous one that about that's

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.570
not chlorophyll are the
so-called carotenoids.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.950
This includes things
like beta-carotene.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.110
I think we all know that
beta-carotene is orange.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.750
What does beta-carotene
look like?

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.870
I'll draw it out for you.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.760
There's beta-carotene, another
long conjugated, double bond

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.528
system.

00:29:44.528 --> 00:29:46.070
Obviously, you don't
need to memorize

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.050
the structures of any of these.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.750
You can always look up
structures of these pigments.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:56.780
The point is that nature has
a variety of these structures,

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.940
all with conjugated
double bond systems,

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.050
all well-tuned to
absorb visible light.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:08.510
And this, of course, also
then becomes a major pigment

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.560
for our visual
system, repurposed

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.040
from the plant using it
for chlorosynthesis--

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.870
for photosynthesis.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.580
And why have all these pigments?

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.970
Well, the idea is
because if we say here,

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.960
what's the absorbance then
across the electromagnetic

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.530
spectrum, that the purple,
the short wavelength,

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.160
being down here, and the
red, the long wavelength,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.860
being on this end,
well now, effectively,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.770
you have chlorophylls
that cover that spectrum.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:48.410
And so you'll have
some peak here

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:55.610
for say A type chlorophylls.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:01.610
And then you'll have some other
peak for B type chlorophylls.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.900
These are obviously approximate.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.650
And so that's basically the
A and B type chlorophylls.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.820
Why are plants green?

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.630
Because they absorb in two
peaks on either end, and so that

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.720
reflects the green
light in the middle.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.400
But now you have
these other pigments

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.700
that will fill in the middle.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.960
And so the beta-carotene,
the orange beta-carotene,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.055
will allow you to--

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.640
plants, they'll have an
absorption spectrum that will

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.500
peak somewhere in that range.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.250
And then you'll have
the phycoerythrins

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.750
with an absorption spectrum
that will peak somewhere

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.200
in that range.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.270
And then the phycocyanins
with an absorption spectrum

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.680
that will peak
somewhere in that range.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.900
And basically, by covering all
of these different pigments,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.510
plants and other
photosynthetic organisms

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.780
can now adapt to
different light niches

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:06.240
within the natural world, really
capturing the full spectrum

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.710
of visible light.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.600
And the nice thing
is this also leads

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.570
to all the beautiful
colors and whatnot

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.720
that exists across
photosynthetic organisms,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.930
different plants, algaes, and
bacteria, all different colors.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.950
And basically will use
these different pigments

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.960
to ultimately cover this visual
spectrum, this right spectrum

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.410
with the right amount
of energy to carry out

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.910
the processes that's necessary
to run the light reactions

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.000
of photosynthesis.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.520
Now, even though there's
this variety of pigments,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.035
effectively, all photosynthetic
organisms, as far as we know,

00:32:49.035 --> 00:32:52.830
work in a very similar
way, in that they basically

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.940
arrange these pigments
always at a membrane,

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.650
always here at this thylakoid
membrane in the chloroplast--

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.730
or, I guess it would be the
cell membrane of a prokaryote.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.840
And these are organized
into a structure called

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.985
the light harvesting complex.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.660
And basically, what a
light harvesting complex

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:27.000
is, is it's pigments arranged
in a structure that basically

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.590
can channel energy from
the photons captured down

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.780
into a place called
the reaction center.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.870
So you can imagine that you'd
have all kinds of pigments

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:48.300
arranged in a way that basically
will absorb photons, release

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.690
photons as fluorescence,
ultimately going down

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.390
to this reaction center.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.810
And it's in the reaction
center that really the magic

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.880
of photosynthesis happens.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.740
So what happens at
the reaction center

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.280
is pretty well understood
from the structure

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.920
of the photosynthetic
reaction center that

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:18.600
was solved about 30 years ago
in the purple photosynthetic

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.650
bacteria.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.570
And this is very illustrative
for how it works.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.500
And so if you look
here at the slide,

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.920
this here is basically a
graphical representation

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.230
of what that reaction
center looks like.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.880
And so effectively,
you have a bunch

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.600
of, in this particular
case, molecules up here.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.770
But really, the reaction center
is what exists down here.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.642
And in there, there is
a pair of chlorophylls--

00:34:46.642 --> 00:34:47.850
we'll talk about in a second.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.460
Those are they're shown
graphically over here.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.610
And they will effectively
transfer electrons

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:59.860
around in this direction to
these quinones further away

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.020
from the special
pair of chlorophyll.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.290
So electrons will be
transferred from the chlorophyll

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.720
after it's excited
down to these quinones,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.860
creating a charged separation
that ultimately is going

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.100
to allow you to then have
a high-energy electron that

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.620
can be built into an
electron transport chain.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.850
And so let's draw that
graphically out over here.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:28.640
And so here if we have our
special pair of chlorophylls--

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.970
so chlorophyll, if
you look at it here,

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.650
is relatively a pyrrole.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.770
Like heme, it's a flat
molecule, and so these will

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.610
stack on top of each other.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.770
So if they're stacked
on top of each other

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.010
and this is looking
at them head on,

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.340
you have this special
pair of chlorophylls.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.910
You'll eventually-- you'll
absorb a photon of light,

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:55.610
and that will create
a charge separation

00:35:55.610 --> 00:36:00.560
a cross between that special
pair of chlorophylls.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.060
That electron, before it
can decay as fluorescence,

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.400
as would normally happen, it's
very rapidly transferred out

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.370
to a pheophytin molecule.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:20.150
And then it's very
rapidly transferred again

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.230
to a quinone called QA.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:28.230
All right, so just show
that again here on here.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.480
So here's our special pair.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.020
You absorb a photon of
light, charge separation

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.680
at the special pair, electron
transfer to the pheophytin,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.630
and then down to this quinone.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.333
And that's a very fast reaction.

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.750
And you can see
that it's actually

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:50.550
moving within space that's
roughly the distance from one

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.780
side of the membrane to another.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.730
So on an atomic level,
quite a long distance.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.820
And so from this
quinone, it then

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.980
will be transferred again
to a second quinone.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.370
That's a slower step.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.790
I want to remind
you how electrons

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.530
are transferred on quinones.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.500
And so we talked
about this already

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.080
when we talked about
electron transport.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.470
So here is a--

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.880
so this here would be
an oxidized quinone

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.350
just like we saw for
coenzyme Q, ubiquinone.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.850
So this would be oxidized
quinone and photosynthesis.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:44.810
Electron, you can pick up
electrons one at a time,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:55.040
so that will generate
this semiquinone.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.710
Remember, with the
stabilized free radical,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.120
now you can pick up
a second electron.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:08.510
And that ultimately generates
the reduced, the fully reduced

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.100
quinone, the quinol.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.480
We talked about
this with coenzyme Q

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.530
and oxidative phosphorylation.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.510
Remember, ubiquinone
to ubiquinol,

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.360
similar thing happening
in photosynthesis.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.080
Also, a quinone can pick up
electrons, go from the oxidized

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.430
to the reduced state.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.360
And if you remember, in
oxidative phosphorylation,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.760
you could then, as you
transfer the electrons

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.930
across from the oxidized and
reduced state of the quinones,

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.790
you'll pick up a proton.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.607
If you pick up those protons
and release those protons

00:38:46.607 --> 00:38:48.440
as you transfer electrons
on different sides

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.330
of the membrane,
that can be coupled

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.210
to pump protons
across the membrane

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:57.920
as you transfer electrons
across the system, exactly what

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.230
happens here in photosynthesis.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.300
Except now that
electron is basically

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.867
coming from transfer
of an excited

00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:06.950
electron from the special
pair to the pheophytins,

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.960
and ultimately to the quinones.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.350
And then from the quinones,
can now be transferred down

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.930
on electron transport chain.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:21.430
To show this in a quantum
way, if you will--

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:33.870
so if this here is the
special pair of chlorophyll

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.690
and we draw here the
pair of electrons

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.710
in the special pair
in the ground state,

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.810
if you get a photon of
light of the right energy,

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.160
you excite one of
those electrons

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.460
here into a higher orbital.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:02.570
Before that can decay, if we
transfer that electron out,

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:06.320
basically take that electron
and transfer it out,

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.740
and instead here give
it to the pheophytin--

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:19.970
so here's some orbital in
the pheophytin-- it comes,

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.960
it picks up this electron
that's transferred away

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.990
from the special pair.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.320
Well, now, what you
have is you basically

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:42.330
have a negative charge
here and a positive charge

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.590
up on the special pair.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.340
So you've created this
charge separation.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.670
That electron can then be
further transferred down

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:57.320
the electron transport
chain to the quinones, that

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.790
then transfer them
across the quinones, who

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.060
are pumping proton.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.770
And ultimately, down an
electron transport chain,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.980
ultimately with the final
electron acceptor being

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.530
in NADP+ to make NADPH.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:24.830
And you're still left
with this positive charge

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.840
on the special pair.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.030
Obviously, that's not
a very stable state,

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.240
so we've got to resolve that.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.110
How can that be resolved?

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.640
Well, lots of things will--
that's a pretty good electron

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.420
acceptor.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.740
And so now, even
something like water,

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.440
which is highly abundant,
can be an electron donor,

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.110
and ultimately fixes
that positive charge

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.520
on the special pair by taking
electron from water, which,

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.580
of course, generates oxygen.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.580
This part of the reaction is
carried out by a complex called

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:15.290
the water splitting complex-
We: don't have time to get

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.000
into this--

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.450
and some
manganese-containing enzyme.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.890
And it basically
controls the transfer

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:29.660
of an electron from water
to oxygen, which, hopefully,

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.440
is at least intuitively you'll
see why that's favorable,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.620
because you really have
this true positive charge

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.550
on the special pair.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.210
And almost anything is
a good electron donor

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.720
to that, including water.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:50.180
And so it's really this charge
separation by fast electron

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.820
transfer through
the reaction center

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.100
from the special
chlorophyll pair

00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:00.380
ultimately down to quinones that
creates this charged separation

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.830
that is ultimately where you
can pull an electron from water

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.700
to generate oxygen. And
if we come back over here,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:13.250
it's how we made this whole
process work, how we made water

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.810
on a good electron donor.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.700
That is, we didn't make
the standard-- didn't

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.740
change the standard
reduction potential

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.410
of the oxygen-water pair.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.680
Instead, what we
did is we basically

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.320
used light to excite an
electron in chlorophyll such

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.080
that that excited
electron now can

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.110
be favorably-- sits at a low
enough standard reduction

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.810
potential such that it's
favorable to transfer

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.400
it to NADPH.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.870
And then we fix that
charge hole, if you will,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.410
by pulling an
electron from water,

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.970
and that generates oxygen.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.600
Of course, once we're able to
get this favorable electron

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.090
transfer, now we can couple
that to the pumping of protons.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.340
That allows us to make
delta psi, delta pH.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.850
We charge a battery,
and that does work,

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.570
just like we saw before.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:16.520
So why these concepts were
so important to understanding

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.760
how energy transduction and
biological systems work,

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.070
and why I spent so
much time talking

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.200
about standard
reduction potentials,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.900
delta psi, delta pH, et cetera.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.770
Now, I want to
describe these concepts

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:38.390
and build them into the context
of a chloroplast electron

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:39.800
transport chain.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.760
I'm going to show you what
happens in chloroplasts

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.590
in higher plants.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.600
Conceptually, even though
the details may not

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.870
be 100% the same across all
photosynthetic organisms,

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.910
conceptually what
I'm going to show you

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.640
is exactly the
same, regardless of

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.830
whether it's a
photosynthetic bacteria

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:03.210
or a chloroplast from a plant.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.770
So if we draw here--

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.220
this here being the
thylakoid membrane--

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.450
so I'm going to draw it such
that this here is the stroma

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.320
side of the membrane.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.120
This is the lumen
side of the membrane.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.100
Remember, the
stroma side would be

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.560
equivalent to the matrix of the
mitochondria, where the lumen

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.940
side would be equivalent
to the intermembrane space

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.200
of the mitochondria.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.890
So thylakoid membrane,
stroma side, lumen side.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.670
We have a complex here.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:46:07.340
This complex is
called photosystem II,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.190
abbreviate PSII.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:15.470
Photosystem II is
going to be linked up

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:21.470
to the water splitting complex,
which will basically pick up

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:29.920
an electron, of course,
injecting light that

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:38.090
will transfer electrons
through effectively

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:42.590
what is a Q cycle, what
we alluded to happens

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.120
in oxidative phosphorylation--

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.030
I didn't have time to
describe it in great detail--

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.890
that can pump protons
across the membrane,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:58.080
as electrons are transferred
into the next complex, which

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:03.030
is called cytochrome bf.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:09.120
The next complex,
cytochrome bf, also

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:13.180
can pump protons
across the membrane.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:17.920
Those electrons
then get transferred

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:24.640
to a soluble protein in the
lumen called plastocyanin.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.930
From there, those
electrons now get

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:43.270
transferred to another complex
called photosystem I, or PSI.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:48:00.960
Electrons in photosystem I
can end up in another complex

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:12.210
called ferredoxin, ultimately
transferring those electrons

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:17.730
to NADP+ to generate NADPH.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.980
And of course, that
will happen here

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.150
on the stromal side
of the membrane,

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.250
because that's where
the dark reactions are

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.630
going to take place.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:34.070
This has the effective
generating a delta psi,

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:40.640
delta pH across the membrane.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.270
And of course, that
can be used then,

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:56.110
that delta psi, delta pH can
be used by a chloroplast F0,

00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:03.690
chloroplast F1 to
generate ATP, just

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:11.710
like we described from
oxidative phosphorylation,

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:16.180
with the ATP also being
generated on the stromal side

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.110
of the membrane.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.440
So this should look
very similar to what

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.860
we described for mitochondrial
electron transport.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:29.800
So you see we have multiple
complexes, including

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.490
a cytochrome C-like protein
that sits on, in this case,

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.110
the lumen side of the thylakoid
membrane, plastocyanin.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.360
Cytochrome C sits in
the intermembrane space

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.920
of the mitochondria.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.370
You transfer electrons,
including via Q,

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.970
quinone-like, cycle
that pumps protons,

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.760
have other complexes
that pump protons,

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:57.640
ultimately transfer
electrons to generate NADPH.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:04.240
There's two complexes here that
absorb light, photosystem II

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.440
and photosystem I. Electron
transfer, I guess, classically,

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.430
would go photosystem II,
cytochrome bf, plastocyanin,

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.310
photosystem I, ferredoxin.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:20.510
Water is the donor,
NADPH as the acceptor,

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.580
generates delta psi, delta pH.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.800
That delta psi,
delta pH can then

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.450
be used to do work, including
synthesis of ATP, as done

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:35.020
by an F0F1-ATPase, just like
exists in the mitochondria.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.910
Of course, this evolved first.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.410
And so oxidative phosphorylation
looks like photosynthesis,

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.260
even though we talked about
it, oxidative phosphorylation

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.070
first and then photosynthesis.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:50.110
So you will, of course, looks
like oxidative phosphorylation,

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:52.570
but, of course,
remember, it's really

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.420
not that photosynthesis looks
like oxidative phosphorylation,

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.130
it's that oxidative
phosphorylation looks

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:00.070
like photosynthesis.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.210
Now ultimately, the reason this
works is because photosystem II

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:10.690
and photosystem I can absorb
photons, which ultimately,

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.660
by the processes we discussed,
is what makes electron transfer

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:20.085
favorable from water to NADP+
to generate oxygen and NADPH.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.240
Now, I want to take
you through just

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.120
to show you how this
works, because it turns out

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.640
it's also possible
to short circuit

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.210
this in a way that can
favor more delta psi,

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:38.030
delta pH production relative
to NADPH production,

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.390
which is important,
because you can imagine

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:44.200
that a photosynthetic
organism has to balance

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.850
its needs for NADPH and ATP--

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:51.130
both useful molecules,
but you want

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.270
to balance your needs
for both of them.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.700
And it turns out that this
middle part, photosystem I,

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.480
works with cytochrome
bf in a way that

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.790
allows it to balance that.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:53.040
So if I draw this out in
a little bit more detail--

00:52:53.040 --> 00:53:00.545
so here's negative 1.6 volts
and here's positive 0.8 volts.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:16.940
So that's, again, our
standard reduction potential.

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:23.830
So remember, water and oxygen
is going to sit down here.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:27.120
You're going to have
in photosystem I

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.240
a special pair called P680.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.630
That's the wavelength of light.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.100
At the special pair in--

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.695
so this here would
be photosystem--

00:53:45.695 --> 00:53:47.480
sorry, photosystem II.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:54.680
That's a special pair within
photosystem II, absorbs photon.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:02.030
That photon now becomes
an excited electron

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.280
that can be transferred away.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.570
That ultimately makes
water a good electron donor

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.060
to resolve that
charge separation

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.800
at this special pair.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.760
That electron is ultimately
transferred away, coming down

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.390
here to cytochrome bf.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:26.640
So this moves from a higher
to a lower standard reduction

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.940
potential that's favorable.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:35.820
So this should go here through
the pheophytin, QA, QB, et

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.690
cetera, through a
Q-like cycle to get

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.260
to cytochrome bf
and pump a proton.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:48.600
That would then transfer
to plastocyanin.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:56.660
That would then transfer,
ultimately, to photosystem I.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:07.310
So there's photosystem I,
which also can absorb a photon,

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:16.400
excite that electron, which can
be rapidly transferred away.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.670
But this time, rather than
water being the electron donor,

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.750
it's the electron transfer
from plastocyanin that resolves

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:27.980
the charged separation on the
special pair as you excite

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:33.470
and transfer the electrons
out, ultimately coming here

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:43.460
to ferredoxin, which is at
the right standard reduction

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:51.820
potential to reduce
NADP+ to NADPH.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:58.030
And so this here also would
come through quinones.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:01.590
A0, A1 is what those quinones
are called in photosystem

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.590
I. That's not important.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:05.560
It's exactly the same thing
as what we described before.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.640
And ultimately, this is
drawing out, basically,

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.950
what happens in the
chloroplasts, how photosystem

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:15.940
II and photosystem I fit in
with electron transfer in terms

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.220
of moving across standard
reduction potentials.

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.710
Now, what's cool is
that photosystem I,

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.600
rather than transferring
the electrons to make NADPH,

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:34.750
also can instead transfer
electrons as an alternative

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:38.170
back to cytochrome bf.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.050
Well, if it comes back
into cytochrome bf,

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.360
you can see that
basically this now

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.560
creates a loop where you have
favorable electron transfer

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.920
here, excite, favorable
electron transfer, excite,

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.990
favorable electron transfer.

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:58.690
In essence, this here
will then pump a proton

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.530
by basically transferring
the electron back,

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:07.420
allowing you to run this
middle part between photosystem

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.950
I, cytochrome bf, and
plastocyanin, create delta psi,

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.840
delta pH at cytochrome bf.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:19.010
And that allows you to make
ATP without generating NADPH,

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:21.610
or make a battery,
delta psi, delta pH,

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:26.860
do whatever work without
generating NADPH.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.270
That's also shown here
on this slide, drawn out

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:34.420
in a way that may be
slightly neater than what

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.960
I drew out over there, but
effectively illustrates

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:38.680
the same thing.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.280
And it's cool that
there's this flexibility

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.790
to run photosynthesis in a
way that you can net generate

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:51.070
NADPH, but you can also generate
just delta psi, delta pH,

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.520
allowing the plant to
meet its energetic needs,

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.510
because delta psi, delta pH
can keep ATP-ADP ratio high

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.070
when the lights are on.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.590
And then that way, the
plant has all the energy

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:08.060
it needs to fight entropy
and be alive as a cell.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.450
Whereas, it can also tune it,
then, to generate the NADPH

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:14.090
it needs to make reduced
carbon that it can then

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:17.530
store for later.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:21.820
Now, to make the reduced carbon
that can be stored for later,

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:27.100
ultimately, now we have to
basically take CO2 and turn it

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.725
into carbohydrate,
turn it into glucose.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:41.410
This CO2 into carbohydrate,
turning it into glucose,

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:44.560
that hexo-sugar that the
plant can then pack away with

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:50.140
alpha-1,4 linkages as starch to
burn later when the lights are

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.260
off, requires reduction.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.930
That reduction electrons
have to come from somewhere.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:59:01.280
Well, ultimately, they can
come from water via NADPH.

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.660
And those are the dark
reactions of photosynthesis.

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:08.020
And so let's discuss those next.

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.300
And so the dark
reactions, really,

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:28.760
are CO2 plus NADPH going
to carbohydrate plus NADP+.

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.750
These are reactions
that can happen either

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.700
in the dark or the light.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.270
They're unique to
photosynthetic organisms.

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:47.750
That's who can net
carry out this reaction,

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:52.190
fixing carbon as glucose, as
reduced carbon and glucose.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.890
These reactions,
these dark reactions,

00:59:54.890 --> 01:00:01.370
are going to occur here in
the stroma of the chloroplast.

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.930
And why is that useful?

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.440
Because this is where the
NADPH and the ATP that's

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.370
going to be required for these
dark reactions to take place.

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.280
It should be clear to you,
NADPH is the electron donor,

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.770
but you also need
additional energy input

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.370
because this is effectively
reversing glucose oxidation.

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.632
That releases energy,
need energy input,

01:00:21.632 --> 01:00:23.090
and so you're going
to see you also

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:27.920
need ATP to ADP conversion.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.190
By happening in the
stroma, you have the place

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.430
where the NADPH and ATP is
being produced as products

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:37.180
of the light reaction.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:40.120
So these dark reactions
of photosynthesis

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.200
were discovered in the
1950s by a gentleman

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.630
by the name of Melvin Calvin.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:50.830
As a result, sometimes
the dark reactions

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:55.390
are referred to as
the Calvin cycle

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.030
to honor him as the discoverer.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:02.980
And basically, the experiment
that Calvin did is he took

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:06.830
carbon dioxide that was labeled
with radioactive carbon--

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.670
so C14 carbon dioxide--

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:14.350
he basically fed it to
a photosynthetic algae

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:17.530
and found that the
first compound that

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:23.180
incorporated the radioactive
CO2 was a 3-carbon compound.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.470
And that 3-carbon compound
was 3-phosphogylcerate.

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:35.480
Good old 3-PG from glycolysis.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.100
And so he found that you could
get these reactions of CO2

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.160
going into 3-phosphoglycerate
is the first thing

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.500
to incorporate the
radioactive carbon.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.450
That worked in the
light or the dark,

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.900
and that's where the term
dark reactions came from.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.500
Now, it should be,
hopefully, clear to you

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.860
that if I can generate
3-phosphoglycerate,

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.570
you now know how
to make glucose.

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.653
Because now you can go
back and look at your notes

01:02:02.653 --> 01:02:04.350
from the
gluconeogenesis lecture,

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:07.020
and if you had a source
of 3-phosphoglycerate,

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:11.430
you can just run it through the
reactions of gluconeogenesis,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:15.850
and ultimately make glucose.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:21.070
Turns out that the way
this happens in total

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:27.670
is the so-called Calvin cycle,
really happens in three phases.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:32.090
So the first phase
is called fixation.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.420
And so what is fixation?

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.550
That's basically
Calvin's experiment.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:44.360
It's using CO2 to generate
3-phosphoglycerate.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.940
The second phase is
referred to as reduction.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.020
So what's reduction?

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.930
Well, that's basically
gluconeogenesis.

01:02:53.930 --> 01:03:00.740
So it's using 3-phosphoglycerate
and turning it into glucose.

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.097
Gluconeogenesis,
we're reducing carbon.

01:03:03.097 --> 01:03:05.180
This is the step, of course,
so you need electrons

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:05.805
from somewhere.

01:03:05.805 --> 01:03:07.347
They're going to
come from NADPH.

01:03:07.347 --> 01:03:08.870
We need NADPH for that.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:11.990
You'll also need ATP.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:17.750
And then the last step
is called regeneration.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:22.190
And what you will see is that
the Calvin cycle is a cycle.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:25.610
That is, you're going to have to
have an entry point and an exit

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.270
point.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:28.790
And just like we talked
about for the TCA cycle,

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:32.510
if we feed two carbon acetyl
CoA units into the TCA cycle,

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:35.840
we have to have an acceptor,
oxaloacetate, in order

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.260
to run the cycle.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.110
And if we pull anything
out of the cycle,

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:42.090
we need another way to add
carbon back to the cycle.

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:48.500
And so regeneration is really
anaplerosis for the cycle.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.260
That is, you need to generate
the acceptor that you can

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.170
keep running this as a cycle.

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.700
As a general overview,
it works as follows.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:07.160
And so it turns out that the
cycle works with this molecule

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.260
as, I guess, if we're going
to draw an analogy to the TCA

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.840
cycle, where oxaloacetate
was the initial acceptor,

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.930
this is the analogous
molecule to that.

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:23.450
This is a molecule,
it's a 5-carbon sugar.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:26.180
So it's pentose
phosphorylated-- it's

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.450
a pentose and a
ketose phosphorylated

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:32.010
on the one and
the five position.

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:40.140
So this is ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate,

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.100
which I will abbreviate R15P.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:53.640
So ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
will pick up a CO2 molecule,

01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:07.530
and it will make two
3-phosphoglycerate molecules.

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:10.560
So five carbons plus one
carbon equals six carbons.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.640
Break them in half, two
3-phosphoglycerate molecules.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.280
Once you have that
3-phosphoglycerate,

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:25.740
I can now use ATP
to phosphorylate

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.660
that 3-phosphoglycerate.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.780
That'll give me
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:41.440
I can now run the photosynthetic
version of the GAPDH reaction,

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.390
which is exactly the
reaction that you

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.100
saw in glycolysis,
except now we're

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:49.420
going to use NADPH
rather than NADH,

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.660
as we described for glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.790
And so that's going to
give me glyceraldehyde

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:04.050
3-phosphate,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.030
use triose-phosphate
isomerase to make

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:08.770
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:14.752
And I can run aldolase
reaction to make fructose

01:06:14.752 --> 01:06:19.325
1,6-bisphosphate, can release
a phosphate from fructose

01:06:19.325 --> 01:06:20.610
1,6-bisphosphate.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.020
Now I have fructose 6-phosphate.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.170
I can isomerize
fructose 6-phosphate

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:30.660
to glucose 6-phosphate.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.173
And of course, if I take the
phosphate off, that's glucose.

01:06:34.173 --> 01:06:36.090
Or, more importantly,
what would the plant do?

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.670
It would then do
a mutase reaction

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:42.960
to make glucose 1-phosphate
and pack that away in starch,

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.740
much like we discussed for
putting glucose into glycogen.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.720
And then get that
glucose back out

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.850
as glucose 1-phosphate,
glucose 6-phosphate,

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:56.160
and send it to glycolysis to
be oxidized to get energy.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.790
This is great, but you can see
that this is not going to work

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:05.600
unless I can regenerate a source
of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.270
Turns out, you can do that
from fructose 6-phosphate.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:12.840
Obviously, ATP is going
to be required here, too,

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.970
because there's only
one phosphate here.

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:20.100
You need two phosphates for
the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.810
So more ATP is needed.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:30.720
And ultimately, that, in
a non-stoichiometric way,

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.100
is how the cycle works.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:46.000
And so if we break this up
then into the different phases,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.030
this phase up here
would be fixation,

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:57.340
this phase down
here is reduction,

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.500
and this phase over
here is regeneration.

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:09.862
And that's basically
the Calvin cycle.

01:08:09.862 --> 01:08:11.570
Let's go through these
now one at a time.

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:13.225
Let's first talk about fixation.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:25.370
Fixation is catalyzed by
an enzyme called RuBisCO,

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:32.850
which stands for
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:34.824
carboxylase-oxygenase.

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:45.620
So RuBisCO, if you
want a bit of trivia,

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.170
is the most abundant
enzyme on earth.

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:52.250
It's about 50% of the
protein in chloroplasts.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.950
It's an incredibly
inefficient enzyme.

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.750
It has a turnover number
about three per second.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:00.800
And that's why it's so abundant,
because it's a crappy enzyme.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.319
And so therefore, it needs
to have a lot of it around

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.670
in order to work.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.640
It evolved in a
pre-oxygen atmosphere,

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.029
and now, of course, there's lots
of oxygen in the atmosphere.

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.760
And CO2 and oxygen
will both compete

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.420
to react with the enzyme.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.680
And it turns out that that's
a issue for photosynthesis,

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.720
and it's a big deal
for agriculture.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.630
Now, the way RuBisCO
works is that there

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:31.840
is a lysine in the active
site of the enzyme.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:39.100
And that lysine is covalently
bound to a CO2 molecule.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.130
And that CO2 molecule
covalently bound to the lysine

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:43.497
is not involved in the reaction.

01:09:43.497 --> 01:09:45.580
But basically, if you don't
have enough CO2 around

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.550
to carboxylate the
lysine, now you

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.050
can't carry out the reaction.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.689
It's one way to
ensure that there's

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.730
enough CO2 that this will work.

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:58.660
But effectively, what that CO2
does is coordinates a magnesium

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:06.325
atom that ultimately coordinates
and positions the ribulose

01:10:06.325 --> 01:10:14.440
1,5-bisphosphate within the
active site of the enzyme.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.880
So here is ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate bound

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.840
into the active site of RuBisCO.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.320
I'll show you quickly how
the RuBisCO reaction works.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:45.340
And so if we take the enol--

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:53.060
or, the keto form of ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate and redraw it

01:10:53.060 --> 01:11:13.240
in the active site as
the keto form so it's--

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.300
that will react with CO2.

01:11:59.925 --> 01:12:00.790
You add water.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:49.320
And then ultimately, what we
are left with from the top half

01:12:49.320 --> 01:13:04.160
of the molecule, we get this
1,3-phosphoglycerate molecule,

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:17.010
and on the bottom part also get
a 3-phosphoglycerate molecule.

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:23.840
So two 3-phosphoglycerates
generated.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.330
So ultimately, what's happening
is we're adding a CO2 basically

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:37.540
between the two and three carbon
of ribulose 1,5-bisphophate,

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.650
breaking the molecule in half
to get two 3-phosphoglycerate

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.460
molecules.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:49.640
Just to quickly show you
what happens if at this step

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:58.610
if you instead replace this with
oxygen, so instead have oxygen

01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:00.170
add there instead.

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.170
Well, now you end up
with this situation.

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.480
So now you have that instead.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:41.330
Now, when water gets
added, you end up

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:48.040
generating from the bottom
half of the molecule,

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.380
of course, a 3-phosphoglycerate.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.940
So that's not a problem.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.770
But from the top
half of the molecule,

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.200
rather than generating a
3-phosphoglycerate, now

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:11.440
you have this
2-carbon unit, which

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.775
is called phosphoglycolate.

01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:24.150
And it turns out that
phosphoglycolate is not

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.760
a good thing for
the plant to have.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.565
You basically started
with 5-carbon ribulose

01:15:30.565 --> 01:15:35.550
1,5-bisphosphate, and you end
up with 3-phosphoglycerate

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:39.300
and a 2-carbon phosphoglycolate.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.840
No carbon is added
there, and now the plant

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.810
has to deal with the
phosphoglycolate.

01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:49.230
So it has to regenerate the
ribulose 1,5-bisphophate.

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.230
So naturally, if
you're going to take--

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:54.840
rebuild that 5-carbon
molecule, that's

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.740
going to require energy input.

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.920
And you haven't fixed a CO2.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.320
So in the end, what's required
is actually more ATP and NADPH

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.370
to solve the
phosphoglycolate problem

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.560
with no net gain for the plant.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.190
And so as a result, oxygen
competing with carbon dioxide

01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:22.020
is a big deal for plants.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:25.020
By the way, dealing with
phosphoglycolate-- which,

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.940
of course, plants
have a way to do--

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.370
is a process called
photorespiration.

01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:33.720
Photorespiration requires
all this ATP and NADPH,

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.670
so it requires all
this extra light energy

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:37.800
from the plant that's
really not being

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.900
used for any good purpose
for the plant itself.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.690
Now, the process I described
is the standard photosynthesis

01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:54.420
process, and it's what happens
in so-called C3 plants, called

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.170
C3 because a 3-carbon
intermediate is made.

01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:01.800
It turns out that there
is also a class of plants

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:07.200
called C4 plants that basically
use a 4-carbon intermediate.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.060
They do the same
thing 3 plants do,

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.120
but they basically have
a system that basically

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.920
uses some extra ATP
and NADPH in order

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.050
to generate a shuttle
to concentrate

01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:26.400
CO2 to run the RuBisCO
reaction that I just showed.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.660
And so that is shown
here on this slide.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.350
And so this is what
happens in C4 plants.

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:36.180
And so effectively,
you fix a CO2 using--

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.680
basically, making oxaloacetate.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.350
So that's the 4-carbon unit.

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:44.670
You run an NADPH-driven version
of the malate dehydrogenase

01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:47.040
reaction to ultimately
generate malate.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.320
And then turn that malate
back into pyruvate,

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.400
releasing CO2 back over here
into the different parts.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.980
So use a PEPCK-like
reaction, send it

01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.240
to the chloroplast,
where you then regenerate

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.580
CO2 for the RuBisCO enzyme.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.980
And you send that
pyruvate back out as a way

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:09.450
to run a cycle that basically
concentrates the CO2.

01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:14.460
So this requires extra
ATP, requires extra NADPH.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.260
But in the end,
it saves the plant

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:19.920
the trouble of having to deal
with this phosphoglycolate.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.780
Not surprisingly,
this has evolved

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.100
in places with high light.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.160
So tropical plants are
more likely to be C4 plants

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.210
because they have more
light around, more ATP,

01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:33.300
NADPH any way, that allows
them to compete with each other

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.360
and concentrate CO2 in
a way that allows them

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.200
to run the RuBisCO reaction.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.900
All right, reduction,
the next phase up here.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.020
There's actually
not a lot to say.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:52.230
This is basically just
gluconeogenesis using NADPH.

01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:55.080
And of course, you can use
it to generate glucose,

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.410
but plants would rather
generate glucose 1-phosphate

01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:00.930
and store it as
starch or something

01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:05.470
else, some storage sugar
for the plant itself.

01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:11.200
Now, what should be clear
to you is that, well, we

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.680
started with a 5-carbon unit
and we added a 1-carbon unit.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:23.390
And in the end, if we're going
to net generate a glucose,

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:27.410
we're going to have to run that
cycle six times, because we

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:30.170
need a 5-carbon unit
to come out the end,

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:36.230
as well as build a 6-carbon
unit just from CO2.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:44.630
And so regeneration is really
how do we go from net six CO2

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.570
to one glucose molecule.

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:52.910
That is, how can we combine
that reduction step while also

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:57.950
regenerating ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate to keep

01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:00.820
running this as a cycle?

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:07.540
And so, in essence, what we need
is we need to take six 5-carbon

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.370
units--

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:13.035
so that's a total of 30 carbons.

01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:19.980
And we're going to
have 6x CO2 molecules.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.820
There's another six carbons.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:29.473
So that's a total
of 36 carbons in.

01:20:29.473 --> 01:20:31.140
And then we're going
to have to allocate

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.240
those carbons to regenerate
six 5-carbon units.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:43.560
So the 30 carbons, we need
it for the cycle, as well as

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:49.290
one glucose, the remaining
six carbons, that hexose.

01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.430
How this happens is confusing.

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.050
I'm sorry, I didn't invent this.

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:58.390
Nature invented this.

01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:02.860
But it's essentially
accomplished via series

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:06.970
of 2-carbon and 3-carbon swaps.

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:10.720
And why it's 2-carbon and
3-carbon swaps and not--

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.880
I don't know, why didn't
nature just come up

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.620
with something more
straightforward

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.500
is well grounded in
the chemistry of how

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.670
these reactions happen.

01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:22.000
We'll describe the chemistry
of the swapping reactions

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.920
in great detail next time.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.210
You'll see that the swaps occur
between aldosis and ketosis.

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:32.592
And so there's actually
good evolutionary reasons.

01:21:32.592 --> 01:21:35.050
You'll see that those reactions
will be analogous to things

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:36.700
that we've seen before.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.150
And effectively, nature,
rather than making it easy

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:42.190
for you to memorize
things, came up

01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:45.670
with a way that
actually fit what

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:48.490
happens that enables carbon
rearrangement in a way that

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:51.730
will make this pathway work.

01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:58.090
And so before I go into the
details of exactly how this

01:21:58.090 --> 01:22:00.550
happens, I just want
to lay out for you

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:06.340
at a very, very high
level how those swaps can

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:09.850
work to accomplish this goal.

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:21.640
So basically, If we're going
to start with five carbons

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:27.840
and we're going to add CO2,
what's that going to generate?

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.560
Well, we're going to generate,
by the RuBisCO reaction,

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.730
3-carbon units.

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:40.020
So if I start with 6 of
these and 6 of these,

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:46.390
I can generate 12
3-carbon units.

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:50.650
I can take of those
12 3-carbon units

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:54.360
and obviously combine
them via the reduction

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.020
reactions, gluconeogenesis,
ways to generate 6-carbon units.

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:06.550
And that ultimately is going to
be the glucose that I get out.

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:11.290
So it turns out if I do
this reaction five times--

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.590
so that's 10 3-carbon units--

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:16.420
but if I take some
of-- so that means

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:21.520
I'm going to get in the
end five 6-carbon units.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.150
Well, if I use
two of those units

01:23:26.150 --> 01:23:28.820
and I do a swap with
the remaining two

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.440
of these 3-carbon
units-- that is,

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.200
I transfer two carbons
from here to there--

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.170
what am I going to get?

01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:38.850
Well, if I-- that
means two carbons.

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:42.600
6 minus 2 is I get
a 4-carbon unit.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.730
3 plus 2 is a 5-carbon unit.

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:46.020
That's good.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.430
That's what I'm trying to get.

01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:50.040
So I took two there, two here.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.960
So that stoichiometry
adds up here.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.700
I had 12 of these made.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.280
5 plus 5 plus 2
equals 10, 5 of them

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.730
down here to these
guys, 2 of them

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.990
with this swap with
the 3-carbon units.

01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:06.810
Now I end up getting two
of the six 5-carbon units

01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:08.460
that I need to make.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:11.760
Well, now I'm left here
with two 4-carbon units.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.720
I steal here.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.450
I took one away
here, two away there.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.750
5 minus 2 minus 1 is
2 left, so I still

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:22.800
have two 2-carbon
units here to go.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.890
So I can use my
remaining 2-carbon units

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:31.080
to react with those
4-carbon units.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:38.490
If I now move three carbons from
here to there, 6 minus 3 is 3,

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:40.590
4 plus 3 is 7.

01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:46.260
Now I generate a 7-carbon unit,
two of these, two of these.

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.990
Now, if I take two carbons
from my 7-carbon unit,

01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:51.690
give it to the 3-carbon
unit, what do I have?

01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.550
Well, now I have--

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:56.985
I've made two different
5-carbon units.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:07.300
So 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals
6 5-carbon units back.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.710
So it can work.

01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:16.490
I will end today by drawing out
the details of how it works.

01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:18.550
And then I will
redraw them next time,

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:23.320
and we'll go through in
great detail how it works.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:44.490
So let's start here with our
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate,

01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:46.980
carry out the RuBisCO reaction.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.730
I get two 3PG molecules.

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:59.760
I can run those 3PG molecules
using ATP and NADPH,

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:19.200
ultimately to generate
3-phosphoglycerate molecules.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.850
I can isomerize--

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.700
I'm sorry, glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate molecules--

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.480
I can isomerize those
to also generate

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.850
dihydroxyacetone
phosphate molecules.

01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:44.510
And, of course,
this is what I need

01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:58.400
to generate FBP, and ultimately
generate fructose 6-phosphate.

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.550
And that fructose
6-phosphate, of course,

01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:12.160
can be used to generate glucose.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.720
And I'm not going to
draw the steps for it.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:15.430
OK.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.560
All stuff you know.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.100
RuBisCO reaction and then
gluconeogenesis, ultimately,

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.550
to get glucose.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:23.050
OK.

01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:24.633
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

01:27:24.633 --> 01:27:28.960
So now let's use our
fructose 6-phosphate

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.890
and our glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:43.420
So I can generate
a 5-carbon sugar

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:57.820
called xylulose 5-phosphate.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.950
That's a five-carbon sugar.

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:09.160
If I use an epimerase and
phosphorylate it with ATP,

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.604
now I can regenerate a
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:30.990
I've also now will generate
this 4-carbon sugar

01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:38.690
called erythrose 4-phosphate.

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:42.800
And I can take this
erythrose 4-phosphate,

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.290
swap three carbons,
which will give me

01:28:45.290 --> 01:29:09.730
the 7-carbon sugar called
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, as

01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:22.300
well as a 3-carbon
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:26.860
Now I can swap
two carbons again,

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:41.650
and that gives me a ribose
5-phosphate and another--

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:46.360
so this is ribose 5-phosphate--

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:55.200
and another xylulose
5-phosphate.

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:07.670
So X5P, xylulose 5-phosphate.

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:11.510
I can now do exactly the
same thing I did before

01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:13.490
with the xylulose
5-phosphate where

01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:18.760
I do in an epimerase reaction
and phosphorylate it,

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:24.910
so epimerase from the
ribose 5-phosphate.

01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:32.240
I can do and isomerase
reaction and phosphorylate it.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.915
And in the end, I now
generate 5-carbon ribulose

01:30:37.915 --> 01:30:40.170
1,5-bisphosphate.

01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:47.490
So if I start with six ribulose
1,5-bisphosphates and six CO2

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.890
molecules, what
do I end up with?

01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:55.850
Well, now I end up with 12
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.960
If I allocate two of them
here, five of them here,

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.150
and five of them
here, that allows

01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:09.410
me to generate five fructose
6-phosphate molecules.

01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:12.820
If I allocate two of them
there, pull one of them

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.870
out as glucose, and
the remaining two here,

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:22.645
I get two of these and two of
these, can carry this through.

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:24.020
Two of these and
two of those, is

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.940
two of these and two of those,
two of these and two of those,

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.980
so I end up with
two here, two here.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:32.660
That's two, four, six 5-carbon
units ending up as ribulose

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.290
1,5-bisphosphate.

01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:39.230
And so I can feed six CO2's
in, get a glucose out,

01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:44.720
and net regenerate six
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphates,

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.710
all at the cost
of six ATPs there,

01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:56.150
another twelve ATPs here to do
the gluconeogenesis reactions,

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:59.270
and another six--

01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:02.360
I'm sorry, twelve
NADPH's to generate

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.170
all of these 3-carbon units.

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:07.743
And in the end, pull out
one glucose molecule.

01:32:07.743 --> 01:32:08.660
We'll start with this.

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:10.490
I know it's very confusing.

01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:11.810
I will redraw that out.

01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:15.420
I'll go through it again at
the start of the next lecture.

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.140
Thank you.

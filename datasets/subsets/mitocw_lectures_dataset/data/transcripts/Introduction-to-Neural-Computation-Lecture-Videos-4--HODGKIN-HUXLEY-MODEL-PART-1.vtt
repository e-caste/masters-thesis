WEBVTT

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.450
MICHALE FEE: Today
we're going to continue

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.620
building our equivalent
circuit model of a neuron.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.380
Again, this is the
Hodgkin-Huxley model,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.380
and the model was
really developed

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
around explaining how neurons
generate action potentials.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840
There are two key
ion channels that are

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.460
associated with making spikes.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.980
There's a sodium
channel that we model

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.260
as a conductance in
series with a battery,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.460
and there's a
potassium conductance

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.960
that we model the same way.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.290
And again, those
two conductances

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.020
cooperate to produce
an action potential.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.580
And we saw, essentially,
how those two conductances,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.460
together with their
batteries-- the sodium battery

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.430
is up at plus 50
or so millivolts.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
The potassium battery is down
at minus 75 or so millivolts.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
And those two conductances then
work to essentially connect

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.300
the inside of the neuron
to the plus battery

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.150
and then to the minus battery
to give you an action potential.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.370
And you may remember that
we saw what that looks like.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.570
So here is plotting
membrane potential in blue.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.360
Here, we turn on this
sodium conductance.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
The voltage of the cell
races up to about plus 55.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.030
Then we turn off the sodium.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.590
We turn on the potassium.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.890
The voltage goes down
to minus 75 or so.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.840
And then we turn off
both conductances,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.260
and the cell recovers.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.310
So you can see that that
basically produces what

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.230
looks like an action potential.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.970
That's the basis of action
potential production.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.470
But in order to understand how
these things turn on and off

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.170
in the time course
that they do, we

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.820
need to understand
a little bit more

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.300
about how these sodium and
potassium conductances work.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.960
And that's what we're
going to focus on today.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.760
So let's just start
building our model.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.560
So each one of those
conductances with a battery

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.090
is associated with a current.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.770
There's a current
that goes through each

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.300
of those conductances.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.260
The total current
through the membrane,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.760
the ionic current through the
membrane in the Hodgkin-Huxley

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.480
model is a sum of three
components, actually--

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.460
a sodium current, a
potassium current--

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.990
those two we just talked about--

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.360
and a leak current that
is just a fixed current.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.610
So the sodium and
potassium currents

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.980
are functions of
time and voltage.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.930
The leak current, the leak
conductance, is just fixed.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.170
And it has a battery of
about minus 50 millivolts.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.800
And it just tends to keep the
cell sort of hyperpolarized.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.340
And these two currents,
these two conductances,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.140
do the job of making
an action potential.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.830
So the total membrane
current is just

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.750
a sum of those three parts.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.800
And now we can just take
that membrane current

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.660
and plug it into this equation
for the voltage as a function

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.200
of current now and solve
that differential equation

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.600
to get the voltage to calculate
how the voltage evolves

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.610
in time in the presence of
these membrane currents.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.190
All right, so you recall
from the last lecture

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.150
that you watched on video
that these currents can be

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.830
written down as a conductance.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.630
So let's just start here.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.600
This is the most
similar one to the one

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.630
that you saw in the
previous lecture.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.880
The current is
just a conductance

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.680
times a driving potential.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.350
And we described
how that equation

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.040
can be summarized in
electrical circuit components

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.870
as a resistor, which is
one over the conductance,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.730
times a driving potential,
which is basically

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.360
just the voltage drop
across the conductance.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.860
Now, each of these conductances,
each of these currents,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.630
is going to be written down
by a very similar equation.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.110
So the potassium current is
just the potassium conductance

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.240
times the driving
potential for potassium,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.310
which is just the membrane
potential minus the Ek.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.580
And the sodium current is
just the sodium conductance

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.050
times the driving
potential for sodium,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.610
which is the membrane potential
minus the sodium battery.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.160
Any questions?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.933
Yes?

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:48.250
AUDIENCE: How did
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.910
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.360
So unless I've made a mistake,
I've tried to put these--

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.880
remember that the
potassium battery is minus,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.680
is negative, right?

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.780
And the sodium
battery is positive.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.760
So I've tried to
show that by putting

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.960
the batteries in the
opposite direction, right?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.780
So the battery
symbol has one side

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.108
that's supposed to
indicate positive voltage,

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:17.400
and the other side is negative.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.140
So because they have
the opposite sign,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.775
I've put them in backwards,
in the opposite direction.

00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:23.650
Does that make sense?

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.860
Don't worry about that too much.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.200
If I ask you to draw
this, I don't really

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.420
care that much which
way these things go.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.660
I just want you to
know that this one is

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.290
negative on the inside
and that the sodium is

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.340
positive on the inside.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.290
This is the inside of
the cell here, right?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.410
The sodium battery
drives the inside

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.510
of the cell toward
positive voltage,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.030
because you have positive
ions flowing into the cell.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.210
So you can see now that
the membrane potential here

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.750
depends on the membrane currents
through this differential

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.500
equation.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.040
But the membrane currents--
the sodium, potassium, and leak

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.580
currents-- all depend on
these conductances, right?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.130
And these conductances for
the sodium and potassium

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.250
are voltage dependent
and time dependent.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.830
So you can see that
the conductances

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.950
depend on the voltage, right?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.825
So the membrane potential
depends on current.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.720
Current depends on conductances,
but the conductances

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.620
depend on the
membrane potential.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.280
So it goes around and
around and around, right?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.980
So those things all
depend on each other.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.250
And so what we are
setting out to do

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.210
is to write down the way those
things depend on each other,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.990
the way you can think about
that system evolving in time.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.360
So let me just show
you what the plan is.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.270
So the plan is to write down
an algorithm-- basically,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.830
a for loop--

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.242
that describes how the neuron
generates an action potential.

00:06:58.242 --> 00:07:00.200
Let me just walk you
through the steps of that,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.050
and then I'll get
to your question.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.520
So we're going to start with
some membrane potential V,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.820
and we're going
to calculate that

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.480
the voltage-dependent parameters
of the sodium and potassium

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.880
conductance using that
membrane potential.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.740
And once we have
those parameters,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.320
we can actually calculate the
conductance for each of those,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.420
for the sodium and potassium.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.810
Once you know the conductance,
you can get the currents.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.280
Once you have the
currents, you can

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.290
compute the total
membrane current, just

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.950
by adding them all together.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.295
Then, you can compute--

00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:41.670
once you have all
those currents,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.620
you just compute V infinity,
which is just the current times

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.410
the resistance, the
effective resistance.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.110
Then we're going to
integrate our first order

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.890
linear differential equation to
get a new voltage as a function

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.170
of time and V infinity.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.940
And we're just going to
go back and start again.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.140
The so that's the
algorithm that a neuron

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.020
uses to generate a spike.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.650
And that's what we're
going to work out.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.690
Now, we've talked
about these things

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.900
over the last few
lectures, how you

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.383
can relate total
current to V infinity

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:22.550
and then integrate a first
order linear differential

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.490
equation, which is just
relaxing exponentially

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.430
toward V infinity.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.250
But now we're going to put
these things in, figure out

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.640
the voltage and time
dependence of the sodium

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.049
and potassium conductances.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.361
Yes?

00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:38.789
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:43.440
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.340
It's primarily potassium.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.640
It has a negative potential.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.100
But it's just constant,
so we're not really

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.290
going to pay much
attention to it.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.250
So if the sodium and
potassium currents are off,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.920
then the leak current still
keeps the cell hyperpolarized.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.190
All right, any questions?

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.140
That's the big picture.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.780
So here are our
learning objectives.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.460
I'd like you to be able to
draw that circuit diagram,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.700
not worrying about the long
and short sides of the battery.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.080
We're going to talk
about how we measure

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.510
the properties of ion channels.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.800
That's called a voltage clamp.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.320
So I want you to be able
to describe what that is.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.600
I'd like you to be able to
plot the voltage and time

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.350
dependence of the potassium
current for today.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.600
The next lecture, we'll talk
about the sodium current,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.382
so we'll add that to our list
of things that we need to know.

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:42.840
But for today, I'd
like you to able

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.560
to plot the voltage and time
dependence of the potassium

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.170
current and conductance.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.350
And be able to
explain, biophysically,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.020
where the time and voltage
dependence of that potassium

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.320
conductance comes from and
be able to write it down

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.130
in terms of quantities
that are called

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.250
the Hodgkin-Huxley
gating variables.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.530
So that's the plan.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.800
All right, so let's come
back to our circuit.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.400
Again, we have a
sodium current that's

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.910
sodium conductance times the
sodium driving potential.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.610
The conductance is voltage
and time dependent.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.350
The equilibrium
potential for sodium,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.960
again, is plus 55 millivolts.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.080
The potassium current is
just potassium conductance

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.120
times the potassium
driving potential.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.790
The driving potential
is reference

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.300
to a battery in equilibrium
potential at minus 75.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.700
And the leak has a battery
at minus 50 millivolts.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.650
So those are the parts
we're going to use.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.130
We're going to describe now
the experiments that Hodgkin

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.180
and Huxley did to extract
the parameters of the sodium

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.860
and potassium conductances.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.010
Today, we're going to focus
on the potassium conductances.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.520
And then on next
Tuesday, I guess,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.790
we're going to do the sodium.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.600
All right, so the reason
Hodgkin and Huxley studied--

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.900
so they studied these
channels, the potassium

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.850
and sodium channels, in
the giant squid axon.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.570
Now, most of our
axons are about a--

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.040
most of the axons in our brain
are about a micron across.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.040
This axon is about
a millimeter across.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.300
Action potentials propagate
much faster in large axons,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.820
and this axon is involved
in transmitting an action

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.100
potential from the
brain to the tail that

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.080
drives an escape reflex.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.630
The squid squirts water out
of sort of a chamber that

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.710
has water in it.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.080
If the squid senses
danger, it contracts

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.140
muscles that squeeze water out
of that, and it makes a jet.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.050
And it squirts the squid
forward away from danger.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.860
So that action potential has
to propagate very quickly

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.290
from the brain to the
tail, and it does that

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.880
through this enormous axon.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.580
That axon is so big you can
now put multiple wires inside

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.080
of it.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.400
You don't even need to pull
these glass electrodes.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.730
You can just take little
wires and stick them in--

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.230
chop out a little
piece of the axon

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.200
and stick wires inside
of it and study it.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.850
Yes?

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.464
AUDIENCE: So if the
body of this squid

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.874
is like a giant [INAUDIBLE]
it has arms coming out

00:12:13.874 --> 00:12:14.782
of its head?

00:12:14.782 --> 00:12:15.490
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.240
You eat that part,
and you eat that part.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.290
Not that.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.580
You throw away the
most interesting part.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.417
OK, any other questions?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.530
All right, so now
we're setting out

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.580
to measure these sodium and
potassium conductances, OK?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.090
So how do we do that?

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.560
So what we really
want to do is to set--

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.570
we want to measure
conductance, which

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.670
is the relation between
voltage and current.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.580
So we'd like to do
is to be able to set

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.660
the voltage at a certain level
and measure the current that

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.150
flows through these channels.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.690
So you really want to
plot the IV curve, right?

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.240
You want to set the voltage,
measure the current,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.400
and do that at a bunch
of different voltages.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.250
And you recall that the
conductance is basically

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:18.580
just the slope of that
curve, right, that line.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.580
So the job is set
voltage, measure current,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740
extract conductance.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.590
Now, the problem with
that is that as soon

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.220
as you set the
voltage of the axon

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.650
somewhere up here in
an interesting range,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.020
the thing begins to spike.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.390
And then the voltage is
no longer constant, right?

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.360
So it becomes really
hard to make measurements

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.737
like this if you depolarize
the cell a little bit

00:13:46.737 --> 00:13:48.820
to set try to set the
voltage and all of a sudden,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.737
it's [MIMICS BUZZING].

00:13:49.737 --> 00:13:52.180
It's generating spikes.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.510
So what do you do?

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.670
So the trick is to develop a
device called a voltage clamp.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.160
This thing basically
holds the-- so,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.190
look, if the action potential
were really, really slow,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.880
then you could actually
set the voltage.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.330
You could change the current
being injected into the cell

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.110
by hand.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.735
You say, OK, I'm trying to
set the voltage at zero.

00:14:13.735 --> 00:14:15.110
Oh, it got a little
bit too high,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.450
so I turn the current down.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.280
Now the voltage
has gone too low,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.080
so now I turn the current up.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.590
You could do it by hand
if the action potential

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.160
were super slow, if it took
a minute to generate, right?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.500
But the action potential
takes a millisecond.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.720
So that's just too
fast for you to follow.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.150
So you just make a
little electrical circuit

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.550
that does that job for you.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.760
It uses feedback to set
the voltage where you want.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.840
So you put a--

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.010
here's your cell.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.370
Here's your membrane
resistance or conductance

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.600
that you're trying to measure.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.190
You put a electrode in the cell.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.050
You put it into a
little amplifier called

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.470
an operational amplifier.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.660
And then on the other
side of that amplifier,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.050
that differential
amplifier, you put

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.510
the command voltage that
you're trying to set.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.030
So here's the way it works.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.590
Basically, this thing tries
to set the membrane potential.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.690
It tries to make this
value, this voltage,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.920
equal to that voltage.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.640
And it does that by feeding
current back into the cell.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.770
Does that make sense?

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.420
OK, so you use an
operational amplifier.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.270
An op amp has two inputs--

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.230
a plus input, a minus input.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.370
The output is just a gain
times the plus input minus--

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.680
the positive input minus
the negative input.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.070
And the gain is really big.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.380
It's about a million.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.690
So if this input is a
little bit above that input,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.610
this output is big and positive.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.510
If this input is
less than that input,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.900
you can see this is negative.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.230
And so the output
is big and negative.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.970
Any questions?

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.250
So don't get confused here.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:58.570
That G is gain, not conductance,
just for the next few slides.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.810
So how does this work?

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.450
You can see that if the
membrane potential is

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.440
less than the command
voltage, then the output

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.320
voltage is positive and big.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.540
That drives current
into the cell, which

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.090
increases the membrane
potential and makes it

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.980
approach the command voltage.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.640
If the membrane potential
is larger than the command

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.980
voltage, then this thing--

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.250
this is bigger than this.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.920
So this is negative.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.590
And that pulls current
out of the neuron

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.720
and decreases the
membrane potential.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.390
And in both cases,
the membrane potential

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.090
is being pulled toward
the command voltage.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.850
And you can show, if you
just plug in these variables

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.310
into a couple of
equations, that as long

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.550
as the gain is big enough,
the membrane potential

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.720
is forced to be very close
to the command voltage.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.150
All right, so that's
the voltage clamp.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.020
It drives whatever current
is necessary to clamp

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.990
the voltage of the cell
at the command voltage.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.630
And then what we do is
during an experiment,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.750
we step the command
voltage around.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.430
The cell tries to spike.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.569
Those currents turn on.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.119
The cell tries to
spike, but this thing

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.390
keeps the voltage locked
at whatever it is that you

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.849
want the voltage to be.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.763
And then you measure the
amount of current required.

00:17:20.763 --> 00:17:22.680
You just measure the
amount of current flowing

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.339
through this
resistor here that's

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.120
required to hold the
cell at any voltage.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.350
All right, any questions?

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.150
Voltage clamp-- very cool.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.660
Yes?

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.390
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain gain again?

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.110
MICHALE FEE: Gain is
just the multiplier

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.890
here in this equation.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.110
So if there's a tiny difference
between the two inputs,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.970
the output is bigger.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.490
That's what gain means, right?

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.220
If the gain is a million, if
there's a microvolt difference

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.220
between the two inputs, the
output will be about a volt.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.030
And it would be a plus or minus,
depending on which of those two

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.870
was more positive.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.650
OK, so now let's get to the
actual voltage clamp experiment

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.990
that Hodgkin and Huxley did.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.970
Here, we have two
wires in our cell-- one

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.580
to measure voltage and the
other one to inject current.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.240
That's exactly what they did.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.500
There's one wire here.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.750
That's a little piece of axon.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.050
You can literally cut the
squid open, find that axon.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.740
It's a big, white-looking tube
about a millimeter across.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.480
Cut two pieces of it, take two
wires, stick one in each end.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.850
I drew it like this, but
if you did it that way,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.840
they'd probably short together.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.140
So then one of those
measures the voltage.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.750
You set a command,
and the other wire

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.180
allows you to inject
current inside the axon.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.230
And then you seal the ends
with a little bit of Vaseline.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.730
Yes?

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.550
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what
is the command VC?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.410
MICHALE FEE: VC is
the command voltage

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.640
that you're trying to set
the inside of the cell to.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.310
Remember, here,
we're setting the--

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:10.040
VC is what you're controlling
as the experimenter.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.755
You're setting the
voltage with that command.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.360
So the voltage clamp
then holds the inside

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.800
of the cell at that
command voltage,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.460
and then you're measuring
the current with this device.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.370
There's a readout that tells
you how much current it's

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.100
putting into the cell, or it
goes onto an oscilloscope,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.747
because it's time dependent.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.780
So let's do an experiment.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.610
Here's an example
of an experiment.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.220
They hold the
command at minus 65.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.300
And suddenly, they drop the
command voltage to minus 130.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.460
What does the cell do?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.310
What is the current?

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.810
Nothing.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.300
There's a little transient here,
which is the amount of current.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.640
It took to charge that capacitor
up to minus 130 millivolts,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.900
and then nothing happens.

00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:09.180
All right, let's do
another experiment.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.660
Now we're going to start
our cell at minus 65

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.070
and suddenly jump the
voltage up to zero.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.900
So we're going to
depolarize our cell.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.625
And now something happens.

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:27.450
We get a big pulse of
current that's negative.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.340
What does negative mean?

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.110
Anybody remember
what negative current

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.260
means by our definition?

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.340
Negative means that there
are positive ions going

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.090
into this cell.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.770
So it's charging the cell up.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.890
This is membrane current now.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.020
So you just have to
remember that definition.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.560
Negative membrane current
means that positive charges

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.990
are going into the cell, and
that's depolarizing the cell.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.270
And then that negative current
lasts for a few milliseconds,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.500
and then the current reverses
sign and becomes positive

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.450
and stays on.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.790
So what is that?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.510
So the first thing that
Hodgkin and Huxley did was they

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:20.840
tried to figure out what causes
that pattern of currents.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.310
So here's what they did.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:29.452
They had this idea that part
of this might be due to sodium.

00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:31.410
And so what they did was
they did an experiment

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:36.270
where they replaced
sodium outside the cell,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.585
outside the axon, with an ion.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.700
They kept the chloride, but
they replaced the sodium

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.420
with choline.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.440
So they used choline chloride,
so it's a salt solution,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.020
but it has no sodium in it.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.740
And then they redid
that experiment.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.865
And here's what they found.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.070
What they found was-- so
here it is-- with sodium,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.570
and if they replace
the sodium, they

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.250
find that they get
almost the same thing,

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.510
except that initial
negative pulse goes away.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.230
And so they hypothesized that
that part is due to sodium.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.390
And so now you just
subtract this from this

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.110
to get the difference.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.245
And that is the sodium current.

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:28.120
Does that make sense?

00:22:30.648 --> 00:22:31.690
And then one other thing.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.190
Through another
set of experiments,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.200
they were able to show
that this part that's

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.380
left after you block
or remove sodium

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.900
is actually due to potassium.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.540
So this is the
potassium current.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.320
That is a sodium current.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.020
So by doing different
kinds of experiments--

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.148
so one of the things that you're
able to do that they didn't do

00:22:52.148 --> 00:22:54.190
initially, but later, they
were able to do things

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.470
like take that
little piece of axon,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.570
take out a little miniature
paint roller, squish the axon,

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.080
roll the roller over the axon,
squish its guts out, and then

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.410
fill it up again with solutions
that they control that have

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.800
different ions in them.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.010
And so they're able to study--

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.580
just do multiple different
kinds of experiments

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.910
to be sure that this
slow thing that turns on,

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.550
this slow positive
current is potassium,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.102
and this fast negative
current is sodium.

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:26.074
All right?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.820
So now what you
can do is you can

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:36.250
do this experiment at
different voltages here, right?

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.000
We want to measure how
these currents depend

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.220
on voltage, right?

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.810
We can see here how
they depend on time.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.380
We can also see how
they depend on voltage,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.440
by doing this experiment
at different voltages.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.570
You start at some
negative potential.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.930
You step the voltage up to minus
40, or you step it up to zero,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.580
or you step it up to 40.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.670
And now you can measure
that potassium current

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.190
as a function of
time, or the sodium

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.300
current as a function of time.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.032
All right?

00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:09.190
At different voltages.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.530
All right, so those look kind
of weird, especially that one.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.250
That looks kind of
scary, like what

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.910
the heck is going on there?

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.880
But it turns out that
both of these things

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.310
are actually pretty simple.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.060
Once we dig a little bit more
into how these currents are

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.690
produced, you're going to see
that there's a very simple way

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.060
to understand what's
happening there.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.388
All right, any questions?

00:24:40.388 --> 00:24:40.930
Bear with me.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.630
So now what we want
to do is we want

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.420
to measure the voltage
dependence of these things

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.680
kind of separately from
the time dependence.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.560
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.490
going to measure the peak
potassium current, kind

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.470
of this steady state
potassium current

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.900
as a function of voltage.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.840
So here's our IV
curve that I promised

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.030
that we were going to plot.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.590
Peak current as a
function of voltage.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.830
You can see that it's
approximately linear

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:19.540
above minus 50 or so millivolts.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.440
The sodium current
looks kind of weird.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.730
We're going to plot
the peak sodium current

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.940
as a function of voltage.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.330
And we see that the peak sodium
current has this weird shape.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.730
It's sort of linear up
here at positive voltages,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.600
and then it crashes down to
zero at negative voltages.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.970
All right?

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.015
Still kind of weird and scary.

00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:49.390
So let's see if
we can understand

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.330
where this comes from.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.680
I just replotted them here.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.160
So now, remember that we
use this voltage clamp

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.470
to measure current as
a [AUDIO OUT] voltage.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.010
But what is it that we're
really trying to understand?

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.590
We're really trying to
understand the conductances,

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.690
those resistors, right?

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.690
We're under trying to understand
the voltage and time dependence

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.830
of those conductances.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.720
So we're trying to
extract conductance

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.580
as a function of voltage.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.920
And remember that [AUDIO OUT]
is just conductance

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.580
times a driving
potential for potassium.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.490
Sodium current is just sodium
conductance times the sodium

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.860
driving potential.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.530
So we you could imagine
extracting the conductance

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.740
as current divided by
the driving potential.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.580
This is what we're
really trying to find.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.630
Rather than doing this
division, because this one

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.780
over-- this thing goes
to zero at the places

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.633
where the voltage is equal
to the equilibrium potential.

00:26:55.633 --> 00:26:56.800
So we don't want to do that.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.650
We're going to solve
this problem graphically.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:05.230
So here's the driving
potential, right, V minus Ek.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.790
It goes to zero at Ek, right?

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.370
And we want to find
a conductance that

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.620
makes this look like this.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.910
So if this is kind
of a straight line,

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.100
if the current as a
function of voltage

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.890
is kind of a straight line
and this is a straight line,

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.210
what does that tell us about
the conductance in this region

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.750
up here?

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.100
It's constant.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.540
Excellent.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.920
Now, if the driving potential
is very negative here

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.460
but the current is zero,
then what's the conductance?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.980
Driving potential
is big and negative.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.420
Current is zero.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.940
What does that tell us
about the conductance?

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.820
It's zero.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.090
OK, so not so hard, right?

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.700
We have [AUDIO OUT] zero
here and constant here.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.340
So can anyone just show me
what that might look like?

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.520
Good.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.920
It could be like a jump.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.960
It could be kind of smooth.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.940
And that's exactly
what it looks like.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.730
So the conductance is zero
here, which it has to be,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.430
because the current is zero,
even though the the potential

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.690
is negative.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.820
And the conductance
here is constant,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.550
because the driving
potential is constant here.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.230
The driving potential is linear,
and the current is linear,

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:34.430
so this needs to be
constant, all right?

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.220
So the conductance
is very simple.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.010
It turns off at
negative voltages

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:44.040
and turns on and then stays
on at higher voltages.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.420
Let's do that for sodium.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.700
This thing looks
crazy, weird, right?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.230
But let's go through
the same operation.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.260
Here's our driving
potential for sodium.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.390
Remember, it's got a
reversal at plus 55.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.280
But it's a straight line, right?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.380
That's a battery and a resistor.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.240
So there's our
driving potential.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.710
Now, this is linear.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.550
This is linear.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.740
So what does the conductance
look like up here?

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.780
Good.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.110
This is zero, but this
is big and negative, so

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.170
what does the conductance
look like down here?

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.070
Good .

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.620
Starting to look
pretty familiar, right?

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.420
Boom.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.600
It's exactly the same.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:34.270
Both of these conductances are
off at negative potentials,

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.155
and they turn on at positive
voltages and remain constant.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.542
Yes?

00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:47.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:50.548 --> 00:29:51.340
MICHALE FEE: Great.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.030
Great question.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.370
Because the sodium
conductance turns on,

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.080
and then it shuts
off right away.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240
And the shutting off is
a different mechanism.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.720
So we're trying to figure out
how to ignore that and just

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.020
understand the voltage
depends of how it turns on.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.910
Does that make sense?

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.190
And we'll get into
that next Tuesday.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.880
But I'm showing both of
these at the same time

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.000
because they look
similar at the level

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.350
of the voltage dependence.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:24.056
In fact, the way they
turn on is very similar.

00:30:24.056 --> 00:30:27.090
It's just that the sodium has
some other weird thing that

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.680
shuts it off after
a few milliseconds,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.210
and we'll talk about
that next time.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:30.983
Yes?

00:30:30.983 --> 00:30:34.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:34.527 --> 00:30:35.610
MICHALE FEE: No, it's not.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.040
But any non-linearity
here, we're

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.030
going to account for by
changes by voltage dependence

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.410
of the conductance.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.610
So great point.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:50.190
It's a subtlety that
we have kind of imposed

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.550
by this way of writing
down the voltage dependents

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.720
of the current.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.173
Any other questions?

00:30:59.173 --> 00:31:01.340
No?

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.680
OK, pushing on.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:13.850
So this kind of gradual
turning on, this sort of zero

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.370
conductance down here
and a [INAUDIBLE] up

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.970
here, that's called a
sigmoidal voltage dependence.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.760
And it's the voltage
dependence of activation.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.160
It's how these channels turn on.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.710
And as I said
before, we're going

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:32.060
to deal with the other
properties of the sodium

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.960
channel that turn it off later.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.060
So both have a sigmoidal voltage
dependence of activation.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.070
And if you plot this,
you can see that--

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.420
if you plot this on
a log scale here--

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.230
log scale on conductance,
linear here on potential.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.140
You can see that
both of these curves,

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.910
both the potassium
and the sodium,

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.680
have this very characteristic
exponential turn-on followed

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:11.165
by his saturation and constant
conductance at higher voltages.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.720
All right, any questions?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.270
That's voltage dependence.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.430
Now we're going to turn
to time dependence.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.500
So you can see that
the time dependence--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.220
so this driving potential,
that's just constant.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.590
That just depends on the voltage
and the reversal potential.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.270
And so we can separate out--

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.670
this thing is just
any time dependence

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.610
this has is dependent on the
time dependence of the voltage.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.920
But in our voltage
clamp experiments,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.420
the voltage is constant.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.070
So this thing is constant.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.630
So any time
dependence [AUDIO OUT]

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.780
current has to be due to time
dependence of the conductance,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.353
right?

00:32:54.353 --> 00:32:55.770
And what that means
is we can just

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.090
look at the shape of this
potassium current-- remember,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.220
this is the potassium
current here.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.070
That time dependence is
just due to time dependence

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.840
of the conductance.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.120
Does that make sense?

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.830
So what's happening is
the potassium conductance

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.360
is starting at zero.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.610
The moment you step
the voltage up,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.520
that thing begins to
grow gradually and then

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.170
runs up to a constant
potassium conductance in time.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.110
It starts off, ramps
up, and then becomes

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.790
constant, all right?

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.570
So that's the time dependence.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.790
Sort of gracefully turns on.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:40.600
That process of turning
on is called activation.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.500
The sodium conductance--
or current, the same thing.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.917
The sodium current is just
the sodium conductance.

00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:48.750
The sodium current is
a function [AUDIO OUT]

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.410
is the sodium conductance
as a function of time,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.260
times a constant.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.540
In our voltage clamp
experiment, again, this voltage

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.680
is constant.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.450
So the sodium
conductance turns on.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.530
That's activation.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:06.180
But then it turns off, and
that's called inactivation.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.570
So the sodium current
has [AUDIO OUT]

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.800
sodium conductance
has two things going

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.110
on-- one, activation, and
the second is inactivation.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.159
And it turns out these are
two separate biophysical

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.710
mechanisms.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:27.300
And we're going to spend
more time on this next week.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.280
So, notice something
interesting.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.620
The sodium conductance turns on.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.850
You depolarize the cell.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.600
Sodium conductance turns on
right away and then shuts off.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.730
The potassium conductance has
a delay, and then it turns on.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.670
Does that look familiar?

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:51.580
It looks an awful
lot like this, right?

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.130
Here's the sodium conductance.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.300
Turns on and then shuts off.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.770
And then the
potassium conductance

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.930
turns on with a delay.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.070
And that gives us
an action potential.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.790
So you can see that when
you use voltage clamp

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.240
and dissected out the time
difference of the sodium

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.610
and potassium
conductance, it looks just

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.270
like the thing we
concocted earlier, just

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.760
sort of our toy example for how
to make an action potential.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.770
Pretty cool, right?

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.850
OK, it's starting to come
together piece by piece.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.460
So we're now going to
dig in a little bit

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.270
deeper into the biophysics
of how you get these voltage

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.500
and time dependencies.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.700
So we're going to
derive the equation

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.990
for the voltage dependence.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.970
Anybody want to
take a crazy guess

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.110
on how we're going to do that?

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.970
Just a wild guess, how you might
derive the voltage dependence

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.770
of something?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.330
No?

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:01.720
OK.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.470
We're going to use the
Boltzmann equation.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.280
And we're going to derive
different equations that

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.970
describe the way those
channels turn on,

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.530
how those conductances turn on.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.643
All right?

00:36:17.643 --> 00:36:19.310
And once we do that,
we're going to have

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.160
a simple set of equations--

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.330
and not just equations.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.510
We're going to have
a set of processes

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.060
that we can think of
as happening a loop,

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.260
in a for loop.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.460
That's our algorithm
for an action potential.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.680
All right, so let's dive
into single channels

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.730
and see how they work.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.470
So, of course, currents
result from ionic flow

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.320
through ion channels.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.410
It's actually possible
to record currents

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.930
from single ion channels.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.980
We can actually make a
version of our voltage clamp

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.540
that we can attach to
a single ion channel.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.190
And the way you do that is--

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.980
so when you take this piece
of glass and you pull it,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.350
instead of poking
it through the cell,

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.420
instead of making
it really sharp

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.400
and poking it through
the cell, what you do

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.940
is you make it a
little bit blunter,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.350
so it's got kind of a rough end.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.970
And then you can
fire a polish-- you

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.940
can hold the end of that
electrode into a flame.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.440
Not quite.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.875
It's usually a filament
that heats up hot.

00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:27.250
You hold the end
of the electrode

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.220
near this hot filament
and it melts the tip

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.290
into a nice, round--

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.630
it's still a tube, but
the edges of the tube

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.155
are nice and smooth.

00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:39.280
And now when you take that
tube and you press it up

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.740
against the cell--

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.770
actually, you attach
a little plastic tube

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.362
to the end of the glass, and
you press that that electrode up

00:37:48.362 --> 00:37:49.070
against the cell.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.210
And you actually literally
suck on it with your mouth

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.950
onto that tube.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.780
And it sucks the membrane
up against that smooth end

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.780
of the electrode.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.520
And it sticks.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.870
The lipids of the membrane
actually seal themselves

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.070
onto the end of the glass.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.070
So now no currents can flow
out through these edges

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.330
here, all right?

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.130
And then you hook it
up to a very sensitive

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.390
current amplifier.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.610
And now you can
control the voltage.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.743
You can actually just
rip that off of the cell,

00:38:20.743 --> 00:38:21.910
so now there's no more cell.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.950
You just have an ion
channel sitting there

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.300
on a piece [AUDIO OUT]
on the end of your glass.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.460
Now you can do a
voltage clamp experiment

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.350
and study the current--

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.870
the voltage dependence
of the current

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.068
through that ion channel.

00:38:37.068 --> 00:38:38.360
So here's what this looks like.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.277
Here's one experiment.

00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:40.810
We're going to
start at minus 100.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.710
This is a potassium channel.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:47.532
You depolarize the potassium
channel up to 50 millivolts,

00:38:47.532 --> 00:38:49.990
and you see that that current,
through that single channel,

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.990
starts flickering on and off.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.370
Here's another trial.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.795
Turns on, turns off,
turns on, turns off.

00:38:57.795 --> 00:38:59.170
You can do that
a bunch of times.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.550
You can see something
interesting.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.010
The current is either off--

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.300
doesn't turn on gradually,
doesn't change smoothly.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.340
It just flickers
between on and off.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.790
That's a very important
aspect of ion channels.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.600
But if you average all
those trials together,

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.010
you see that you get an
average current that looks just

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:28.940
like the current
that Hodgkin-Huxley

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.540
measured in the whole axon.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.560
How is that possible?

00:39:43.075 --> 00:39:44.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.150
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.650
Good.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.600
So, basically,
what we're doing is

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.530
we're measuring one
ion channel many times.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.930
But on a cell, you're
measuring a bunch

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:03.470
of ion channels, each of which
is doing something like this.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.900
But they're happening
all at the same time,

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.140
and the current
is being averaged.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.480
So here, we're averaging
the current one at a time.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.510
And on a whole cell, we're
just averaging a bunch of them

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.770
at once.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.780
It's called
ergodicity in physics.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.250
It's called the
ensemble average.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.920
OK, you can do the
same thing for sodium.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.620
You take your patch,
a new patch electrode.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.650
Fire polish it.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.450
Push it up to a cell.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.860
Apply some suction.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.730
Glues on.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.360
This time, we had
a sodium channel.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.680
And now you can see
that the thing, again,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.830
flickers on, flickers off,
flickers on, flickers off.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.830
But now, they all flicker
on right at the beginning,

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.860
and then they flicker
off and stay off.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.320
And if you average all
those different trials,

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.500
you see an ensemble
average sodium current

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.680
that looks just like when
you measure the sodium

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.520
current on a whole axon, OK?

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.870
But the key thing is that these
channels have two states--

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.790
on and off-- and they
flicker back and forth

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.480
between those two states,
conducting and non-conducting.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.930
So we can now write down--

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.820
we could start
working with this idea

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.460
that our ion channels are
either open or closed.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.620
And we can think
of a probability

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.920
that the channel is being
open, that the channel is open.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.430
And we can have a total
number of channels.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.260
The number of open
channels is just

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.780
the number of channels you
have times the probability

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.560
that any one of them is open.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.910
If g is the inductance
of one open channel,

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.670
then we can write down the
total potassium conductance

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:53.680
as the probability that any
given ion channel is open

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.830
times the number of channels
times the inductance of one

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.365
open channel.

00:41:58.365 --> 00:41:59.240
Does that make sense?

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.200
And now the claim
here [AUDIO OUT]

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.920
all of the interesting
voltage and time dependence

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.740
of these channels happens here.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.040
Obviously, the number of them
isn't changing very rapidly.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.800
The conductance per channel
is constant, per open channel.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.800
So the interesting stuff
is in the probability

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.590
that the channel [AUDIO OUT].

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.190
And if we want to
get the current,

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.030
we're just going to plug this
conductance into here, OK?

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.430
All right, so let's start
with a potassium channel.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.830
Let's dig in a little bit
deeper into what the potassium

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.090
channel looks like.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.820
Potassium channel is formed
by four identical subunits.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:53.230
They're produced
separately by ribosomes.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:57.540
They form a
heteromer, a tetramer.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.360
And that tetramer
has a hole that

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.270
runs down the middle of it,
which is where the ions flow.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.000
Each of these subunits
has a voltage sensor that

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.960
allows it to turn on and off.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.950
In order for the channel to be
on, all four of those subunits

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.670
has to be open.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.840
So each subunit has an open
state and a closed state.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.460
And for the channel to
be open, all four of them

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.870
have to be in the open state.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:34.430
So if n is the probability
that any one subunit is open--

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.415
I meant to make you guys
answer this question

00:43:37.415 --> 00:43:38.540
before I showed the answer.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.810
But is it clear how
if any one subunit has

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.490
a probability of
being open of n,

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:48.170
then the probability that
the whole channel is open

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.310
is n to the four?

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.540
This n is called
a gating variable.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:01.720
I would like you to know that
the probability that a sodium

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.960
potassium channel is
open is n to the four.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.680
That's an important thing
for you to remember.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.970
That assumes that those four
subunits are independent.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.800
And in potassium
channels, that's

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.710
a very good approximation.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:23.780
So we can now write down the
conductance of our potassium

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.830
channel--

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.930
something times n
to the four, where

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:33.090
that something is that
inductance of one ion channel.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.560
So we can now write
down the current as n.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.730
Open conductance times n to the
four times a driving potential.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.670
And that n is called
the gating variable

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.810
for the potassium conductance.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:55.310
All right, any questions?

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.050
No?

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:01.550
Yes?

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.570
MICHALE FEE: n absolutely
does depend on voltage.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:07.390
Very good.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.640
That's where we're going next.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.220
But before we go on
to that, I wanted

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.120
to add one other thing,
which I think is really cool.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.990
We're going to do the voltage
dependence of a potassium

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.970
channel using the
Boltzmann equation.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.490
So here's the way you think
about a potassium channel

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.595
working.

00:45:37.595 --> 00:45:38.720
Here's a potassium channel.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.940
We're showing a cross-section.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.460
Here it is.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.550
Here's the membrane,
the lipid bilayer.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.370
Here's our potassium channel,
sitting in the membrane.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.920
And we're taking a cross-section
through that tetramer

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.180
that shows two subunits.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.280
And I'm showing
the voltage sent--

00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.320
I'm showing the mechanism
that that opens and closes

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.180
one of those subunits.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.530
This subunit we'll also have a
voltage sensor and a gate that

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.000
looks the same.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.980
So look, the voltage sensor--
how do you sense voltage?

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.710
You sense voltage
with charge, right?

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:20.150
Voltage differences, I should
say, you sense with a charge.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.540
Because voltage gradients
are electric fields,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.310
and electric fields
push on charges.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:30.050
So if we want to detect
the voltage difference

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.720
across this membrane, we put
a charge in the membrane.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.910
When the voltage
difference is zero,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.560
there's little force
on those charges.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.200
Now, if we suddenly
hyperpolarize the [AUDIO OUT]

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.530
cell so it's very
negative, now there's

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:50.980
an electric field
inside the membrane that

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.230
points toward the inside
of the cell, which

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:57.290
pushes those charges toward
the inside of the cell.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.920
And now you can just have a
little mechanical linkage.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.110
That's not really
what it looks like,

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:07.390
but there's some way that the
amino acids and the protein

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.510
are configured so that when
those charges get pushed on,

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.030
it closes a gate.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.800
And now the current
can no longer

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.450
flow through the ion channel.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.460
OK, so now we're going
to derive how this--

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.940
we're going to see how to
derive this voltage dependence

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.100
from the Boltzmann equation.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.720
All right, so, everybody,
this is just for fun.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.480
I don't expect you to
know how to do this.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.620
I just want you to see
it, because I personally

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.210
get chills when I see this.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.660
It's really cool.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.950
But I'm not expecting you to
be able to reproduce it, OK?

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:56.390
So just watch.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:58.170
So, again, the
Boltzmann equation

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:01.500
says that the
probability of being

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.440
in two states, open or
closed, depends on the energy

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.000
difference between them.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.650
So we have an open state
and a closed state.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.530
And when the voltage
inside the cell

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:17.840
is zero-- when the voltage
difference between the inside

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.700
and the outside of the
cell is zero, [AUDIO OUT]

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.300
know that the sodium
channel likes to be open.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:29.570
So what that means is that the
open state has a lower energy

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.970
than the closed state, right?

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.970
Sodium channel likes to open
when the cell is depolarized.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.770
That means the voltage
inside and outside

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:40.670
are close to each other, right?

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.120
Open state has a lower
energy than the closed state.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.940
Let's call that energy
difference delta u.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.630
And it's close to kt,
because when it's open,

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.270
the channel kind of flickers
back and forth between open

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.380
and closed.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.160
Does that make sense?

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.180
Now let's put on--

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.260
let's hyperpolarize
the inside of our cell.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.090
So now the voltage
inside is low.

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.760
There's a voltage
gradient, an electric field

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.980
that is trying to
push those charges in.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.650
Now, you can see that
those charges here

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:19.290
are sitting at a lower voltage.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.500
So in the closed
state, those charges

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.660
are down here at
a lower potential.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.520
What does that mean for the
energy of the closed state

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.640
when the cell is hyperpolarized?

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.050
Its lower.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.240
The energy of the
closed state is low

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.270
because those charges are
toward the inside of the cell,

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.640
and the voltage is low.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.590
Now, what happens if the
cell is hyperpolarized,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.390
but it happens to be
in the open state?

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.760
You can see those charges
are closer this way.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.800
So you can see that the
energy of-- these charges

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.500
are still sitting in a voltage
that's lower than outside.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.370
So that open state has
a slightly lower energy.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.560
But you can see that
the closed state still

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.620
has a much lower energy
than the open state, OK?

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.780
And we can write down
that voltage difference

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:17.840
as a gating charge times
this voltage difference.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.460
So now let's just take--

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.220
here is an open state.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.850
It has an energy difference
of a little amount, w.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.180
Open state is lower than
closed by an amount w.

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:38.850
When the voltage
inside the cell is low,

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.300
we've decreased the
energy of the closed state

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.620
by this amount-- gating charge
times membrane potential.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.760
And now we have an energy
difference in the open state

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.770
and the closed, the
energy difference

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.510
between the open
state and closed state

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.130
as a function of voltage.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:00.490
We have a simple equation that
describes the energy difference

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.860
between the open and
closed state as a function

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.660
of the membrane potential.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:09.190
And now we can just plug that
into the Boltzmann equation

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:14.560
and derive the probability
of being open and closed.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.650
So we just plug that
delta u into here,

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:21.380
w minus gating
charge times voltage.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.150
Now let's calculate the
probability of being open.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.990
This gives us the ratio
of open to closed.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.370
How do we calculate the
probability of being open?

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.020
Well, n is the
probability of being open.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.560
That's just probability
of being open divided

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.790
by open plus closed.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.400
What's the probability
of being open

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.110
plus the probability
of being closed?

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.980
Well, if it's in one or the
other, then the sum of those

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.650
has to be one, OK?

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.650
And now divide both
top and bottom by p0.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:52:00.120
The probability of being open
it's just 1 over 1 plus p

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.600
closed over p open, which
is just the inverse of this.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.670
And that's equal to that.

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:11.430
All right, that may have gone
by a little bit too fast.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.740
And I wasn't very
smooth on that.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.770
But you can see the idea, right?

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.430
It's estimating how
the energy difference

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:24.870
between the open
and closed state

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.210
depends on the
voltage of the cell,

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.250
and it's just an
energy difference.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:33.770
So it has to be a charge
times a voltage, yeah?

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.750
And that's right [AUDIO OUT]
charge times a voltage.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.060
And now we're just doing
a little bit of algebra

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.890
to extract the
probability of open

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.990
from open divided by closed.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:50.730
And now if we just plug that
into there, we get this.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.230
All right?

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.900
So now let's see how that
compares to the actual answer.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:01.200
Probability of open is just 1
over 1 plus this exponential.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.880
Here's what that
data looked like.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.570
Remember, that was the
data for the conductance

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:07.635
as a function of voltage.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:16.160
Here's a fit to a functional
form that looks like that.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.774
And here is the
prediction from Boltzmann.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.000
You can see that it
almost exactly fits.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.650
And you can actually
extract, biophysically,

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:33.490
what the gating charge is
inside this tiny, little protein

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:37.060
simply by fitting
this to the data.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:41.260
Pretty cool, right?

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:41.760
Yes?

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.495
AUDIENCE: What is w?

00:53:44.495 --> 00:53:46.120
MICHALE FEE: It's
the energy difference

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.820
between the open and closed
state when the voltage is zero.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.630
So you kind of have
to fit that, too.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:59.590
If the voltage is zero,
it's the energy difference

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:04.120
between the open and closed
state when the voltage is zero.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.500
And then you subtract from
that the energy of the gating

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.240
charge as a function of
voltage inside the cell, OK?

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.040
Yes

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.030
AUDIENCE: So is that
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.590
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
each has the sensor,

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:28.820
and they all have to be open
for the ion channel to be open.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:29.653
Yes?

00:54:29.653 --> 00:54:32.840
AUDIENCE: Do you not need to
put it to the power of four?

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.840
MICHALE FEE: No, because
this is the probability

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.310
that one subunit is open.

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.350
But that's a good point.

00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.950
If you want to
compare that to the--

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:41.940
so you're right.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.920
If you want to compare
that to the conductance

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.600
of the whole
channel, then it has

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.050
to be raised to
the power of four.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.270
And that's been
accounted for here.

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.930
Good question.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.860
Any other questions?

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.560
Boltzmann men equation
is pretty cool.

00:55:07.376 --> 00:55:12.800
If you know the mass
of a nitrogen molecule

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.900
and the acceleration
due to gravity,

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.140
what can you calculate with
the Boltzmann equation?

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:18.650
Any idea?

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.800
The mass of a nitrogen
molecule and the acceleration

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.568
due to gravity.

00:55:28.568 --> 00:55:29.860
AUDIENCE: Pressure of nitrogen?

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.180
The partial pressure
of nitrogen?

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.060
MICHALE FEE: Close.

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.990
You can calculate the
height of the atmosphere.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:42.173
You can do all kinds
of really cool stuff

00:55:42.173 --> 00:55:43.340
with the Boltzmann equation.

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.605
OK, there was another
question here.

00:55:51.605 --> 00:55:52.105
No?

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.760
So you can extract,
actually, these quantities--

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:03.440
the gating charge and this
energy difference in the zero

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.190
voltage state.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:10.600
And the fit is very good.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.980
OK, so that's
voltage dependence.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.260
I highlighted
these slides that I

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:27.490
don't expect you to be
able to reproduce in blue,

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:31.180
just to make it more
clear for your review

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.270
what you have to focus on.

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:36.040
OK, let's look at
the time dependence.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.090
The time dependence
is pretty simple.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:40.600
It's going to just involve a
linear first order differential

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.120
equation.

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.930
You guys are all super
experts on that now, right?

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:49.960
So we have an ion channel--

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.540
sorry, a subunit that's
either open or closed, right?

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.850
We have an open
state, closed state.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:59.420
What we're going to do is--

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.510
so the way to think about
this is the ion channel,

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.090
the subunit, if the
cell is polarized,

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.000
is sitting in the
closed state, right?

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.330
When you depolarize the neuron,
that changes the energy levels.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:18.330
[AUDIO OUT] Which way was it?

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:19.610
I forget.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.020
The closed state
has a lower energy.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.040
Now, when you
depolarize the cell,

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.440
the closed state suddenly
has a much higher energy,

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.780
and it's close to
the open state.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.680
And so, at some
point, that subunit

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.670
will jump over to the
open state, right?

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:40.930
But that takes time.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.090
You change the energy
levels, but it takes time

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:47.830
for the system to jump
into the open state.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.520
Why is that?

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:57.330
Because that transition is
caused by thermal fluctuations.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:59.540
And so you have to wait for
one of those fluctuations

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.030
to kick you over
into the open state.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:06.660
So we're going to
model those transitions

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.830
between open and closed states
with a simple rate equation

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.360
that's voltage dependent.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.100
We have an open
state, and we imagine

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:18.230
that n is the probability
of being in the open state.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.340
And we can equivalently
think of it

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:24.120
as if we have a
population of subunits.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:28.080
And let's think of it
more as the fraction.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.970
It's also equivalent to--

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:33.160
just whichever way you
want to think about it,

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.400
either works well.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.960
But you can also think
of it as the probability

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.290
of being in the open
state, or the number

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:44.980
of subunits that are in the
open state in a population.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.360
You also have a closed state.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.920
So if n is the
probability of being

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.980
in the open state,
[AUDIO OUT] of a closed state

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:56.923
with probability
1 minus n, right?

00:58:56.923 --> 00:58:58.340
If you're in the
closed state, you

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.750
have some transition rate,
probability per unit time,

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:05.570
of going from the closed
state to the open state.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.070
And if you're in
the open state, you

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:10.380
have some probability
per unit time beta

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.900
of going into the closed state.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.340
So those things have
units of per second,

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.840
probability per second.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.880
Yes?

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.770
Rebecca, right?

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:23.467
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:23.467 --> 00:59:25.255
What's the cause for
the fluctuations?

00:59:25.255 --> 00:59:26.600
Just regular [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.010
MICHALE FEE: Just warmth.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:40.190
And these things are
voltage dependent, remember?

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:43.220
Those depend on the
energy difference

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.390
between that open
and closed state.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.700
All right, let's develop our
first order linear equation.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.710
It's going be very simple.

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.370
We have a closed
state, an open state.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.010
The change in the
number of open states

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:04.400
is just going to be the number
of closed states, the number

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.060
of closed subunits that
open, minus the number

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.610
of open subunits that close.

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.740
That makes sense?

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.300
All right, that's simple enough.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.230
The change in the number
open subunits per unit time

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:24.800
is going to be the
number of closed subunits

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.260
that there are times
the probability

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.540
that a closed subunit
opens per unit time--

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.960
that's alpha-- minus--

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.120
remember, the number
of closed subunits

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.120
that open is the number
of closed subunits

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.460
times the probability
per unit time

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.310
that a closed subunit
opens, all right?

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:46.245
And the number of open
subunits that close

01:00:46.245 --> 01:00:50.340
is just the number of open
subunits times the probability

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.245
that any one of them
closes per unit time.

01:00:53.245 --> 01:00:54.120
Does that make sense?

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:01.040
A lot of words, but the equation
ends up being very simple.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.920
The change per unit
time of n is just

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.470
the number of close
subunits, one [AUDIO OUT],,

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.950
times the probability that
those open per unit time

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:18.270
alpha minus beta times n.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:21.420
Alpha times 1 minus
n minus beta times n.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.520
Any questions about that?

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.040
Alpha, beta are
voltage dependent.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.150
So I've rewritten that equation.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:41.480
n is the probability
that a subunit is open.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.790
Let's just rewrite this.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.690
Let's expand this.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:51.160
Alpha minus alpha times
n minus beta times n.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.700
Factor out the n.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:02:00.720
So you have dn dt equals alpha
minus alpha plus beta times n.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.060
Divide both sides by 1
over alpha plus beta.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.460
What's the steady state
of this-- the steady state

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.780
solution of this equation?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.230
That is the steady
state solution, right?

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:24.000
If you set dn dt equal to
zero, then n is equal to that.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.885
[AUDIO OUT] just n infinity.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.640
And what's that?

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.070
Alpha and beta have
units of per unit time.

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:37.270
So what is one-- what units do
1 over alpha plus beta have?

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.340
Time.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.583
So what might that be?

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:45.940
AUDIENCE: Tau.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.730
MICHALE FEE: Tau.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:47.660
It's a time constant.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.430
So, after all of this,
what we end up with

01:02:53.430 --> 01:03:01.230
is an equation that looks
exactly like what we had for--

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:04.440
we have a first order linear
differential equation exactly

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.990
the same form as
the equation we used

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:10.260
to understand the way
the voltage changes

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.620
in a cell in response
to current injection.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.220
So if we change n infinity,
what is this thing going to do?

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.410
What is n going to do?

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:26.950
It's going to relax [AUDIO OUT]
n infinity with a time

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.310
constant tau.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.500
In all of these
things, the tau is

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.810
tau sub n, because it's
for the n gating variable.

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:37.670
So that's why this
has an n here.

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:46.380
So n infinity and tau
are voltage dependent,

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.740
because they come from
alpha and beta, which

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.218
are voltage dependent.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:58.800
But we actually just derived the
steady state voltage dependence

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.178
of the potassium
conductance, right,

01:04:02.178 --> 01:04:03.345
from the Boltzmann equation?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.636
What is n infinity for
very negative voltages?

01:04:13.636 --> 01:04:17.390
Do you remember it,
just approximately?

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:19.346
Big, small, [AUDIO OUT]?

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.320
What is the steady state?

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.060
What's the probability that
a potassium channel is open,

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.340
that a subunit is open,
at very negative voltages?

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.780
Do you remember?

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.380
Zero.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.410
It's off.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:37.250
For big voltage, n
infinity has to be--

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:42.210
if we think of it as a
probability, it's close to one.

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:46.550
So n infinity goes from
zero at negative voltages,

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:52.280
sigmoidal activation up
to one at high voltages.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:58.550
OK, so now let's look at how n
changes as a function of time.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:01.030
So here's our
[AUDIO OUT] potential.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.980
We're going do a voltage
clamp experiment.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:07.790
We're going to start at minus 80
millivolts and step up to zero.

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:11.380
So what is n
infinity going to do?

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.310
n infinity is just a
function of voltage, right?

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.200
It's like those energy levels.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.510
They change immediately.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.250
So what is n
infinity going to do?

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:25.230
Good.

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:30.690
It's going to start at close
to zero, jump up to one,

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:35.010
and then jump back to
close to zero immediately

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.890
following the voltage.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.400
But what is n going to do?

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.152
Now let's plot n.

01:05:41.152 --> 01:05:43.560
n is going to start at zero.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.200
When you step the voltage
up, n infinity will jump up,

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:55.030
and n will relax exponentially
to a high n infinity

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:59.350
close to one, right?

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:02.010
And then when we
turn back, n infinity

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:07.620
jumps back down to zero, and
n relaxes exponentially back.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.454
Yes?

01:06:08.454 --> 01:06:10.350
AUDIENCE: On the n
[INAUDIBLE],, that's not

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:12.246
relaxing [INAUDIBLE] to one.

01:06:12.246 --> 01:06:14.150
It's to n infinity,
right, at the top?

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:17.510
MICHALE FEE: Yes, but for
a voltage around zero,

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:19.668
n infinity is going
to be close to one .

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.630
Any questions?

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.600
That is called activation.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.660
That's the activation.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.560
Now, this looks a
little funny, right?

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.050
This thing is turning
on immediately.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:43.180
It doesn't have that
nice sigmoidal shape

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.620
that the potassium current had,
or the potassium conductance.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.653
Why is that?

01:06:48.653 --> 01:06:49.820
What are we looking at here?

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.340
We're plotting n.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.310
What is the potassium
conductance or the current?

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.610
How does that relate to n?

01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:59.090
n to the fourth.

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:02.810
So what do we do to plot
the potassium current

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.940
or the potassium conductance?

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.820
We just take this
[AUDIO OUT],, right?

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.500
So what does that look like?

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.960
This process of turning off--

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.840
the gating variable getting
bigger is called activation.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.870
The gating variable getting
smaller, n getting smaller,

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.180
is called disactivation.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.450
So now let's plot
this to the fourth.

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:29.020
So this conductance
turns on gradually,

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.020
but the conductance
is proportional to n

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:31.780
to the fourth.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.470
So let's plot that.

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:34.900
So if we plot n
to the fourth, you

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:40.030
can see that that function
now turns on smoothly in time.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.000
This is time now, right?

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.780
So that gating variable
n relaxes exponentially,

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:52.960
but the conductance goes as the
gating variable to the fourth.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:01.600
And so it has this nice,
graceful turn-on, right?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.700
Because it's the
gating [AUDIO OUT]

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:08.950
exponential to the fourth
looks exactly like this.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:13.740
In fact, that's how Hodgkin
and Huxley figured out

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:19.649
that it's n to the four, because
they knew that if they assume

01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:22.410
that it's an exponentially
decaying gating

01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:25.930
variable, that the only way
they could fit the turn on

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:29.340
of the conductance was by
raising it to the fourth power.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.640
If they raised it to the second
power, it was still too sudden.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.830
If they raised it
to the third power,

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.630
it was still not quite right.

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.819
But if they raised it to
the fifth power, oops,

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:41.816
it's too delayed.

01:08:41.816 --> 01:08:43.399
If they raised it
to the fourth power,

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:51.160
it exactly fits the shape of
the conductance turning on.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.120
And so they inferred--

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.040
they didn't know about subunits.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.910
They just had a piece of
axon, a piece of squid lying

01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:01.850
on a table in front of them.

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.109
And they were able to
figure out that there

01:09:04.109 --> 01:09:07.319
were four independent processes
that turn on the potassium

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:08.040
conductance.

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.250
Pretty cool, right?

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.800
That's what you get by
doing things quantitatively.

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:23.450
So they could
[AUDIO OUT] the shape

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.189
of that potassium
conductance turning

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:27.890
on by this exponential
gating variable raised

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:28.790
to the fourth power.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.420
And from that, they
were able to infer

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:40.700
that it's four independent first
order processes that combine

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:44.260
to produce that activation.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.370
OK, the offset also fits if you
raise it to the fourth power.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:52.580
They were able to measure
the size of the potassium

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.790
conductance to measure
n infinity directly.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:58.340
So we derived it using
the Boltzmann equation,

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.900
but they measured
it directly just

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.770
by the size of the conductance.

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.482
And you can also
measure the time course.

01:10:06.482 --> 01:10:07.940
You don't need to
worry about this.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.880
I'm not expecting--
you should know this.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.563
I'm just showing you
that just for fun.

01:10:12.563 --> 01:10:13.730
You don't need to know that.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.120
And you can extract
these tau's just

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.430
by measuring this exponential
decay at different voltages,

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:33.190
or measuring the inferred
first order process.

01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:36.230
You can infer the time constant
of the first order process

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:41.100
on the onset and the offset
to extract these tau's

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.360
as a function of voltage.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.145
This is tau as a
function of voltage.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.530
From these two quantities,
you can actually

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:56.390
extract alpha and beta.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:01.240
And so you can write down a
simple algebraic expression

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.630
for alpha and beta.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.500
And that's the way they actually
wrote those things down.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.930
They wrote them down as
alpha and beta, rather than n

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.270
infinity and tau.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:14.080
Those are simple expressions
for alpha and beta

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.680
in units of per millisecond
as a function of voltage

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.010
in units of millivolts.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.840
I think-- yeah, it's millivolts.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.830
There it is right there.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:30.090
So you can actually just
take those parameters

01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:34.860
and calculate n
infinity and tau n

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:39.300
and calculate the gating
variable from that using

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.710
that differential equation.

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:43.020
So we have these
nice expressions

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:48.180
for what the steady state,
n infinity, and tau n are.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.225
Now, why did we-- yes?

01:11:54.225 --> 01:11:56.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.170
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
they're per unit time.

01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:02.501
Yeah, so they have units
of per millisecond.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:09.570
OK, so now let's come
back to our picture.

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.320
We have n infinity and tau
n as a function of voltage.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.550
Now we just can plug those
into this differential equation

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:17.450
and solve for n.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.820
Well, we already
know what that does.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.400
n relaxes exponentially
toward n infinity

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.360
with a time constant tau.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.650
But you can integrate
that numerically.

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:32.905
You get the potassium
conductance as n to the four,

01:12:32.905 --> 01:12:34.780
g times n to the four.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.140
You get the potassium
current as g n to the four

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:43.310
times the driving
potential, or V minus Ek.

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:49.000
And now let's come
back to our algorithm

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
for making an action potential.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.870
So we have the parts related
to the potassium current.

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:58.120
We still have to add the
parts related to sodium,

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.230
but it's going to
look very similar.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.370
So here's the idea.

01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:04.420
We start with the membrane
potential at time step t.

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.890
We compute n infinity and tau n.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:12.690
We integrate dn dt one time
step to get the next n.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:18.650
Plug n into our equation to
get the potassium current.

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:24.670
We then add that to
all the other currents

01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.950
to get the total
membrane current.

01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:30.520
We compute V
infinity of the cell.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.830
We integrate dv dt one time
step to get the next voltage.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:39.100
And you plug that in and
calculate the next n infinity,

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.410
all right?

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.690
So we still have to
add the sodium parts,

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:45.850
but you can see we've
gone through all

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:49.390
of these steps
for the potassium.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:53.110
And so we're just
this shy of having

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.930
a full-blown algorithm
for [AUDIO OUT] an action

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:58.120
potential in a neuron.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.550
And not only do you understand
all the little steps,

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:03.190
but you understand the
fundamental biophysics

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:06.250
that leads to that voltage
and time dependence.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.350
All right, so, again, what
I'd like you to be able to do

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:17.790
is to draw that circuit,
the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:21.630
I'd like you to be able to
explain, at a basic level,

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:25.065
what a voltage clamp
is and how it works.

01:14:25.065 --> 01:14:27.690
I'd like you to be able to plot
the voltage and time dependence

01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:29.070
of the potassium current--

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:31.560
remember, this
sigmoidal activation

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.830
of the potassium current--
and the conductance, voltage

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.170
and time dependence.

01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.450
And be able to explain the
time and voltage dependence

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:41.310
of the potassium
conductance in terms

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.890
of the Hodgkin-Huxley
gating variables.

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:45.440
OK?

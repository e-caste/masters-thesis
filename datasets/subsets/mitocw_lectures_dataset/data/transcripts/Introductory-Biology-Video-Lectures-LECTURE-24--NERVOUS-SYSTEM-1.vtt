00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.750
HAZEL SIVE: All right, let's
look at some of your questions.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
A bunch of them
are-- you know what,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.630
I'm probably going to use
that screen most of the time.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.050
Because this one's not fitting.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920
But let's look on this screen.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.200
Your questions really focused
around IPS cells and the kind

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.770
of magic of IPS cells.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.650
And there were a couple of
major questions that came up.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.599
What's the problem with using
IPS cells therapeutically?

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:01.640
Well, there are a number.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.500
One, they're so
new that really we

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.190
don't know what kinds of cell
types these IPS cells can make,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.250
so it's not clear
how to use them.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.470
Another problem actually,
which my colleague,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.560
Professor Jaenisch
works on is the question

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.885
of how to actually
grow these cells.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.990
I have a voice
issue this morning.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.430
So you know, the quieter
you are, the more you'll

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.180
be able to hear my words.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.609
IPS cells, human cells, grow
very slowly in the laboratory.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.150
And it's very
difficult to grow them.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.090
So there are some basic
questions in biology,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.510
as to how to grow these
cells to enough numbers that

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.190
would actually be useful.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.260
But here's another one
that's very important.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.910
The transcription
factors that we

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.450
use to convert adult
cells into IPS cells

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.690
included an oncogene
called c-Myc.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.680
And Myc is the kind of gene
you don't want floating

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.890
around your body nice
and active in your cells,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.840
because it will give you cancer.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.410
So the challenge is
how to actually use

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.900
Myc and other
potent transcription

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.220
factors to turn adult
cells into stem cells

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.640
but not have the stem cells
give the recipient cancer.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.260
And there's some
very clever ways

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.510
that people are trying
to get around this.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.520
It is really impossible
to teach you,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.980
if there are groups
of you talking.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.030
I just cannot do it.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.590
So those of you
talking, please don't.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.370
Thank you.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.940
All right, so what's the
big deal about IPS cells?

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.540
Well, the big deal is
they can be your own.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.720
In theory-- and maybe
in practice, a decade,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.390
five years maybe from now--

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.170
your own cells, your skin cells
could be removed from you,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.270
could be dealt with
in the laboratory,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.180
turned into your own
stem cells, and put back

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.350
into your own body,
and they'd be your own.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.670
So of course, they wouldn't
be rejected by you.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.270
And that is an enormous deal.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.240
They're called autologous cells.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.770
There's an ethical
issue, in that

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.380
you don't have to harvest any
embryos to get stem cell lines.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.240
And that's a big deal.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.690
And here's a conceptual deal.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.310
When we talked
about development,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.430
we talked about this
directional pathway,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.650
where uncommitted
cells became committed

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.660
became differentiated.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.170
It was really thought that
that was a one-way pathway.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.840
But what IPS cell
technology has shown--

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.780
let's look at this--

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.250
all right, we can get the idea
from one of these two screens.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.440
What IPS cell
technology has shown

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.390
is that you can reverse
differentiation.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.940
You can take
differentiated adult cells

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.040
and with the right
regulatory factors,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.340
you can turn them
into stem cells.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.610
And so conceptually,
that's a big deal.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.400
Very good, great questions.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.380
My next office hours
are on Monday, 12-1.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.760
Come along or email me.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.220
But now we're going to
turn to a new module,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.300
and that is the nervous system.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.640
And this is where we
are in the course.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.800
You've done all the
foundational material.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.660
We've talked about formation.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.850
And now we're going
to talk about systems

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.530
and the nervous
system in particular.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.375
Let's start with the
question of what a system is.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.440
Building up, the
complexity of what

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.490
we're talking about in life.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.020
A system refers to many
organs that work together

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.195
with one common function.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.400
Many organs working together
with one overall function.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.400
And you will talk about
two in the course.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.670
You'll talk about the nervous
system and the immune system

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.380
with Professor Jacks.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.200
The nervous system, which is
the topic of the next three

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.320
lectures, has to do
with communication--

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.460
has to do with communication
from the outside to the inside

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.450
of an animal's body, has to
do with communication within

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.360
the body, and has to do
with communication to get

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.920
the organism-- the animal,
because plants don't have

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.120
nervous system--

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.130
the animal to do something.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:06:01.030
So the nervous system
is about communication

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:10.010
to or from or within
the body of an animal.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.110
We've had a number of electrical
analogies in the course.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.510
You will remember the
famous signaling analogy

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.960
of turning on the light
switch over there on the wall.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.330
But now we move on to
another electrical analogy,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.570
which is actually a truer one.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.780
And I'm going to use the
analogy for the nervous system

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.170
of talking about
wires that transmit

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.200
the signal, by which
cells communicates.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.140
I'm going to talk about
connectors between the wires.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.910
And then I'm going to
talk about circuits.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.160
And those are going to be
the topics of the next three

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.860
lectures.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:54.655
So wires, connectors,
and circuits.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.760
And those will be
nervous system 1 to 3,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.960
the lectures in this module.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.015
Today, we're going to
talk about the wires.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.410
And there will be three topics.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.670
The first is the
cell type that's

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.880
got something to do with the
wiring for this communication.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.450
The second is something
called the action potential,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.210
which is the signal
by which cells

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.150
communicate within themselves.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.770
And the third has to do with
the ion channels and pumps.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.110
But let's start by
phrasing the problem

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.730
in a kind of a cool way.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.370
If you look in the human--

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.780
let's look on this screen.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.230
If you look in the human,
and you outline the nerves.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.530
And if you went to see
the living, plasticized

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.480
human exhibits, you would have
seen the plasticized nerves.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.020
They're really extraordinary.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.740
The network of nerves, which
are the unit of communication

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.940
throughout the body.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.320
Is enormous.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:19.090
And it embraces every single
part of the body, almost.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.280
The cell that's involved
in communication--

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.980
we'll draw this out in a
moment-- is the neuron.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.810
And one of the
things about neurons

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.560
is that they've got very
long processes, called axons,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.600
that we will deal
with in depth today.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.549
But let's phrase things
more intuitively.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.309
This is what our
brains look like.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.480
They in fact do not have
nerves innovating them.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.120
And so if you actually
have brain surgery,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.260
you can really be
awake during surgery.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.590
Because there are no nerves
within the brain, or at least

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.630
no pain receptors
within the brain.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.910
Of course, the brain has
nerves, but there are

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.700
no pain receptors in the brain.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.920
Human brain.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.640
Billions and billions
and trillions of neurons.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.920
We'll talk about numbers
in future lectures.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.130
But let's look a little
more deeply in the brain,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.330
so you can see how
packed it is with neurons

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.760
and how the connections
between the neurons

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.820
are so unbelievably
complex that thinking

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.720
about how you use
circuitry to construct

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.070
the human nervous system--

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.350
or indeed that of most animals--

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.720
is an enormous problem.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.480
Professor Sebastian Seung here--

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.520
whose name is off the screen,
and I apologize to him,

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.990
it's the screen snafu, it
will be on your power points

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.370
when you download
these from the web--

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.580
is working on the task
of putting together

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.700
all the connections
in the human brain.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.190
And starting with a
little cube of brain--

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.990
this is about 100 microns,
it's not quite a cube,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.340
but it's approximately
a 100-micron cube--

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.140
he's worked to try to
figure out what all the cell

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.440
connections are and
what all the cells are,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.320
within this little
tiny cube of brain,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.780
which is just a tiny, tiny
fraction of your brain.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.430
So look at this.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.080
This is an electron
micrograph that he's

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.060
put a bunch of
electron micrographs

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.060
together, to build
this 3D structure.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.790
And now his students and
those of Professor Lichtman

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.320
at Harvard go and
outline a particular cell

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.020
in serial sections,
through this cube.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.680
These are very tiny sections.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.700
These are about five
nanometer sections.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.250
And then they put these
sections together.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.170
And you can get the
three dimensional

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.640
structure of the neuron, as
it's going through the cube.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.450
And you can start to map
how this neuron lies next

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.990
to other neurons.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.940
OK, there it's going backwards.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.370
And there are two cells
lying next to one another

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.100
that you can get
in 3D rendering,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.820
with this very painstaking
process of first,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.550
getting sections of
the brain, putting them

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.180
all together into a chunk,
and then deconstructing

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.390
the individual cells
shapes within that chunk.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.310
If you do that for the
whole chunk of tissue,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.230
this is what you get.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.180
There's that red and
that green neuron.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.090
Here is a blue one,
there's a yellow one, lime,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:30.062
purple, red, dark
blue, yellow, orange.

00:11:30.062 --> 00:11:30.645
It's daunting.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.810
There you go.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.350
In that tiny little
chunk of brain,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.050
that is how packed
the cells are.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.840
And the connections
between them are enormous.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.010
And that is just less than
a millionth of your brain.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.980
So to figure out
all the connections,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.260
all the circuitry in the nervous
system, is an enormous task.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.690
And we don't know it.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.940
We'll talk about what
we do know later on.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.850
But I wanted to frame
the problem for you,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.900
so that you have a sense of
where we're trying to go.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.510
Let's go back to the neuron.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.420
And let's talk about
cell type and how

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.880
cell type is important for
thinking about signaling

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.290
in the nervous system.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.530
So like everything
else in the body,

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.330
communication uses
cells as its currency.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.500
And the cell type
is the special kind

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.800
of cell type, which
is the neuron.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:53.380
So neurons are the
connecting/wiring cells.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.140
There's a second type of cell
in the nervous system that

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.350
is really pivotal for
nervous system function that

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.020
are called glia.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.820
And these are cells which are
referred to as support cells.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.230
But that's not really fair.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.980
They guide neurons, and
as we'll mention later,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.130
they also insulate
neurons, so that the wires

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.150
don't short circuit.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.945
So they guide and
insulate neurons.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.630
The structure of the neuron
is important to understand

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.920
its function.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:37.120
Like all cells, it's got
a nucleus and cytoplasm.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.880
And here it is, the
nucleus, the cytoplasm.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.380
And this region of the neuron
is called the cell body.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.280
But unlike other cells,
coming out from this cell body

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.570
there are processes.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.180
And they are very
substantial processes.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:02.970
On one side of the cell body are
usually fairly short processes.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.360
They can be branched, and
there can be bunches of them.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.100
And these are called dendrites.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.010
Dendrites are processes
that receive a signal.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.830
So they are the place where
there is a signaling--

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.450
let me get rid of
that dendrite--

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.915
there is a signaling input.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.010
The signal that
dendrites receive moves

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.430
through the cell body and
into another process, which

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.150
is called the axon
and is very long.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.290
And the fact that
it is very long

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.860
is actually what this
lecture is all about.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.440
So the axon is the wire.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.370
Axons can be up to a meter long.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.420
Here's the axon.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.040
And there are axons that
start in your spinal cord

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.230
and move all the way down
your leg, from a single cell.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.490
We'll talk about why
that is in a moment.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:26.130
These axons branch
at their ends.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.940
And they connect to another
neuron or something else,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.260
but we'll draw another neuron.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:41.040
Here's another neuron with its
dendrites and another axon.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:49.020
The connection-- here is
neuron 1 and neuron 2.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.980
And the connection between
axons and dendrites--

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.040
or as you'll discover,
axons in the cell body--

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.440
is called a synapse.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.860
Some people say synapse--

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.620
that's the connection--
either is OK.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.860
And the thing is
that this input that

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.520
is way over on the left
hand side of the board

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:33.240
is transmitted, along the
axon, into the next neuron,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.710
and then along the next neuron.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.825
This is the signal.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.690
And we have to think
about why cells

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.870
might want to have these very
long processes to do this,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.730
and then how the
signal is transmitted.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.900
The reason that cells have got
these long processes rather

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.400
than--

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.440
well, let's actually
step back a moment.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.210
Let's think about
how cells might

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.290
communicate with one another.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.099
You could imagine a whole
bunch of little round cells,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.700
all lined up, so that
there a meter of them

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.660
that go from your spinal
cord down to your leg.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.030
And that would give you
a chain of communication

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.710
from your spinal
cord to your leg.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.109
And you could have one back
to your brain and so on.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.980
And that in theory
would work OK.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.510
But it turns out that cell-cell
communication is very slow,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.310
and that cells have
figured out a way

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.020
to transmit a signal along their
own length that is very rapid.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.050
You know that there is a
finite time between getting

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.940
a stimulus and a response.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.860
You know, you touch
something hot,

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.770
you can tell it actually takes
a moment before you figure out

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.640
it's hot.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.400
That's the speed of
transmission of the signal, up

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.540
into your brain.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.780
And you say, wow, that's
hot, move my finger.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.840
If you had cells that were
connecting rather than long

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.820
processes of one cell, it
would take you that much longer

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.340
to actually make that--
maybe 10 times longer--

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.780
to make that connection.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.640
And you'd get a
bad burned finger.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.080
So the axon is the thing that
allows rapid transmission

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.665
of the signal.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.400
So the axon is long.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.660
It leads to an
intracellular signal.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:45.220
And this is very rapid, relative
to an intercellular signal.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.950
But how do you transmit
a signal along a cell?

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.320
Well, axons do this by
using movement of ions.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:21.300
So the signal along the axon
is due to movement of ions.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:27.720
And this is called an action
potential, as we will discuss.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.720
And this process draws on
a property of all cells

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.240
that neurons have
capitalized on.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.320
So almost all cells have
got a potential difference

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.530
across their membrane, because
there is a charge difference

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.885
across the plasma membrane.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.480
So almost all cells
have what is called

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.490
a membrane potential, which is
a membrane potential difference.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.210
And in general, cells are more
positive outside than they

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.620
are inside.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.805
So outside the cell--

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.470
and this is worth
your remembering--

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.960
it is more positive.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.100
And it's more positive because
there's a lot of sodium ion.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.360
You'll see the why
this is important.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.700
There's low potassium ion, and
there's some high chloride ion.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.190
But really, the thing
that's important

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:46.350
is that there's very high sodium
concentration outside the cell.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.525
Conversely, inside the cell
is obviously more negative.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.735
Sodium is low.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:06.820
Potassium is higher but
still not very high.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.720
And there's a bunch of ions
that are kind of trapped

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.230
in the cell.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.630
Why is this important?

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.090
Let me see what
I have next here.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.700
OK, most cells show a
potential difference.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.420
Here it is.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.310
Here is written the
potential difference.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.590
Neurons are somewhere
between minus 70

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.750
and minus 60
millivolts, where you

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.870
are talking about the
relative potential difference

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.570
inside to outside,
that's why it's negative.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.940
And you can see
tumor cells actually

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.640
have got a very low membrane
potential, which may or may not

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.580
be significant.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:54.580
What is the nature of
the signal that neurons

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:02.560
use to transmit from the
input, along the axon,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.510
to the next cell?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.420
Particularly, what
is the signal that's

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.330
transmitted along the axon?

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.440
And the answer is something
called an action potential.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:26.760
It's the signal transmitted
along the axon, the wire

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.290
that I referred to.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:38.190
And an accident potential, which
I'm going to abbreviate as AP,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.030
will define--

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.980
and you'll understand
this in a moment--

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.810
as a local, transient
depolarization.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.410
Local, transient--
just lasts a moment--

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.430
depolarization, change
in membrane potential.

00:23:00.494 --> 00:23:02.410
And I'm going to do most
of this on the board.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.826
You have a hand-out,
but I'm going

00:23:03.826 --> 00:23:06.490
to do most of this on the
board because it works better

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.100
as a conversation
than a demonstration.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.630
Let's draw a a bit of an axon.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.730
Here is the axon.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:22.330
Two plasma membranes--
outside, inside, outside.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.345
So this is the axon.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.920
Plasma membrane, PM.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.820
And what we are going to do--

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.690
and here is a cytoplasm--

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.250
what we are going to do is
take a chunk of the axon

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.180
and blow it up and focus on
just one plasma membrane,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.290
on one side of the axon,
and look and see in detail

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:48.620
what is going on there.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.840
So let's take this
chunk and blow it up,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.420
so that we now have the plasma
membrane--and you remember

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.690
it's a lipid bilayer.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.480
But I'm drawing it
as a single line,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.910
because it's really
a pain control

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.390
to draw it as a lipid bilayer.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.710
But you know it's
a lipid bilayer.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.980
On one side-- and here
is outside the cell

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.200
and inside the cell.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.190
On one side, there are
lots of positive charges.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.670
And on the other side, there
are fewer and relatively more

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.450
negative charges.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.420
When the axon looks like
this, with this balance

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.610
of positive and
negative charges,

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.790
it's said to be at
resting potential.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:45.255
And resting potential is
about minus 60 millivolts.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.650
OK, what's our goal?

00:24:52.650 --> 00:25:07.470
Our goal is to start
here, at this asterisk,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.590
and to transmit a
signal along the length

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.150
of this piece of axon and
to transmit the signal

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.300
in a directional way.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.160
So our goal is to transmit
a directional signal.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.140
Let's draw three time
points, each of which

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.630
have a plasma membrane of this
particular segment of axon.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.490
And let us--

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.180
I'm going to move over a bit,
to this side of the board--

00:25:53.180 --> 00:26:01.400
let's have them
here, here, and here.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.420
And so we're going to have a
time vector going diagonally

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.550
across the board.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:12.650
And we started
off with something

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:16.140
that looked like
it did on the board

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.020
above at resting potential.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.400
And now, we're going to-- over a
very short segment of membrane,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.380
we're going to reverse
the membrane charge,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.300
or the cell's going to do it.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.820
So that on the
outside now, there's

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.240
a little part of
the membrane that's

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.630
negative outside
and positive inside.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:42.870
And the rest is positive
outside and negative inside.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:57.240
Over time, this is called a
depolarization, a reversal

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.510
of the membrane potential.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:05.500
Over time, that depolarization,
that initial depolarization

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.760
is going to rectify.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.400
It's going to go
back to how it was.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.360
So you'll get positive
charges outside again.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.720
But the segment of membrane next
door is going to depolarize,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.520
so it now becomes negative
outside and positive inside.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.660
And the rest is positive
outside and negative inside.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.200
That little piece of
membrane, the second--

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:40.970
so that's depolarization
1, here's depolarization 2.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.860
Again, over time, you're
going to get rectification

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.340
of that second depolarization.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.560
And you've got
the idea now, it's

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.890
going to move further
down the axon.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.280
So here is depolarization 3.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.920
And you recall that this is
outside and inside the axon.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.720
So if you look at my diagram--

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.480
I haven't given
you any mechanism--

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.980
but you can see here we
have got a signal that

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:23.110
is moving in this
direction, along the axon.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.360
Each of these depolarizations
that I've drawn

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.300
is called an action potential.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.800
And I'll give you, in a
moment, some more properties,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.310
so that you'll know an action
potential when you see one.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.680
But there are a couple
of questions that arise

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.410
from this easy-to-draw diagram.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.330
Firstly, how does
this really happen?

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.930
How do charges reverse
across the membrane?

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.440
Secondly, why is the
signal unidirectional?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.450
Why doesn't it go backwards?

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.110
And thirdly, how do you
reset the depolarization

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.131
once it's happened?

00:29:07.131 --> 00:29:08.630
And all of these
things you will see

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.230
are connected, but let's
raise these questions.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.415
So how does this happen?

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.300
Why is it unidirectional?

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.770
And what does it mean--

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:32.950
or what is the
mechanism of resetting

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.940
the membrane potential, after
a depolarization has happened?

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:44.530
As for example here, you have
reset the membrane potential.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.240
So the answer to all
of this is complex.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.320
And we'll answer it in chunks,
as we tend to do in this class.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.290
And the first thing we'll
answer with respect to

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.230
is changing membrane potential.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:17.390
Let's start off again with
our axon chunk, with outside

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:24.200
and inside, and the
charge distribution

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.900
that is at resting potential.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.880
And along comes
some kind of input.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.700
It might be touch, it
might be another neuron

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.620
touching a second neuron.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.800
It might be vision,
light, that comes along,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.390
some kind of input.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.610
Here it is.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:52.590
And this input acts on a very
local part of the membrane.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.700
And it changes the
membrane potential

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.240
just a tiny bit, such that
the membrane potential might

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.090
reach something called
threshold potential.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.230
So let's look,
let's draw it out.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.840
Here it is.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.420
Just over a one little
tiny bit of the membrane,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.310
there's some kind
of charge reversal.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.775
The positive charges come from
outside, and they move inside.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.750
And we'll call this potential
difference threshold potential.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.620
And if you want a number, it's
about minus 55 millivolts.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.970
What happens after threshold?

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.140
Well threshold, you
understand what threshold is.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.990
It means something
happens because you have

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.490
reached a point of no return.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.440
And what happens is that there
is now an action potential,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.830
and there is a massive
movement of the positive sodium

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.300
ions into the cell.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.140
So from threshold
potential there

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:22.360
is a massive movement,
again out and in.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.720
So now you've got instead
of this little tiny region

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.670
of depolarization, you've got a
large region of depolarization.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.150
So this is a small, depol--

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:43.790
for depolarization-- leading
to a very large depolarization

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.830
of the kind that I drew
on the board before.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:52.270
This large depolarization is
called the action potential.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.630
And it has several properties.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.540
The action potential reverses
the membrane potential

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.620
almost completely.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.800
So now in this region
of the membrane,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.870
it's at about plus
60 millivolts.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.640
So it's a massive
depolarization.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.150
You completely reverse
the ion distribution

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.170
over a small region
of the membrane.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.080
It's very local, however.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.480
An action potential
occurs over--

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.470
or this massive
depolarization occurs over

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.590
about a micron of membrane.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.980
It takes one to two
milliseconds to set up.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.420
It involves the movement of
about 10 to the 5th ions,

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.710
from the outside in.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.930
And I've told you the potential.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.480
The other thing that
is really critical

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.560
that you have to understand is
something called all or none.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.409
The depolarization you get
with an action potential

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.929
is either complete,
or it doesn't happen.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.530
If you reach threshold,
you reverse polarity,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.310
and you get this complete
depolarization to plus 60

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.650
millivolts from minus 60.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.080
You do not get a
partial depolarization

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.440
to plus 10 or 20 or
30 sometimes, or 35.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.460
For a given neuron, you get
a specific action potential.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.030
And it either happens,
or it doesn't happen.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.179
So all on none, very important.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:50.429
No little or big
action potentials.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.230
And now we've got
a depolarization,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.929
but we haven't
answered two questions.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.380
We haven't answered the
question of unidirection,

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.840
and we haven't answered
the question of resetting.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.480
So let's do that
on the next board.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.140
And let's start off, actually,
with an action potential.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.320
And I'm actually going to
draw an action potential, kind

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.395
of in the middle of this axon.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.170
You'll see why.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.720
When you get an action
potential, what's happening

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.230
is that sodium ions are moving
from the outside inside.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.660
And those sodium ions--
because they're just ions--

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.720
will start to diffuse
in the cytoplasm.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.690
And as they diffuse
next door, they'll

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.850
change the membrane
potential, which

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.640
will reach threshold,
which will trigger

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.230
an action potential in the
membrane chunk next door.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.900
And then those
ions will diffuse,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.600
to make the chunk of
membrane next door

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.060
reach threshold potential.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.926
And you'll get an action
potential triggered, and so on.

00:36:05.926 --> 00:36:08.050
But the ions, of course,
because they're just ions,

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:09.560
can move in either direction.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.690
So the ions can move back.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.470
If this is where your
action potential took place,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.660
the ions could move
in that direction

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.120
and trigger an action potential
going back, up the axon,

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.700
towards the cell body.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.360
Why doesn't that happen?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.990
It doesn't happen
because once you've

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.200
triggered an action potential,
that membrane becomes

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.740
refractory, unable to
trigger another action

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.690
potential for a while.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.270
And during that time
where the membrane

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.660
is unable to respond and make
another action potential,

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.410
the ions have diffused away
and gone on down the axon.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.980
And so you get a
unidirectional propagation.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.220
Let's try to draw that out.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.950
So here's an action potential.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:04.525
And the ions that are
moving in will diffuse.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.240
And they will take the membrane
next door to threshold.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:35.230
And so they'll trigger an
action potential next door.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.130
Those ions fusing backwards
can't do anything.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.880
Because once the membrane
has had an action potential,

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.160
it can't have another
one for a while.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:57.580
So this membrane here, next
door to the action potential,

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:08.460
is refractory to
depolarization--

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.020
that is a really
horrendous spelling

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.790
job there, depolarization--

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.590
for some period of time.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:29.470
Let's say for about a second
or a little less than that,

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.790
but somewhere around there.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.310
And so that means that
the action potential

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.540
is unidirectional.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.130
The ions can diffuse
in both directions,

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.970
but the action potential
can only go in one.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:45.395
So that gives you a
direction of your signal.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:51.170
And also, I have
cavalierly drawn on there

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.980
that the membrane potential
reverses and resets itself,

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.920
where the action potential
previously occurred.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.180
And we'll talk about
that more in a moment.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.930
So here, the membrane
potential has reset.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.762
So this is a theoretical walk
through action potentials.

00:39:16.762 --> 00:39:18.220
And I gave you a
bunch of handouts.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.220
But I'm not going to go through
them, because you can use them

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.800
as a test or as an
exercise after class,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.410
to see how much you understood.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.680
One of the things about
conductance along an axon

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.510
is that it's very quick.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:36.070
It takes a very short time
from touching that hot thing

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.500
to realizing you've touched it.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.020
But one of the
reasons it's so short

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.770
is because you're not sending
an action potential all the way

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:47.110
along an axon like
we're drawing.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.600
You don't really
get successive parts

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.880
of the membrane depolarizing.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.160
Because that actually,
although it's faster

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.160
than intercellular connections,
is still quite slow.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.580
So there's a way that a
cell insulates itself,

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.450
an axon insulates itself, to
give you action potentials

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.060
just to particular places.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.590
And that really speeds up
the rate of transmission

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.360
of an action potential.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.550
And I've got that
on the slide here,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.290
and we're right on the board.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:27.820
So that during
depolarization and after

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:33.310
and all the time, ions
leak from the axon.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:46.090
And this decreases the frequency
of action potential formation.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.250
And so what cells do, it's
kind of like a short--

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.870
no, it's not quite
short circuiting,

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.330
but it's a bad electrical wire.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:09.070
And so what the cell has
done is to insulate itself

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.290
with layers of fatty cells.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.470
And these cells are
really kind of amazing.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.900
Most of the cells that
insulates the neurons

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.990
in the nervous system
wrap around the neurons,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.670
as in this diagram.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.490
You can see here is a cell.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:28.330
And these lines are because a
single cell has wrapped itself

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.650
around the neuron.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.140
You know that the plasma
membrane is lipid.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.540
It doesn't conduct
ions, and so you've

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.420
got really a fatty
layer of insulation.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:46.240
And the thing that insulates
the cells is something

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.520
called a myelin sheath, which
is lipid plus some protein.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.080
But it's a really
hydrophobic layer

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.080
that wraps around the
neurons and insulates them.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.300
Along the neurons
that are insulated,

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.540
there are specific places
where there is no insulation.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.540
And that's where action
potentials take place.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:22.545
So action potentials take
place at nods without myelin.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.660
And this is one way that
neurons really speed up

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.700
their conductance rate.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.490
And so I put here action
potential frequency,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.960
but actually that's not correct.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:47.130
I'm going to talk about
rate of transmission.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.200
So how does this
all go together?

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:04.180
Let's look at a movie, where
here's the neuron, and here

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.550
is the axon, transmitting
an action potential

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.470
along its length.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:13.310
And here's a different way of
depicting the action potential,

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.320
as a graph of
voltage against time.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.930
And that's something that
you'll practice in section.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.680
But what I want you
to see is that there's

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.020
an action potential
moving along the axon.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.540
And the axon can transmit
many, many action potentials,

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.330
one after the other,
with a short recovery

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.410
period in between.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.240
We still have not answered
quite the question

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.950
of how action potentials work.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:56.750
And the answer to that is
to consider ion channels

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:09.230
and pumps, because all of
this charge distribution

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.550
doesn't just happen.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.950
It's set up by
the cell, and it's

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:18.650
set up by ion channels and
pumps, which we can write

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:22.910
Regulate Membrane Potential.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:26.255
Let's review very briefly what
ion channels and pumps are.

00:44:26.255 --> 00:44:28.310
We've talked about them a bunch.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.140
But you need to
know some essences

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.390
for this particular module.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.830
Ion channels allow ions across
the membrane by diffusion.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.960
So here is an ion channel.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.720
And I'm drawing a
channel which is open.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:58.430
And the ions move by
diffusion, across the channel.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.820
But there are other
classes of ion channels,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.790
which are not always open.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.326
They are called gated.

00:45:06.326 --> 00:45:07.700
And we talked
about them, when we

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.870
talked about protein secretion,
protein localization.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:26.070
So gated channels under
a particular stimulus

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:33.200
can be closed and then change
to the open confirmation,

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.780
after they've been given
the appropriate stimulus.

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.200
So here there is some
kind of stimulus.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.960
And a channel that
is gated will open.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.620
A third kind of way of getting
ions across the membrane

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:57.280
is to use a pump, where a pump
is localized in the plasma

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.800
membrane as well.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.770
But instead of a
diffusion-governed process

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.740
to get ions across
the membrane, the pump

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.990
is actively moving ions
across the membrane.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:15.150
So ion pumps actively
transport ions.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.010
And they generally require
energy, ATP, in order to do so.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.500
And all of these things
are essential to set

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.500
the membrane potential and
to change it during action

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.050
potential formation.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.101
If we consider the resting
potential-- actually,

00:46:37.101 --> 00:46:38.850
let me see what I have
on the slides here.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.570
This is a really cool thing.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.720
All right, let me get
through our board work,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:59.260
and then we'll do what is
really cool after or on Monday.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.880
In order to set up
the resting potential,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.030
there are several kinds
of channels and pumps

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.320
that you need to be aware of.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.940
One of them-- which is a biggie
and for which a Nobel Prize was

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.900
given some decades ago--

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.110
is called the sodium
potassium pump.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.200
And this is really a big thing.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.480
It's also called the
sodium potassium ATPase.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:36.020
And what it does is to
pump three sodium ions out

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:42.120
of the cell and put two
potassium ions into the cell.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.620
And this is an enormously
important pump for life.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.560
And you can see what it does
is to increase the sodium

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.220
concentration outside the cell
and increase the potassium

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.490
concentration inside.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:01.990
There is also something called
an open potassium channel that

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.270
will allow all this
potassium that's

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.600
being pumped in by the
sodium potassium pump

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.700
to start diffusing
out of the cell.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.850
But in actual fact, it
doesn't all diffuse out.

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.300
Because it hits the positive
charges of the sodium

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.030
ions on the outside, and there's
an electrostatic repulsion.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.750
And so that limits
how much potassium--

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:27.460
by Monday, I will either
be able to speak by Monday

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.190
or I will have
completely lost my voice.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.630
You'll have the option.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:39.760
So the open potassium
channel allows potassium out

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:49.060
by diffusion, until it
is repelled or stopped

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.750
by electrostatic forces
coming from the sodium ions.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.000
And then a third
ion that's open,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.050
an ion channel that's open is
the chloride channel, which

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.536
we won't discuss right now.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.450
During the action
potential, there

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.180
is an enormously
important ion channel

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.270
that is the last thing
I'll mention today.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.150
And that's called the
voltage gated sodium channel.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:49.200
This is an ion channel that,
like many ion channels,

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.420
consists of a
complex of proteins.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.690
We'll make a note of that, I'll
make a note of that next time.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.140
But the voltage
gated sodium channel

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.570
is sensitive to
membrane potential.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.500
And when threshold
potential is reached,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.780
there is a change
in the confirmation

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:16.150
of this channel, which is closed
normally at resting content

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:23.540
but becomes open at
threshold potential,

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:28.790
to lead to the action potential.

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.840
And it becomes open through
actually the sliding

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.630
of one of the alpha
helices that make up

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.090
the proteins of the channel.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.870
And the sliding
alpha helices slide

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.570
because their charges change,
the charges of the amino acids

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.500
change.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.330
And that opens up the channel.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.120
So I'm going to
show you one picture

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.310
of the last of the
sodium channel,

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:54.950
the voltage gated
sodium channel.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:50:59.204
Here it is.

00:50:59.204 --> 00:51:00.120
And then we'll finish.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.350
Take a look at this quickly.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:07.620
Here is the voltage gated
sodium channel closed.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.500
Amino acids blocking
up the pore.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.800
And there it opens up,
to let the ions in.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.530
And we'll finish this on Monday.

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:12.530
CARLA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.200
Good morning.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.237
My name is Carla.

00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:16.570
I'm going to be talking about
a very fundamental concept

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.390
in aerodynamics.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.834
But before I start, have you
all gone in planes before?

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:22.334
Yeah?

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:22.834
OK.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:27.600
Have you wondered, how does
the pilot land the plane?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.160
A little?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.186
All right.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.085
I'm going to explain
two concepts that

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.460
will help you understand how
you actually land the plane.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.640
And these concepts are the
concepts of lift and angle

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.980
of attack.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.520
So I want you to picture a
plane going through the skies.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.390
And in real life, the planes
don't fly perfectly horizontal.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.718
They actually fly at an angle.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:55.900
And we're going to draw a
little plane going at an angle.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.130
And this angle between the
horizontal and the plane--

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.394
it's going to be known as
alpha, the angle of attack.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.770
And it's usually
about 10 degrees.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.830
So that's why it seems
that you're going uphill

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.880
when you walk across a plane.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.310
Now, there are two forces
acting on the plane.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.140
You're going to have gravity--
the weight of the plane,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.450
pulling the weight down.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.690
And you're going to also
have a force upwards that's

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.750
keeping the plane afloat.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.780
And that force is called lift,
which we're going to note by L.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620
Lift is generated as air
rushes through the wings.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.417
The wings are
designed in such a way

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:36.000
that as air goes
through them, they're

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.160
going to generate
a force upwards.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.640
So that's what keeps
the plane uplift.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.840
Now, there's a
relationship between lift

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.574
and the angle of attack.

00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:47.782
And I'm going to illustrate
it in the following plot.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:50.680
So we're going to
have-- on the x-axis I'm

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.510
going to have the angle
of attack, in degrees.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.150
And then for the
y-axis, I'm going

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.810
to have the lift,
which is a force

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.850
and therefore has
units of Newtons.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.745
Now, it is known that at
small angles of attack,

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:09.889
if you increase the angle
of attack a little bit,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.332
you're going to get more lift.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:12.790
So if you increase
it a little bit,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.760
you're going to get more lift.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.384
So you're going to
get an upwards trend

00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:17.514
in the first part of the plot.

00:02:17.514 --> 00:02:20.255
Now, it might be that you have
a very high angle of attack--

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:22.130
that the plane's going
actually really steep.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.675
The flow is going to be
quite adverse to the wings

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:26.990
and they're going to
stop generating lift.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.270
So if you make the
angle even steeper,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.830
you're going to
get even less lift.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040
So that means that in
this part of the plot,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.980
at very high angles
of attack, you're

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.250
going to get even less lift
as you increase the angle.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.530
Yes there's a question.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.030
STUDENT 1: By extreme
angles, do you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.530
mean like, greater that 45
degrees or like 10 degrees?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.740
CARLA: Greater than 15
actually-- greater than 15.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.300
So you have these two regimes.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.906
And there's this mode of
transition in between.

00:02:55.906 --> 00:03:00.218
And the maximum
occurs at 15 degrees.

00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:02.757
And this condition at which
the plane starts to lose lift

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:04.255
is known as a stall.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.590
So when an airplane starts
to lose lift, it stalls.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.230
Now airplanes usually
fly about 10 degrees.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.945
You want the angle
of attack to be high,

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.690
so that you get a
lot of lift, but not

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.460
so high that you will stall.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.020
So to land the plane, what
does a pilot actually do?

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.880
Here approaches the runways at
10 degrees, the normal angle.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880
And when he's about
to hit the ground,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.280
he changes the angle of attack
to 15 degrees and stalls.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.570
So they lose a lot of lift and
they actually crash the plane,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.600
gently to the ground.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.770
All right.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.640
Are there any questions?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.140
Yes.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.440
STUDENT 2: Do the
aerodynamics of the plane

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.570
affect the stall point?

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.566
CARLA: They do.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.190
The stall point
depends on the velocity

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.390
of the plane-- which
the plane's going at,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.740
and the shape of the wings.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.790
But it's usually around 15
degrees for any sort of plane.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.520
There are planes-- the one
that actually can fly vertical,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.780
those ones have other
sorts of control.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.170
The winds are stalling but
they have fancy motors that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.900
can hold that angle.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.740
There was another question.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.240
No?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.760
Yes.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.095
Yes, what's the question?

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:18.136
STUDENT 3: Are the wings
also angled with respect

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:19.198
to the plane?

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:19.739
CARLA: Sorry.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.893
Could you be a
little louder please?

00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:24.710
Could you repeat
the question please?

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.760
STUDENT 3: Are the wings
also angled with respect

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.540
to the plane?

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.970
CARLA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.700
So the question is if the wings
have an angle with respect

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.280
to the plane.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.121
And yes they do.

00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.144
The plane moves
something like this,

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.560
and the wings are
at a small angle

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.218
of 2 to 3 degrees with respect
to the horizontal of the plane.

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:46.650
I'm exaggerating it, but
it is at a small angle.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.650
But then the cross-section
actually changes.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.810
And if you look at the
airplane from the front,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.620
the wings are actually doing
something like this here.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.910
So there's a number of angles
going on with the plane.

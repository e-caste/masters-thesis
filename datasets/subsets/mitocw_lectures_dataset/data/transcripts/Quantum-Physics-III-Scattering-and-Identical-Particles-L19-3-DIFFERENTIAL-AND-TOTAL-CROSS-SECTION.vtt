WEBVTT

00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:01.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.650
So we have set up the problem.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.250
We now have to understand
what is the physics

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.880
of this f of theta and phi.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.060
In a way, solving this
scattering problem

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.060
means solving for
the thetas and phis.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.240
Now, you would say, OK,
that seems reasonable.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.222
You know how the
solution looks far away?

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.430
And that's where you're
going to do the measurements.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.800
That's where you
have the detectors.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.840
So we have to find what
f of theta and phi is.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.260
But suppose you had it.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.130
What have you learned if you
have the f of theta and phi?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.120
So this is what we
need to compute,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.400
and we will build towards
the computation of this using

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.690
what is called partial waves--

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.205
waves and phase shifts.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.200
This will allow us to calculate
the f of theta and phi.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.000
But doesn't tell you yet
what f of theta and phi is.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.190
So the nice thing of
this f of theta and phi

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.910
is that it gives you the
cross section of the process.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.260
So we need to understand
what is the cross section.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.500
So what is a cross section?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.050
It's a way to quantify the
effect of the scattering

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.630
center on the particles.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.605
Suppose you have your
scattering center

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:48.350
and you shoot particles in.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.900
Then you can say, OK, let me--

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.340
let's see with my detectors
how many particles go off

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.140
at an angle theta?

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.570
When you say three
particles per second,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.140
I'm finding as you
should in particles,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.510
I'm getting three
particles per second

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.260
in this detector at this angle.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.820
My detector at this angle
covers a solid angle of 100,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.810
and it's getting three
particles per second.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.050
Then you can say, OK, what
is the area of a target that

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.340
out of the incoming
beam captures

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.470
three particles per second?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.740
And maybe-- there are lots
of particles coming in,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.370
but if you produce
some area, that area

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.970
will capture three
particles per second.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.470
And that would be what we call
the differential cross section.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.010
The value of the area
that captures or just

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.490
whose flux of particles
is precisely what you're

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.000
getting out there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.100
So if you're looking at some
process in which there's

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.410
this incoming particles and
you look at some angle--

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.600
d omega-- where
there's a detector,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.670
a detector that
capture this angle,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.440
you can associate to
this object and d sigma--

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.400
which is a differential
cross section--

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.705
with units of area.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.930
And the physical interpretation
of the d sigma for this--

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.600
the omega-- is that
sigma is the area that

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.460
captures the amount
of flux that you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.410
see going in this direction.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.800
So it's a way this area--

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.040
this differential cross
sections-- give you

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
an iv, or a concrete
representation,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.210
of how big the target is as
seen by the particles that

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.110
are coming in.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.490
I'll write it in a way
that makes it clear.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.444
So d sigma, which is called the
differential cross section--

00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:30.420
differential cross section--
is equal number of particles--

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.890
there's lots of words here,
but it's good to write them--

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:49.530
scattered per unit time
into the solid angle--

00:04:49.530 --> 00:05:06.925
d omega-- divided by the flux
of incident particles, which

00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:11.500
is equal to the
number of particles

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.320
per unit area per unit time.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.350
So it's this ratio.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.260
Number of particles
scattered per unit time

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.020
into solid angle, d omega--

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.290
particles have no units.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.430
Integers scatter per
unit time is 1 over time

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.420
into the solid angle-- d
omega has no units, either.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.030
The solid angle floods of
incident particles is--

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.130
particles that has no
units over area over time.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.510
So here you had over time,
here over time, they cancel,

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.760
this is 1 over area.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.330
That ratio, therefore,
has units of area.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.930
And this is what
I was telling you.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.010
The differential
cross section, which

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.330
is an area, multiplied
by the flux,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.590
gives you the number of
particles per unit time

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.410
that are crossing at
differential cross section

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.340
area.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.770
And those are set
equal to the number

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.590
of particles per unit time that
end up within this solid angle.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.050
So for a given
little solid angle,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.020
you get the d sigma,
which is small, as well.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.470
That's why it's called
differential cross section.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.880
So let's try to show that this
d sigma is really determined

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.250
by f of theta and phi.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.050
This angle-- solid
angle, d omega--

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.180
is happening at some
theta and some phi.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.430
That's a position, the center
of the little solid angle.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.090
A solid angle, d
omega, at theta phi.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.320
So this is our goal
now, to just calculate

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.770
the differential cross section.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.610
OK.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.940
So we have to
compute this fluxes.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.700
We can do it here.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.240
Now, we're not working
with wave pockets.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.800
We're working with
energy eigenstates,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.700
and we're going to have a
little bit of a fun intuition.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.650
We're not-- we're
going to get it right,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.000
but you have to appreciate
it's a little funny.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.630
If I have a little
volume, and I say

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.930
that I find the probability
to find the particle there

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.040
to be 1/2, I would
say that there's

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.980
a half of a particle
in that little volume.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.040
If I have a volume
that whose probability

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.440
to find a particle is 1, I say,
OK, I have 1 particle in here.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.350
That's the rough intuition.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.860
So for wave functions
that are not normalizable,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.480
it's almost like--

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.020
suppose size squared
is equal to 1.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.940
In a momentum, I
can say you would

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.140
be saying like you have a
particle for every unit volume

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.020
where size squared
integrates to 1.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.510
So that's roughly the intuition.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.830
And it's correct,
really, to use it there.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.950
If you think of the flux
of incident particles--

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.180
so incident flux--

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:40.360
flux-- we think of it as
the probability current,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.960
which is number of particles
per unit time per unit area.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:52.090
So it's h bar over m, imaginary
part of the incident flux.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.620
So I should use the incident
wave function, this phi

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.760
of r, gradient phi of r.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:13.260
And phi was e to the ikz.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.310
That was the incident particle.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.460
So this Laplacian gives
you-- not Laplacian--

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.815
this gradient takes a
gradient, it produces an ik,

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:30.930
the rest gets canceled, and
the imaginary part gives you k.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:38.550
So this is h bar k over m
times the unit vector z.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.950
So that's the incident flux.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.870
This can be thought as the
number of particles per unit

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.510
area and per unit time.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.270
You can also think
of it intuitively

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.430
as rho times v.
The incident flux

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.430
is like the incident
current, the current density,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.755
it's rho times v.
rho is phi squared--

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.610
phi squared.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.930
But that's equal to 1.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.430
And the velocity
of the particles

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.940
is the momentum over the mass.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.870
But that's hk over m.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.450
And if I put the direction,
I will have to put the z.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.550
So it's kind of the
same thing, rho v,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.710
the incident flux are all there.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.460
So this is the denominator
of that big formula

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.380
we have there--

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.610
the incident flux.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.070
Then we need the
number of particles

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.920
scattered per unit time.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.040
We could do it with
a flux calculation.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.210
Also, in spherical
coordinates, but I can also

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.730
do it intuitively.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.320
So I'll do it intuitively.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.615
You can try doing it using
a probability current.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.320
So intuitively what do we have?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.640
We have a d omega here.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.650
And let's consider a
little volume element here.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.150
So a little volume element.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.590
Here you have r--

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.360
distance r-- a little vr.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:52.350
So a small volume element here.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.540
And let's calculate how
many particles there are

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.430
in this small little element.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:05.450
So dn is number of particles
in the little volume--

00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:08.545
volume.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.660
So I must square
the wave function

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.270
and multiply by the volume.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.950
That's what you would do.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.600
So what is the square
of the wave function?

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.580
Now, we are talking about
the scattered wave function.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:36.170
So I must take this part
of the wave function

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.680
and square it and
multiply by the volume.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.110
So we will have f of
theta and phi times

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:50.490
e to the ikr over
r, all squared.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.690
So that's the wave
function squared.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:13:02.860
That's psi carat squared times
the air-- volume of this pill

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.075
box is r squared
d omega times dr.

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:12.740
r squared d omega is the
surface area of that little box.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.370
dr is the little length there.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.820
And, therefore, we have
that volume over there.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.510
So things simplify
the n is equal,

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.910
therefore, the r
squared cancels,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:38.130
and it's just f of theta
phi squared, d omega, dr.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:50.450
So with all these
particles-- this

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.820
is the number of
particles inside the box.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.670
But all these particles
will go through

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:05.880
in a little time dt, which is
equal to dr over the velocity.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.030
This is the time to
go through the box--

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.460
through the box.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.380
dt is dr over the velocity.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.670
And the velocity is hk over m.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.880
So dr times the momentum over
the mass, which is hk over m.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.050
OK.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.540
So we have dn, dt.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.870
This is number of particles.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:44.230
We divide them to form number
of particles per unit time.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:54.190
So the ratio dn dt is the
numerator of this quantity

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.370
here--

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:04.670
is numerator dn [? dt. ?]

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.310
And what do we get?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:14.850
The dr cancels and
we're dividing the ndt--

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.470
this factor goes
into the numerator,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:26.670
so we get h bar k over m f
of theta phi squared d omega.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.930
So this is the numerator of
that equation for the d sigma.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.630
So let's compute-- finish that.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.942
We finally-- I'm going to
get off our identification.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.140
And what do we get?

00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:15.220
We get d sigma is
the numerator there,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:24.880
which is this quantity, h
bar k over m f of theta phi

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:34.790
squared times d omega over h
bar k over m, which is nice.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.340
That all going to cancel.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.990
And then we get the nice
formula that we were after.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:50.900
This differential
cross section is just

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.350
determined by the
function f of theta phi

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.300
that we need to calculate.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.790
f of theta phi is our goal.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.950
If we have it, we have the
differential cross section.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.089
Many people write this
formula this way--

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:14.245
d sigma, d omega is
equal to f of theta phi.

00:17:23.924 --> 00:17:25.550
I think that's OK.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.580
I think in many ways
this is a little clearer.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.090
This small little
area associated

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.030
to a small little
angle is given by that.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.045
This is a ratio of differentials
more than a derivative.

00:17:40.045 --> 00:17:44.010
A derivative with
respect to solid angle

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.760
doesn't mean too much, I think.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.590
So-- but this is another
way people write it.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.725
And, finally, people
integrate this total cross

00:17:55.725 --> 00:17:59.930
section is the integral
of the differential

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.930
cross section over--

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.360
looking at all solid angles.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:15.720
So this means integrating f
of theta phi squared d omega.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.875
And that's the
total cross section.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.600
OK.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.520
So we've set up the problem.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.190
We-- what are the main
things that we've learned?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.040
We have the scattering center.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.990
We have our physical
condition of a wave coming in.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.800
Our physical condition
that the wave comes out.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.650
Those are represented here.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.020
And this situation
is saying that this

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.190
is an approximate
solution for a wave--

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:11.100
a wave coming out modulated
by a theta and phi dependence

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.820
and your incoming wave.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:20.580
This modulation is the thing
that captures the effect

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.460
of the potential and associates
to the strength of this

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.640
potential and its ability
to scatter a differ--

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.260
a cross section,
which is measurable--

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.150
which means a probability
of interaction--

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.330
capture the probability
of interaction.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.790
This cross sections
are very important.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.970
When you design an experiment
with an accelerator,

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.990
you want to have a cross
section is sufficiently large,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.690
because this cross section
is going to tell you

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.090
how many particles your
detector is going to get.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.440
Whether with the
flux that you have,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.780
with the beam intensity
that you have,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.470
you're going to get one Higgs
a day, or 500 Higgs's a day.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.780
And it made a
difference for the LHC.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.450
It began with a
few Higgs's a day,

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.190
and later, it's getting a
few hundred Higgs's a day.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.570
So-- so those quantities
are pretty important.

WEBVTT

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.920
PROFESSOR: We're going to start
with the discussion portion,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.968
just to give a little
context to the reading

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:21.885
that we've been doing.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:35.580
I am a big fan of having
designers think about artifacts

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.370
through the lens of
criticism every now and then,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.310
and I have a background
in games criticism.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.060
I did that for about
10 years in parallel

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.380
with my illustrious
academic career

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.050
when I was still in Sweden.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.970
So I also teach games
criticism to unrelated students

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.950
here at MIT.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.900
And when it comes
how to do critiques

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.000
of interactive
artifacts, there's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.880
still a lot of uncertainty
about how to best do it,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.490
and how and why it needs to
be different from criticism

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.610
of film or literature,
or any of these things

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.140
that we've been doing
analysis of since for it.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380
And one of the
approaches is a method

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.840
called interaction criticism.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.780
It's not specifically
designed for games

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.400
or playful interactive
experiences,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:11.280
but just interactive,
non-production-related

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.820
artifacts in general.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.720
And the things we've
been reading today

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.370
is, one, from the originator
himself, Jeff Bardzell.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.400
So we're trying to give an
introduction to the method

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.440
and the theory behind it.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.550
And the other one is him and
two other interaction design

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.280
and media studies
scholars trying

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.010
to apply interaction criticism
to a particular cultural

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.230
artifact, and through
different senses

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.850
and seeing what
they come up with,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.790
and whether that's
interesting and fruitful.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.970
So with that said,
let's start with the one

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.910
called Interaction Criticism,
an Introduction to the Practice,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.150
and put keywords
on the whiteboard.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:21.730
OK, so maybe we
want to start with--

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.620
it doesn't matter
which one of these--

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.190
but subjective.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.353
Who put that there?

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:29.020
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.265
PROFESSOR: OK, hello.

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:35.050
AUDIENCE: OK, so one of
the interesting things

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.360
from this paper I
noticed is that when

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.810
you talk about criticism, it's
someone's judgment on a thing,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.060
and that judgment can
often be subjective.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.280
And so a lot of the
discussion in this paper

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080
is reconciling the clearly
subjective nature of criticism,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.910
but in a way that,
they say, is judgments

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.115
that are subjective,
but non-perspectival.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.260
Is that how you pronounce that?

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.840
PROFESSOR: I think they
probably just made up the word,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.750
so it's your call.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.870
AUDIENCE: I know what they mean,
which ties into perspectives.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.500
But the idea is
that the judgment

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.620
itself comes from, they focus
on critics that are experts

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.530
in their fields, and the
judgments themselves come

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:37.420
from experts who know about many
similar types of interaction, I

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.920
would say.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.800
I don't want to say games,
because it doesn't say games.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no, it
clearly sort of skirts.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.610
So just to interrupt
a little bit.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.280
Specifically, [INAUDIBLE]
is one of the people who

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.500
are applying it in
the second paper,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.270
has said that the only
professional practice

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.410
of interaction criticism
is games criticism.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.230
We don't have any other sort
of interactive art form that's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.580
sort of strong enough
to have people get paid

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.380
to do this kind of criticism.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.710
So for better or
worse, that's kind

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.800
of what we have to
look to as an example.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.300
But especially
Bardzell, I think,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.010
it's very critical to how games
criticism is currently done,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.930
and thinks that
there's a lot to learn

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.210
from other critical
practices, and he

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.740
comes from a background
in those areas.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.240
So yeah, he's not going
to talk about games,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.383
but they're sort of
hovering in there.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.050
AUDIENCE: And he also
mentions, I guess,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.530
also that they're not talking
about amateur critics,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.370
like the people who go on Amazon
or on Steam and rate whatever

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.840
they want to rate.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.930
Because that could be
subjective but very

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.860
based on that person's
own experience

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.200
without trying to see
things in a broader context.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.730
PROFESSOR: So to
begin with, what

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:20.060
do we think of this
idea of a somehow

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.354
more rigorous objectivity?

00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:23.854
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.340
PROFESSOR: Reflections on that?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.030
Yes?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.200
AUDIENCE: I put aesthetics.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.530
And so it's very similar to what
we're talking about right now,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.320
which I find that, throughout
the readings that we've

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.390
been doing, design is in the
middle of science and art.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.960
So a lot of times
there's a temptation

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.400
to do things very
scientifically,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.280
but that fails when aesthetics
come into play, because they're

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.110
very subjective.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.400
And so that's why
we need criticism.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.940
That's what they're
kind of saying.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.870
PROFESSOR: Right, so we don't
have a choice but to rely

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.210
on our subjectivity , because
there's no other rules given

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.130
to us for how to evaluate
this kind of stuff.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.430
It's not just describable.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.310
That misses some
important point.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.450
By the way, I would say
that Bardzell doesn't

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.520
think of design as something
in between science and art,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.570
but rather something
distinctly different from both.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.920
So he wants it to
be its own thing.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.820
But yes, clearly, all
the sources that he

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.680
is borrowing on
when he's creating

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.620
this method coming from one
or the other, so there's that.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:09.040
But yes, and those were the
word pair I was thinking of,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.790
when I said we could
start in either end.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:19.960
But then what goes
into this expertise

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.400
that he talks about how?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.260
Do we justify that someone's
subjective opinion of something

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.610
is more, weighs heavier
than someone else's?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:36.549
What makes up for the
difference between a critic

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.580
and someone on Amazon?

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.799
AUDIENCE: Well,
knowledge about the field

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.430
and having a very
broad experience,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.300
and I guess the people
who you are critiquing,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.720
or who are reading
the critiques,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.880
knowing that you have
that broad experience.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.600
Someone that got an
espresso machine off Amazon

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.580
might leave a terrible
review being like, oh,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.640
it didn't just instantly
make me coffee, one star,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.610
because they don't understand
how the espresso machine works,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.980
or what the different
grades might be,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.320
or how any of the different
pieces of the process work.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.590
Whereas the critic who will
have value behind what they say

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.290
understands the whole
field, and how this helps,

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.210
and what place it has,
and what the context

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.690
of it, and like other good
works in the field are.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.920
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.110
So a good example,
so this is one

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.310
of those things that are
often highlighted in design

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.310
educations, and I probably have
said the word a couple of times

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.760
during the semester as well.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.950
So the way we educate
ourselves in design

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.500
is often looking
at what has been

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.230
established as good examples.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.530
And they're good just because
someone decided they were good.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.170
There's nothing in
nature determining

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.740
that they're good other than
ourselves and our community,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.330
but that has an important
role, I would say,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.110
within games criticism.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.460
There's nothing that
speaks as loud as having

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.030
this almost data-based knowledge
of the history of video games

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.700
when you get
interviewed for writing

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.290
for a website or a journal,
or something, magazine,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.820
I should say.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.100
That's what they
question you on,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.130
do you know about this
and that, and that

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.970
is the most important
criteria for whether you're

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.762
going to get the job or not.

00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:28.750
AUDIENCE: It's, do
you know the history?

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.950
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.120
And that is one of the things
that Bardzell would say

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.280
is the problem with
games criticism.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.950
What do you think
could be potentially

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.490
an issue with that
kind of filter

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.736
for who gets to be a critic?

00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:48.172
AUDIENCE: I'm not playing games
to know the history of games.

00:10:48.172 --> 00:10:48.880
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.850
But yeah, they actually expect
you to not just know it,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.870
but have played it.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.940
So the most well-played,
if we can make up a word

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.620
based on well-read, so the
most well-played people

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.440
tend to get the jobs as critics.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.190
But is there a
problem with that?

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.800
And what would that--

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.480
and now we're sort of
off the paper already,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.430
but we'll get back to it.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.710
AUDIENCE: There's sort of a
disconnect between someone

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.750
who has played a lot
of games, with someone

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.060
who has played no games.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.927
But, yes.

00:11:26.927 --> 00:11:28.760
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean,
it was a good point.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.850
It would be difficult for the
folks who played a lot of games

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.350
to be able to even translate
their thoughts to someone who's

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.370
never played those games.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.810
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's
what you were saying.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.200
So yes, you will be a little
bit like, let's say, a jazz

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.680
critic that just listens to--

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.685
AUDIENCE: Coltrane.

00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:55.810
PROFESSOR: Well, not even--

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.180
Coltrane is for the masses.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.180
They're beyond Coltrane.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.390
They might be talking above
the heads of most people,

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.800
so there's a disconnect
with the audience.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.960
So that might just make
the criticism very insular

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.610
and not really sort
of reach the audience

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.980
who might be interested
in evaluation

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.455
of these cultural artifacts.

00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:28.060
So that, I think, is
a very good point.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.010
Anything else along those lines?

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.320
AUDIENCE: So what a
fix to accommodate

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.530
for that be to ask
for a writing sample

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.540
and actually judge
whether or not

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.600
that person can communicate at
multiple levels of an audience?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.550
PROFESSOR: Actually,
the most important skill

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.120
is not being a very
knowledgeable gamer,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.320
but being a good writer.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.010
Because without that
skill, you get nowhere.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.870
And no one's going to
read you, basically,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.310
because you write like
a robot, or something.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.550
AUDIENCE: Actually, I want to
say even the converse might

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.820
actually be true, of trying to
look for people who don't sort

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.030
of toe the line of
traditional game criticism

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:20.290
and become a lot more sought
after and invited now.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:26.590
So folks who are
expressly stating opinions

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.630
from or analyzing
games are coming up

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.310
from the lens of
something that's

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.480
not like traditional
games criticism.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.060
It seems, in this
click-hungry media

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.080
landscape, seemed actually to be
a lot more interesting to read.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.580
So they're good
writers, and they're

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.140
bringing a new perspective.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.820
PROFESSOR: And I think
for, among other things,

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.890
one important reason is
that there is an existing

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:03.520
hegemony around the field of
what a good game is and should

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:10.840
be that may be based on
assumptions about gender

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.380
and culture that
should be questioned.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.430
It might be white men writing
for white men, basically,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.390
of a certain age.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.820
And if we think,
especially back in time,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.520
playing video games,
having grown up

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.940
playing all these games
on all these consoles

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.840
implies a very
strong privilege when

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.980
it comes to finance,
your family's finances,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.090
for instance.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.520
Consoles used to
be, I mean, they

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.620
used to cost the same
as they cost today.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.780
Games used to cost the
same as they cost today,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.920
but that was a lot more
money in the '80s and '90s

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.860
than it is now.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.030
So someone who had access to all
of the existing home consoles

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.340
was probably a rich kid.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.150
So those were the ones who
became reviewers and decided

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.300
what a good game is.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.640
So there's something about
looking to those good examples

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.290
that could also need some
questioning, and we might need

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.800
to break with those
traditions and look

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.690
at other potential values
in interactive artifacts

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.910
as the ones that
we are creating,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.710
those that are maybe
more inclusive,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.850
or taking other
skillsets to heart,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.750
rather than just excellent
hand-eye coordination,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.970
or whatever it is that
makes a good gamer.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.340
AUDIENCE: Before we leave
this, just one more angle

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.480
I want to bring up, which is,
even if you were expressly

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.150
looking for people
who state that they

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:57.550
have a long history with games
and can bring up this catalog,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.290
which history, right?

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.200
Because in games, or
even digital games,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.020
and extend it out to
non-digital games,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.030
to board games or
tabletop and sports,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.900
then it's like each
country, each region

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.360
has its own history,
and people consider

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.220
different things canonical.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:24.820
So a lot of American white
men writing for white boys

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.620
pretty much have a
fairly lacking experience

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.950
of Eastern Bloc
games, even games

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.040
that were released in
Asia, for instance.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.500
Only a few Japanese games are
sort of re-released in America.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.340
And they think that's
all of Japan, right?

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.850
And it's like, no, that's not--

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.210
that's part of Japan,
and not even all of Asia.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.650
So that would be an example.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.358
That will be another
problem, is that you

00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:55.520
assume that a long
history implies

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.870
a comprehensive history.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.920
But no one really has a
comprehensive specific history

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.730
with the entire world's
history of games.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.000
PROFESSOR: And
that criticism has

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.900
been put towards design
studies, as well.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.569
I mean, we are reading
three white men

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.150
of a somewhat certain
age here today.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.780
So they are, to some
extent, myopic, as well,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:33.890
when it comes to cultural
values in these artifacts.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.850
And I was thinking maybe
we can get back on track

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:44.290
by inviting whoever put
perspectives on there.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.370
AUDIENCE: It was me.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.060
They were talking in this
article about the four

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.740
perspectives of,
was it the designer,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.700
the user, where they, like the--

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.920
AUDIENCE: Artifact and society?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.580
Artifact and society?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.802
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:03.802 --> 00:18:05.760
It was sort of what I
was talking about before.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.450
It's like someone who
is very well-played

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:14.580
is going to have a different
interaction with the artifact,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.220
compared to someone who does
not play a lot of games.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.200
You have to consider a lot
of different perspectives,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.990
and it's very easy to get stuck.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:27.210
And the idea is, you
get stuck in one.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.300
A creator can't see
their own problems,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.170
a lot of the time, which
is why you need criticism.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.620
And the criticiser doesn't
have the perspective

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.670
that the creator does.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.380
PROFESSOR: So
that's, I mean, one

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.030
of the reason we
have criticism is

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.450
to try to improve whatever
field we are critiquing.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.990
So it's supposed to be
a help for the designers

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.090
to see things that they can't
see themselves, as well.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.860
And what I would do, if
this was a longer class,

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.640
I would have you write up
critiques of each other's work.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.240
But we're just, we have
so much work to do,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.260
so we don't quite
have time for it.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.830
So I don't want to sort
of burden you with that.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.410
But it is a very interesting
exercise, because you instantly

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.428
see that people see things in
the thing you've been making

00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:19.970
that you didn't see
yourself, and you

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.850
thought you saw all
of it, because you're

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.040
so engaged with it.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:33.230
This is also something
that breaks with tradition

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:39.410
of old-school
literary theory, which

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.840
used to be very heavily
focused on artifacts.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:48.380
So you wanted to
just look at the text

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.490
and see what the meaning
of the text really is.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.920
It comes from religious
studies of trying

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.740
to figure out what the
Bible is telling us to do,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.790
or something like that.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.750
But that was what the
academic study of literature

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:08.000
used to be, as well,
what is the author's

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.150
intentions with this
text, and try to sort

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.940
of just reverse engineer.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:20.120
Nowadays, we read, and we
can talk about all kinds

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.740
of artifacts as texts.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.650
It seems a little weird
to do that, call a game

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.100
a text, for instance.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.220
But if you think of the Latin
origin of the word, which

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.670
textera basically means
more like a texture,

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.310
like something that's
woven together,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.980
then it's easier to
think, talk and think

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.250
about things as texts other
than written words on a page.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:52.730
So when we interpret texts, now,
through interaction criticism,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.750
for instance, we very
much take into account

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.800
the context it is used in.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.230
Because we think
that there isn't just

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.720
one meaning of a
cultural artifact.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.330
It actually changes
meaning depending

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.376
on who is interacting with it,
and under which circumstances.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.880
And that is something that has
changed literature studies, as

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:28.010
well, the idea of it
being someone encountering

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.180
the text, which you can hear
in the name of reader response

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.400
theory for instance,
which is, it's

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.250
not just about what Shakespeare
meant when he wrote the text.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.320
It's about how a reader now can
respond to a text like Hamlet

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.560
that is of interest.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.730
So this is very much based
on that tradition of,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:58.670
we are doing a reading not
just of the artifact itself,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:04.550
but the context of use and
the identity of the user,

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.300
and so forth.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.250
OK, so what you have left,
let's talk about a little bit

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.015
about balance.

00:22:15.705 --> 00:22:17.080
AUDIENCE: So I
put that up there,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.810
and it was mostly
about, he was talking

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.700
about how, with the
criticisms, there's somewhat

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.360
trying to strike this balance
between historical context,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.540
cultural significance, and
technical descriptions,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:40.210
and how do you, so how do you
balance the different elements

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.590
that you should be looking at?

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.450
Because these are
all different lenses

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.908
that a different person might
evaluate through differently,

00:22:45.908 --> 00:22:47.860
especially based on
what field they're

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.520
in that is not interaction
design, or interaction

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.440
criticism for design.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.920
But scientific design is very
much of the, how this was done,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.560
or [INAUDIBLE],, how was
this done, empirical facts.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.590
And so there's a lot
about different ways

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.570
to focus those designs, to
focus the criticism based

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:17.830
on the different
aspects that you can

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.470
be trying to evaluate through.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.550
PROFESSOR: And that is
what, I think, for Bardzell,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.400
that is one of the
things that creates

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.830
the need for
interaction criticism.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.480
Because that's somewhat alien to
someone who is doing criticism

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.060
of movies or literature.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:44.140
To them, it's perfectly
fine to look at it as just

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:51.700
something that is being
evaluated for its aesthetics,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.050
end of story.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.500
Well, when we evaluate
a game, let's say

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.060
you're driving a
car in the game,

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.290
and the steering
works very poorly.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.160
It's just, there's a
usability issue there

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.880
that's very similar to
when we evaluate cars.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.960
So if the steering
is bad, that's

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.070
going to affect the quality
of this kind of artwork thing,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.440
but it's a very sort of
usability-centered thing.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.750
So games and
interactive artifacts

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:31.000
live in this weird space where
these things come together,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.420
and all of them matter.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.280
So some of it is just
matter-of-factly,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:43.120
this steering wheel is bad,
while some of it is like,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.800
the scenery of the
car ride in this game

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.160
evokes emotions, a lot of that.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.100
So to me, it's what makes
interaction design cool,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.830
because it has all of these
very different qualities to it,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:08.530
and they can be
foregrounded or sort of

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.630
be more part of the periphery.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:16.300
But they all have to work in
concert for an interaction

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.310
design for the unity, or organic
unity of it, as Bardzell says,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.150
to click.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.730
OK, so I guess we
just have framework.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.290
So let's do that one as well,
so you don't feel left out.

00:25:35.305 --> 00:25:35.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.620
I put framework,
because this article

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:45.952
is a lot about developing
a way to criticize

00:25:45.952 --> 00:25:47.100
interactive material.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:55.800
And I think it mentions how it's
about developing skills that

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.334
enable people to think
about interaction.

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:04.740
And so that's why I thought
framework was a good word.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.000
I mean, that's what
he's doing here.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.440
So it's a somewhat
ambitious project

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.930
to sort of establish,
starting the establishment

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:24.240
of a framework that goes outside
of the tradition of HCI, which

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.130
is much more usability-focused,
on and without losing

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:34.080
those qualities, still capturing
the things that sort of fall

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.320
through the net of what
that type of criticism

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.210
or that type of evaluation
captures in an experience.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.930
OK, are we ready
for paper number

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.570
two, looking at the
actual application

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.920
of interaction criticism?

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.330
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:54.955
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:26:54.955 --> 00:26:56.440
AUDIENCE: What's
the difference--

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.310
so there are-- correct me if I'm
wrong-- there are car critics,

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.810
right?

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.050
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.480
AUDIENCE: There are people who
review cars professionally.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.240
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference, would that

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.100
be considered a form of
interaction criticism

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.970
of design?

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.678
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:12.678 --> 00:27:18.438
So I think that, to
Bardzell, it doesn't.

00:27:18.438 --> 00:27:19.440
AUDIENCE: It's not.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.880
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.610
Because the focus is so much
on the usability aspects.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.652
AUDIENCE: Not on,
like, the interior.

00:27:29.652 --> 00:27:30.360
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.280
I mean, we do sometimes
see that kind of approach,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.940
where someone is sort
of trying to focus more

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.090
on the experience of a car,
or something like that.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:47.430
And that's when it starts
coming closer to that line.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.570
So he talks about,
not in this paper

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.560
but in another sort
of parallel paper,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.260
he talks about interior
design and things like that,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.440
that there's definitely
touch points.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.590
And when we start talking about
stuff like the sound design,

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.360
what sound a car door
makes when it closes,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.120
that's very carefully
designed nowadays.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.250
And that is part of the
aesthetic experience

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.140
of the car.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.430
AUDIENCE: So just going back
to balance, there could be a--

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.430
one-dimensional, might
be two, three dimensions,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.888
but there's aesthetics
on one side,

00:28:27.888 --> 00:28:31.570
and usability, technical
details on the other.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.940
And car critics fall much closer
to the technical usability

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.510
side.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.410
Interior design falls much more
towards the aesthetic side.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.760
But interior design, so
maybe it's not a line.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.190
Because interior design,
interior design critique

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.980
is still very far from
traditional literary theory.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.340
So maybe it's some
kind of weird polygon.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.150
I don't think it's
even a triangle.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.800
But yeah, it's a field
where he sort of tries

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.580
to visualize some of the--

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.350
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah,
the seven values.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:22.240
PROFESSOR: Right, but maybe
not necessarily all of them.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.680
I don't think he tries to
be comprehensive of what

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.360
that space looks like.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.710
But I feel like the
paper is still written

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.450
as a critique of HCI study.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.590
So that's the one he
wants to focus on,

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:41.790
like you guys are missing
things when you decide what gets

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.075
accepted to Chi, or something.

00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:44.700
AUDIENCE: But that's
the context of why

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.610
he's publishing it, right, is
interacting with computers,

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.930
in part, is the magazine,
or is the journal.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.097
And I'm curious about
that other people

00:29:54.097 --> 00:29:55.680
that you're describing,
because you're

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.930
talking about interior design.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:00.480
I'm thinking there's got to be
architectural criticism that's

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.100
a fairly well-established
field, and the only difference

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.520
that I see between what he's
arguing in architectural design

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.630
is the use of computers in
his what he's describing.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.540
We're talking about concrete,
and steel, and wood,

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.870
and other kinds of materials,
but everything else,

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.745
architecture is just as
interactive as anything

00:30:21.745 --> 00:30:22.620
built by interaction.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.930
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.640
The outside of academia
professional core

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.730
of architectural
critics is very small.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.610
So I don't think it reaches--

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.750
so [INAUDIBLE] said it's
only the games that really

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.230
have an established core of
professional critics outside

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.920
of academia.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.490
And I think it
means he's thinking

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.730
that the architectural
critics are [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.008
AUDIENCE: I mean, that's
perfectly fine to argue that it

00:30:54.008 --> 00:30:55.050
should be a larger thing.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.400
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.920
And I also think that, when
we look towards architecture,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.910
we're also seeing
this transition where

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.080
they try to focus
more on experience

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.060
and different perspectives,
rather than saying

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.270
that the quality of the
architecture is in the artifact

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.200
itself.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.250
It used to be, if you look
at architecture education,

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.740
the good examples
was very much about,

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.890
like, this is good
because this and this

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.510
and this, rather
than talking about,

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.810
it's good from this perspective,
because this and that.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:39.330
So there is that movement
within architectural criticism,

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.850
as well, to go, maybe--

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.750
I usually have architecture
students in the other classes,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.030
and they always giggle
when I mention Gary.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:56.610
Because within architecture,
he's seen as kind of a fad,

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:01.995
and we have a big wonky
example of that here on campus.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.030
So that sort of focus
on the beautiful shapes

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.120
and all of that, it's a little
old school now in architecture,

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.530
and now it's more about,
how livable is this,

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:23.250
or how well can you work
in that weird bubble.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:27.420
And it turns out not very well.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.580
AUDIENCE: Just as literary
criticism and, no doubt,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.122
interactive design
criticism is going

00:32:31.122 --> 00:32:35.790
to go through these waves of
different styles of criticism,

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.190
and they don't
invalidate the old ones.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.250
They just add to how we
look at the same thing.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.370
PROFESSOR: Right, but they
might invalidate decisions

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.590
to hire certain architects
to do certain flagship

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.900
buildings on campus,
or something like that.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.692
I don't think that
choice would be made--

00:32:53.692 --> 00:32:54.900
AUDIENCE: Based on criticism?

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well
based on, oh, yeah,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.710
that was maybe cool because
the methods were new,

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.660
and they're not so new anymore.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.890
So yeah, it's a little bit of
that hype thing has done away

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:16.230
from, oh, we can actually
have computers design curves

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.020
that we couldn't
calculate before

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.490
if they would be load-bearing.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.990
AUDIENCE: Certainly, at MIT,
because we have an architecture

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.450
department and
architecture faculty,

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.483
criticism must influence
the choice of architects.

00:33:31.483 --> 00:33:32.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.810
I mean, I think for one
thing, the MIT campus has

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:43.770
a lot more examples of
high-profile architectural

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.110
buildings than almost
any other campus,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:51.780
because we have such a prominent
architecture department,

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.790
and through a series of
styles that don't necessarily

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.320
always fit together.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.265
AUDIENCE: They don't.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:03.580
A scrapbook.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.438
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
very much a scrapbook.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.530
Anyway, that's a little
bit of a tangent.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:17.560
So any other thoughts
on the Bardzell paper,

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.330
before we leave?

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:20.909
We're good?

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.210
OK, now let's do
keywords for a second.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.750
OK, so I'm tempted to--

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:48.380
we had perspectives in the last
paper, and now we have lenses.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.659
So maybe we can
start with lenses,

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.500
and they can describe what
the difference between a lens

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.489
and a perspective is.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.130
AUDIENCE: So I specifically said
lenses, because perspectives

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.170
can mean personal perspectives.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.540
You might have a very
different perspective of a game

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.210
than I do, because of
our personal backgrounds,

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.377
and likes, and whatnot.

00:35:06.377 --> 00:35:08.210
But the lenses are more,
you're viewing this

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.370
through a
performance-based lens,

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.620
you're viewing this through
an interaction-based lens,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.890
you're viewing this through the
context of a particular thing.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.550
So perspectives can be
that, but it can also

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.700
be through your self, or
through how we use it,

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.980
or how certain
people might feel.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.973
There's why I
specifically said lenses.

00:35:27.973 --> 00:35:28.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.100
And I think, yeah, that's
spot-on, what they mean,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.600
as well.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.270
It's more like, I,
as a person, choose

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.070
to put on this
lens, a little bit

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.860
like you might switch
the lens for your camera

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.930
for a particular purpose.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:49.315
OK, so did you have more
to say about your word?

00:35:49.315 --> 00:35:49.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.480
So one of the big
things, as he's

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.147
talking about in this paper, is
how through different lenses,

00:35:56.147 --> 00:35:58.730
the same thing can be viewed in
very different lights, or very

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:02.420
different ways, or come out very
differently in the criticism.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.730
So he has the three different
criticism points of Maeve,

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.000
and is saying at
the end about how,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.160
just because of these lenses,
the criticism of either

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.410
the interaction, the
performance, or the users

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.850
comes through differently.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.790
I think we should be able to
jump to almost any of the words

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.560
from there.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.480
Let's maybe do interface first.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.830
AUDIENCE: OK, so one of
my favorite sentences

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:47.170
in this article is that
form and content, interface

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.450
and information are inseparable.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.500
And interface describes
how you interact

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.460
with the information that's
being presented to you,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.030
and can greatly influence how
you interpret the information

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.250
that is presented to you.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:07.630
They use, as an
example, I think it

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.840
was like a Java applet,
the word synonym finder,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.210
this visual synonym finder.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.090
I actually have a memory
of using this way back

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.330
in the day, the
early internet days,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.790
of having it in this
bubble on the screen.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.060
PROFESSOR: Early
world wide web base.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.120
Internet is, you weren't around.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.040
AUDIENCE: No, that's true.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.870
That's what I meant.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.380
Back in the days when
dial-up was a thing.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.350
So I remembered that
experience, and so that was a--

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:52.010
the way that they frame it is
that experience of seeing words

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.608
and connection to
other words, and how

00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:56.150
they relate to each other, and
being able to make these hops,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.027
these may small hops, but end
up very far away from the word

00:37:59.027 --> 00:37:59.735
that you started.

00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:02.870
It makes language more
fluid, instead of like,

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.690
when you read a dictionary,
which has basically the same

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:10.070
information-- it contains
words and what they mean--

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.940
but it's presented in this
very logical, strict manner.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.920
And similarly, with
this Maeve project,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.540
you can think of
it as, oh, you just

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.910
have a collection of
files on different--

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:29.750
I think it's architectural,
this architectural project--

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.177
and you could click through
the files, or something,

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:33.510
have it on your computer screen.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.910
But now they've turned it
into, basically, the users

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.860
of the system are performers.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.860
What they choose to view gets
presented on a larger screen,

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:53.050
and they also get to see
how they're, like the cards

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.290
that they choose, relate to
things that other users are

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:56.920
choosing.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.710
And this adds like
a social element,

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.450
a performative element,
and greatly changes

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:11.560
the way users can see how
each of these different cards

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.410
are, like they can actually
see more direct comparisons

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.370
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.110
So yeah, I [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:20.820
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.970
Yeah, that's a
pretty powerful idea.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:28.710
I think that it's not just
a quantitative difference

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.440
between different interfaces.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.060
Another example would be
the physical typewriter

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.740
versus a word processor.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.940
It's not just that the word
processor makes it easier

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.750
or faster to produce text.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.320
We actually write
different things.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.400
We think differently because
of this word processor

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.760
working in a certain way
than we used to think

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.470
when we had typewriters.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.640
It's somehow changed
the world, and not just,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.560
again, quantitatively,
but qualitatively.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:11.010
People understand
texts and themselves

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:16.410
differently because of
this change of interface.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.670
And this is just an
extension of that,

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:27.090
where we can understand
another data set completely

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:31.740
differently, depending on how
it is, not just presented to us,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.290
but how we are allowed
to interact with it.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:42.570
We will get back a
little bit to the idea

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:50.430
of being able to interact
with ideas next week,

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.250
when we're going to
start thinking about how

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.260
to disseminate the
knowledge that we're

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.114
generating in this class.

00:40:57.114 --> 00:41:00.570
But I leave that there, for now.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.320
I'm just going to
keep going here.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.515
Distinction?

00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:09.140
AUDIENCE: That was me.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:14.180
The article was talking a lot
about how, increasingly, we're

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:20.210
splitting form and function,
and the ideas, the information

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.670
you want to convey to
the user and the way

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.490
that you do that are
considered differently,

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.380
and that that's
not a good thing.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.540
It's like the idea of using
the lenses and the interface,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.230
the stuff we've been talking
about, to mix the two,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.110
because it's often
more successful.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.730
You want to get the--

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.680
I'm just going to use
play a game-- you want

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.390
to get plot information
across to the player,

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.310
because it's a
story, but you also

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.350
want them to have
fun while doing it

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.660
and interact with the story.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.510
So they were talking
about the idea

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.750
of performative experiences.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:09.220
PROFESSOR: That goes very much
along the same lines of what

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.510
we were talking about, with
the interfaces, I think.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:18.470
Let's keep on going,
the information.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.880
The reason I put
that down was also

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.810
because of the
way the paper said

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.840
that interface and
information are inseparable.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.230
PROFESSOR: I see you've all
caught on to the same idea.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:40.210
I guess that is the big
takeaway from this paper.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:46.510
And it's all, I think, the same
sort of criticism of, maybe,

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:53.620
specifically in software
engineering, for reasons

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.640
of dealing with complexity,
we divided different aspects

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.250
of these artifacts
into different roles,

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.540
and different teams.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.750
And it turns out it's
kind of a suboptimization,

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.670
because it all has
to work in concert,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:13.280
or it's not going
to be successful.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.900
And sort of trying
to find a way back

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:27.340
to ideas of the designer and
the one actually manufacturing

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.020
something being the
same person, where

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:36.100
they have full control over
all aspects of it, to how can

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:42.220
we have complex development
with a lot of people involved,

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:49.570
and still not lose touch of the
organic unity of the thing, how

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.320
it all relates to each other.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.590
Did performance
have anything else

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.810
to add that hasn't
come up already?

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:03.900
I feel like we're beating
this to the ground.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.040
AUDIENCE: More information?

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.800
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.000
Yes, if there was something
that you felt hasn't been--

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.760
AUDIENCE: Well,
I guess we didn't

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:30.250
talk about the communication
aspect that was in the paper,

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:38.720
about how the user is in
the loop of application,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.000
but also now, with
like social media,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.750
you're also communicating
things to other people.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.140
Yeah.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.570
And performance, did you
have something to add?

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.080
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
I have much more to add.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.675
But I just thought it was
really interesting, because I,

00:45:06.675 --> 00:45:09.330
or at least when I'm
designing, I think of my users

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.740
like in a vacuum, kind of.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.960
Or if it's a
multiplayer experience,

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.030
then I think of them
working together,

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.860
but I had never thought of
someone being performing,

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.420
as a user.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.880
And so I just thought
that was interesting,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.690
an interesting takeaway for
me and my design endeavors.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:28.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:34.410
I don't think it's just pointing
towards the importance of user

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:39.030
testing, but also trying to
challenge your own assumptions,

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.680
as you're having people
test your artifact.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.990
Again, the things we
create are our babies,

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:54.900
and we tend to sort of cradle
them a little hard sometimes,

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:59.160
and we don't want-- we
want people to get how

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.540
we intended them to be used.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.480
And then we might be
less open to seeing where

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.680
the users or the
participants actually

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.950
subvert our
intentions, but still

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.590
make interesting use
of the artifacts,

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.260
and that is something
that we could actually

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:24.615
benefit from, from allowing
and allowing ourselves to see.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.980
And I think just
one example was when

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:38.910
I was talking to game designers
here in Boston about designing

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.480
co-op games, and I was
making a case that they often

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.390
make a less interesting
experience for player 2

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:49.470
than for player 1, I had a
guy come up to me afterwards

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.110
saying, I've made co-op
games for 10 years

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:57.480
and never thought of myself as
anything other than player 1.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.100
So if you're making those
kinds of experiences,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.830
at least try out
the different roles

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.220
that you are
designing for, and not

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.220
make assumptions
that, well, the expert

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.590
or the highly-skilled
person is always

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.820
going to be in this
role, and that fits me,

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.690
so I'm always going
to try out that role.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.500
Because when you try out
the role of player 2,

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.480
you might find that it's much
less either fun or interesting

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:33.207
than you intended for it to
be, just as one brief example.

00:47:33.207 --> 00:47:35.040
AUDIENCE: I also found
it really interesting

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.660
how they connected performance
to social media platforms.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.215
Because that is an interactive
experience that isn't a game,

00:47:43.215 --> 00:47:46.320
but some people
think it's a game.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.468
How many likes do you have?

00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
can be gamed, for sure.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, or
like World of Warcraft,

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.960
where you create this alternate
persona, or you put on this,

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.680
you perform.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.300
You perform the role of knight
elf priest, or whatever,

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:06.300
or you perform the role of
a popular figure on Twitter

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:11.280
who talks about puppies,
and that sort of thing.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.250
And I hadn't thought of
it as performance before,

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.190
but it really
comes down to that.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.910
And depending on
how much community

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.840
aspect you have inside of
whatever you're developing,

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.660
it seems like there's more
of a performance aspect.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.830
There's a lot of opportunity
for designing your own role

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:41.310
or identity online than you
have in offline performance.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.560
I mean, we're still
performing a certain role

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.970
when we're at work versus
at home, and so on.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:52.200
But you have a lot more
variables to tweak, I think,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:52.740
online.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:56.410
And it's just something
that's inherently in you.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.740
It's not something that
we have any experience

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.700
from before this century.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:08.910
We just didn't have
massively multi experienced

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.370
virtual environments,
and now we do.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:16.020
So we're struggling a little
bit with how to design for them

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.050
and make sense of
them, but no one else

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.380
is going to do it for us.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:25.860
So you are the ones
to solve these issues.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.310
Congratulations.

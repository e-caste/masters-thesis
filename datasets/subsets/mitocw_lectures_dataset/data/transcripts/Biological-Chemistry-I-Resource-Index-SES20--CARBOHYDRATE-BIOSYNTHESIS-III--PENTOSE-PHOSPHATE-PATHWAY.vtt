JOHN ESSIGMANN: Hi,
I'm John Essigman.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.290
I'm one of the
instructors in 5.07.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.350
I teach with JoAnne
Stubbe and Bogdan Fedeles,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.410
you've probably seen in
earlier videos of this type.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.590
Today we're going to talk about
the pentose phosphate pathway.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.420
Professionally,
I'm a toxicologist.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.310
The pentose phosphate
pathway is one

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.310
that is very central to the
people who work in my field,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.720
specifically because the pentose
phosphate pathway provides us

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.180
with one of the reagents
that we need in order

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.520
to be able to combat
or counter the effects

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.140
of oxidative stress.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.380
Oxidative stress is involved
in many pathologies.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.290
One of the reasons that the
pentose phosphate pathway is

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.860
challenging to teach
is because it's

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.560
a pathway that interacts
very, very closely

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.050
with other pathways--
for example, glycolysis,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.840
the energy-generating
pathway in gluconeogenesis,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.820
a pathway by which,
in some organs,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.700
you're able to
synthesize glucose

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.370
from non-carbohydrate
precursors.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.640
The fact that these tend
to be so closely related

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.280
makes it difficult to
see the distinct features

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.390
of the pentose
phosphate pathway.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.712
So let me show you the
pentose phosphate pathway

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.670
and how it interacts with
these other pathways.

00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:35.890
First of all, let me
start with the roles

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.450
of the pentose
phosphate pathway.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.290
As I see it, there are three.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.120
The first is this is
the cell's principle

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.250
source of an NADPH, which
is our reductive cofactor.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.070
It's used for the
synthesis of such things

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.050
as lipids and other
carbohydrates, and so on.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.350
So this is how the
reducing equivalent,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.570
the source of electrons
that we use in order

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.750
to be able to synthesize
complex molecules.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.690
The second major role
of the pentose phosphate

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.889
pathway is that it's our
biosynthetic source of ribose.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.560
We have to make ribose
for things like ATP.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.510
We have to make it for
the nucleotides that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.130
are in our nucleic acids.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.750
This is where it comes from.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.130
What we're also going to see
is that when we eat foods

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.390
that contain ribose--

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.030
for example, ATP
and nucleotides--

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.700
this is how they enter the
mainstream of metabolism

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
so that we can utilize them
as raw material or energy

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.350
material.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.060
And the third thing
about the pathway

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.800
is that some of the
intermediates you'll

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.970
see in what we call this
carbon scrambling phase

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.960
are critical for the synthesis
of certain biomolecules.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.850
This is where the
aromatic residues

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.060
come from in our aromatic
amino acids, such as tyrosine.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.690
So the pentose phosphate
pathway is very important

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.390
because it provides us with
our reducing equivalents.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.600
It provides us with
a biosynthetic source

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.310
of ribose for nucleotides.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.230
And it provides us
with building blocks

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.910
for more complicated molecules.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.890
Because this pathway is
associated with biosynthesis,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.890
in terms of its providing
reducing equivalents, what

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.650
we'll find is that the
pathway is very highly

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
expressed in tissues
that make a lot of lipid.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.080
Lipid is our bioenergetically
most expensive

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.330
biosynthetic process.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.090
Requires a lot of NADPH.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.040
If the cell is dividing,
what it's going to do

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.480
is make membranes.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.180
And that's a lot of
lipid biosynthesis.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.760
This pathway, the pentose
phosphate pathway,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.010
not surprisingly,
is upregulated when

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.780
we have to make a
lot of membranes--

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.640
for example, in a
cell that's growing.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.600
And that means, for
example, that this could be

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.650
a target for anti-cancer drugs.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.810
In other words, if you
wanted to find a pathway

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.980
to block in order to stop the
provision of the resources,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.960
the reductive
resources for growth,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.060
this would be one that
would be looked at--

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.830
in fact, is being looked at
by the modern pharmaceutical

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.330
industry.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.960
Over here toward the
center of the top

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.320
panel is what's often considered
to be a little bit confusing,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.330
but it's really actually
quite straightforward,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.350
which is the fact that this
pathway can run in two modes.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.410
I said earlier that the
pentose phosphate pathway

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.290
is an offshoot of
other pathways, which

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.770
makes it a little bit difficult
for some people to understand.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.780
So in this line
right across here

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.120
that I'm just moving
across, that's

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.540
going from glucose to pyruvate
as we go left to right.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.550
And that's, of
course, glycolysis.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.620
If we went from
pyruvate to glucose--

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.280
that is, going from
right to left--

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.020
that's gluconeogenesis.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.380
So gluconeogenesis,
for example, might

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.720
be a situation in a diabetic.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.570
For example, I'm a diabetic,
and when I go to sleep at night,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.980
I'm not eating, and what my
liver is doing is it's saying,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.660
OK, you haven't
eaten for a while.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.740
Your blood sugar is dropping.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.370
And my gluconeogenesis
pathways start

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.730
to manufacturing-- in my
case, unfortunately, too much.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.590
From non-carbohydrate
precursors,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.110
they move the carbon
from right to left

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.280
and put out a lot of
glucose into my blood.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.800
That's one of the uses of
the gluconeogenic pathway.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.200
Similarly, if a
Doberman Pinscher,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.204
which has become commonly seen
in the 5.07 course so far,

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:34.870
starts to chase me
down the street, what

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.430
I'm going to want
to do is I'm going

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.040
to want to take and break
down my glucose as quickly

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.890
as possible to bring
it toward pyruvate

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.100
to get fast ATP that I can
use to power my muscles

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.510
to be able to run away.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.700
So that's the gluconeogenesis
and the glycolysis pathways.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.210
Now imagine that you've
got a railroad track

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.790
and that you've got a
side track off of it.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.210
And that's what the pentose
phosphate pathway is.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.560
It is a track that comes off of
glycolysis or gluconeogenesis,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.940
stuff happens, and then you
can re-enter the mainstream

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.530
of the train line.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.960
The interesting thing is
that you can basically

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.070
go in either direction at
certain parts of this pathway.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.870
What this really means is
we have common components

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.440
in both the pentose
phosphate pathway

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.547
and along this main line of
gluconeogenesis/glycolysis.

00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:33.380
And the common components
we're going to see

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.020
are, first, glucose 6-phosphate;
second, fructose 6-phosphate;

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.020
and third, glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate, or GAP.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.930
So these are the common
features of all three pathways.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.300
OK, so I'm going to give you a
little bit of an overview first

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.550
and show you how this
side track works.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.514
Now, the pathway can be run in
the oxidative mode exclusively.

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:03.930
And what we'll see
is-- and again,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.150
the details will come
in a few minutes--

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.730
that this glucose 6-phosphate
is going to be oxidized in order

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.330
to generate--

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.990
and oxidation, of
course, is when electrons

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.350
are removed from the substrate.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.990
And they're going to
be put into an NADP

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.560
to form NADPH, which is
our reductive cofactor.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.380
So this is an oxidative arm.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.892
Now, one of the consequences
of this oxidation

00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:32.600
is going to be-- we're
going to be losing

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.710
a carbon from the six-carbon
glucose 6-phosphate

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.340
and we're going to be forming
a pentose, specifically

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.510
ribulose 5-phosphate.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.260
It's going to be
easily interconverted

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.040
with other pentoses,
five-carbon sugars.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.320
And then I want you to
notice that from here on,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.510
everything is reversible
in the pathway.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.760
Loss of CO2 typically
is irreversible,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.480
so this first arm, the first
oxidative arm, is irreversible.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.020
So if we go from glucose
6-phosphate to pentoses,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.160
that's a one-way street.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.110
The pentoses, if we are in the
process, say, of cell division,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.180
these can be used
to make nucleotides.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.780
And this is how we make
pentoses for nucleic acids.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.020
If we don't need the
pentoses, then the carbon

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.990
from the pentoses will
continue along the pathway

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.140
and will go into this
complicated carbon-scrambling

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.770
network, which we see underlined
with a squiggly line over here

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.300
in the center.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.300
And the scrambling will
result in the pentoses being

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.109
restructured into fructose
6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde

00:08:34.109 --> 00:08:36.299
3-phosphate, so
the carbon can then

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.320
continue along the pathway.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.120
So I can imagine the
pathway going like this.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.300
A cell-- let's say it's in a
situation where it is growing

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.970
and it needs NADPH,
and it needs pentoses

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.590
for making nucleotides.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.040
So it takes and it gets up to
the glucose 6-phosphate step.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.920
And so rather than
progressing in glycolysis,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.670
it takes, as you'll
see, a right-hand turn.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.290
Make the NADPH
that's going to be

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.290
needed for making those
membranes of the new cell.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.850
Getting pentoses,
which are going

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.800
to convert into nucleotides.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.560
And if you don't use
all of the pentoses,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.150
then what you want to do is you
don't want any waste material,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.580
so you go through the
carbon-scrambling network,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.680
and the remainder
of the material

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.650
will go back as fructose
6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.180
3-phosphate.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.930
So that's what we'll call the
full pentose phosphate pathway,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:30.390
with the oxidative and
the non-oxidative portions

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.220
distinctly shown.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.090
Everything's oxidative up
to the pentoses generation,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.640
and then it's
non-oxidative from pentoses

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.870
through the fructose 6-phosphate
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.570
Now in the Case B
over here-- we call it

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.970
the purely non-oxidative mode.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.680
Let's say you're in a situation
where you're not growing,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.680
but you do need,
for example, ATP,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.900
and you need pentoses for that.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.390
That's where the
back door comes in.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.590
We're going to be taking,
in this case out of probably

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.840
gluconeogenesis--
remember, gluconeogenesis

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.390
is the flow of carbon from
right to left in this pathway.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.930
So it could be amino
acids and things

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.900
from the tricarboxylic
acid, or TCA cycle,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.750
are flowing carbon
in this direction.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.450
And it goes up into the
gluconeogenic pathway,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.140
and then the
molecule repositories

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.960
fill up for a glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate and fructose

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.280
6-phosphate.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.840
If I were to block
gluconeogenesis right here,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.620
then carbon would flow
in this direction,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.040
would go through the
backdoor of the pathway.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.550
The carbon-scrambling phase
would result ultimately

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.600
in pentoses.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.540
So this would be a
biosynthetic route to pentoses.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.270
Again, that's a situation in
which we do not need NADPH.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.610
Perhaps we just need pentoses.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.420
OK, so now let me
get into the details.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.180
In the center of this piece
of paper, what you'll see

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.270
is the stoichiometry
of the pathway.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.180
In most of 5.07 so
far, we have seen

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.570
that we work with a
single molecule of glucose

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.800
working its way to two molecules
of pyruvate, and so on.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.440
Here the tricarboxylic
geometry works out best,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.440
or it's easiest to
teach and to appreciate,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.810
if you start with three
molecules of glucose.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.710
And we'll see why
in a few minutes.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.020
So what we'll do is--

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.390
I'm going to do is take
three molecules of glucose

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.630
6-phosphate.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.210
Now looking up at
the top here-- so

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.400
this is glucose to
glucose 6-phosphate.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.510
This is the entry portion right
here, with glucose 6-phosphate,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.310
into the oxidative
arm of the pathway.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.860
So that's 18 carbons.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.260
3 times 6 is 18.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.900
We're going to lose three CO2s.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.690
That's going to leave
us 15 carbons left.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.970
And those 15 carbons are
going to be distributed

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.920
among two fructose 6-phosphates
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.290
So here's the
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.810
Here's the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.920
That's the overall
stoichiometry of the pathway.

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.740
So now what I'm
going to do is go

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.650
through the chemical
details of the pathway,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.760
down here at the bottom
and on the next page.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.180
We've got glucose going
to glucose 6-phosphate.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.610
And I draw three lines
there because I'll

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.610
say this glucose 6-phosphate
is the abbreviation that I

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.490
use for the structure
that's shown right here.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.200
So this is glucose
6-phosphate with

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.020
the proper stereochemistry.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.470
Now the hydroxyl
group on the glucose--

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.890
we don't really know what
its stereochemistry is,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:55.000
but we've got it up or
in beta in this drawing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.540
The first step is for
the enzyme glucose

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.800
6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, G6PDH,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.060
to attack the one carbon.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.510
The electrons go down to
make a keto functionality.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.770
We lose hydride from the one
carbon, which is used then

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.560
to reduce NADP to NADPH.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.990
So that's our first
oxidation step.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.230
I want you to notice that
this is a one-way arrow.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.800
Typically at the top of a
pathway-- and in this case,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.420
it's at the very top--

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.200
these are the steps that are
thermodynamically irreversible.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.620
These are also the steps
where you principally effect

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.420
regulation of the pathway.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.920
And as I said
earlier, we're going

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.890
to be running three molecules
of glucose 6-phosphate

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.380
through this step.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.770
The next molecule in
the pathway is this one.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.760
This is a lactone.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.480
A lactone is a cyclic ester.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.510
So this is an ester, and
you can see it's cyclic.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.990
The next step involves
the addition of water

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.610
by lactonase in order to open
up this six-membered ring

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.970
to give you this linear
structure that we'll see here.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:13.770
And this is basically
6-phosphoglucuronic acid.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.950
The next step will
involve the oxidation

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.020
of the 1, 2, 3 carbon.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.160
I always try to find
places in any pathway

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.380
where we've seen the
same chemistry before

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.250
but with different molecules.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.400
This step right
here, specifically

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.250
working with lactonase and
the enzyme 6 phosphogluconate

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.580
dehydrogenase--

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.030
I'd like you to look back at
the tricarboxylic acid cycle,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.220
specifically at the enzyme
isocitrate dehydrogenase.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.880
While some of the specifics
are different, basically what

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.130
you'll see is the
overall concept

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.110
is the same for what's happening
in the next couple of steps.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.320
So let me now get
back to the drawing.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.370
So what we have
here is the 1, 2,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.780
3 carbon is vulnerable to what's
going to be an oxidation event.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.940
So a base will
remove the hydrogen

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.150
from the 3-hydroxyl group.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.140
The electrons that were holding
the hydrogen to the oxygen

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.510
will now move down to the
position between the oxygen

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.200
and the 3 carbon.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.490
And then the hydride
on the 3 carbon

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.060
will be transferred
to NADP to make NADPH.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.840
So this is the second
of two oxidation steps.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.960
That gives us this ring
open structure here.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.440
And just as happens in the
isocitrate dehydrogenase

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.430
step, what we've done is we've
generated a beta ketoacid.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.740
Whenever you see
a beta ketoacid,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.590
you really always want
to think that that's

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.520
prone to either enzymatic or
spontaneous decarboxylation.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.000
What you can see is the
electrons can go like this

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and like this and
like this, and that

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.600
will result in the cleavage
of the bond connecting

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.640
carbon 1 and carbon 2.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.570
So now the new
carbon 1 will be the

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.940
what was carbon 2, which
is the carbon that has

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.490
this little purple ball on it.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.090
And we're going to lose the
terminal, or 1 carbon, as CO2.

00:16:18.252 --> 00:16:21.630
The CO2 will have the triangle,
which up until this point

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.710
has defined our 1 carbon.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.140
Now I just want to mention
a couple of things.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.720
One is that we'll look at--

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.400
I put on-- like
here's a dark ball.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.120
Here's a purple ball, and
here's a black triangle.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.280
These could be-- for
example, experimentally,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.730
you could use a radioactive
chemical, a radioactive atom,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.600
in order to help you
trace the reaction as you

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.360
go from precursor to product.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.560
I'm using these just to help
you see the relationship

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.480
of a precursor and a product.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.660
And what we see here
is that the 1 carbon

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.140
is lost from the
beta ketoacid as CO2

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.390
and according to the kind
of chemistry that we've seen

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.030
many times for decarboxylation.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.890
Now, this is going to give
us a five-carbon product.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.710
We've lost the CO2.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.867
And that is ribulose
5-phosphate.

00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:14.950
And for this, I'm going
to go on to the next page.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.630
On the previous page,
we saw the loss of CO2

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.780
from the 1 carbon of
the beta ketoacid.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.800
And this gives us this linear
structure, five-carbon ribulose

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.570
5-phosphate.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.100
I've drawn it this
way so you can see it

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.980
from the perspective of what
was a six-carbon molecule that's

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.420
lost one carbon.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.090
But the more formal
chemical way to draw this

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.880
would be as the linear
chain of five carbons

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.770
starting with the new 1
carbon, which is the alcohol,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.410
with a purple circle.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.540
The next carbon would
have the carbonyl group,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.850
which I'll use a blue box.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.650
And all the way
down to what is now

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.390
the five-carbon-- what was
originally the six-carbon--

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.500
which has the dark black dot.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.350
Now because we're processing
three molecules of hexose

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:23.250
and now pentose, where
we've got three molecules

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.190
of ribulose 5-phosphate,
and the two enzymes that

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.180
are going to process this are
ribulose 5-phosphate isomerase

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.280
and ribulose
5-phosphate epimerase.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.640
Now, just because of
the relative activities

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.790
of these enzymes, we're going
to see that about one-third

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.850
of the molecules will be
processed by the isomerase

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.330
and two-thirds will be
processed by the epimerase.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.330
Now, let me tell you a little
bit about what isomerization

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.150
is, versus epimerization.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.290
Bogdan and others have told
you about the importance

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:01.270
of enediol or diolate
intermediates in biochemistry.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.130
The section of the molecule
in the ribulose 5-phosphate

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.000
that I'm circling here,
if you just take and form

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.030
an enediolate here,
what you can do

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.110
is you can move the carbonyl
functionality from the 2 carbon

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.620
up to the 1 carbon.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.020
And that's what happens when
you convert ribulose 5-phosphate

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.060
into ribose 5-phosphate.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.770
So it's a simple
enediol conversion.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.240
Very similarly, I could
have made the enediol

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.610
between the 2 and the 3 carbon.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.450
And if I did that,
I'll form an enediol.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.530
And depending on how
I put the hydrogen

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.360
back on that I take off, I
can change the stereochemistry

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.560
at the 3 carbon.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.040
In other words, I can form
the epimer at the 3 carbon.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.240
So I can go from this
epimer on the top

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.600
to where the hydroxyl group
is pointed to the right,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.450
to this epimer on the bottom,
where the hydroxyl group is

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.890
pointed to the left.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.270
This molecule, the epimer of
ribulose 5-phosphate, where

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.700
the hydroxyl on 3 is
pointed to the left,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.340
is called xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.750
As I said, this enzyme,
this epimerase enzyme,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.260
is a little more active
than the isomerase enzyme.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.070
So we get about two molecules
of the xylulose 5-phosphate

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.810
for every molecule
that we process--

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.330
again, by enediolate-type
intermediates

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.640
to form the ribose 5-phosphate.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.900
So this gives us a--

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.910
ribulose 5-phosphate
is now converted

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.720
into one molecule of
ribose 5-phosphate and two

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.199
molecules of
xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.210
I'm going to give you a little
bit of a mechanistic interlude

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.840
here to remind you that
some of the chemistry I'm

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.330
going to be showing you with
the enzyme transketolase

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.090
is very reminiscent
of chemistry we

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.150
have seen several times
in 5.07, specifically

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.060
the enzymes pyruvate
dehydrogenase,

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.530
pyruvate decarboxylase,
and alpha-ketoglutarate

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.060
dehydrogenase.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.130
Now, the molecule
that I have right here

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.560
in this little
mechanistic interlude box

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.660
is one of the ones we
were just talking about.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.960
Specifically, this is
xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.430
You see the epimer with the
3-hydroxyl off on the left.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.990
This carbonyl group is
exactly the type of carbonyl

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.550
that's attackable by
thiamine pyrophosphate, TPP.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.590
Let me remind you a
little bit about why

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.750
TPP can be a nucleophile to
attack this carbonyl group.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.300
TPP, when you look at
the whole cofactor,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.210
it has attached up
here an aminopyridine.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.130
And the amino group can
be in the imino tautomer,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.040
and that imino tautomer can
help pull off this hydrogen,

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.540
lowering the PK.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.670
So the PK of this is
actually something

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.610
in the order of
18 or 19, which is

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.660
sufficient to make this
carbon a good nucleophile

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.060
to be able to attack
the carbonyl that's

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.330
on our, in this case,
xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.320
That attack will result in the
formation of an initial adduct

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.460
in which the vitamin, the
TPP, is covalently associated

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.580
with the xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.210
You can see that the keto
group has been converted

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.080
into a hydroxyl group.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.390
So we've now got a dihydroxy
molecule at this point.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.540
And just as we've seen with
the other enzymes I mentioned

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.410
earlier-- for example, the
pyruvate dehydrogenase--

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.160
the delocalization of
electrons through this system

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.470
makes it possible
to be able to remove

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.740
this hydrogen. These electrons
move to this position.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.660
These electrons move up here.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.810
And that means that the bond
connecting the bottom three

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:01.420
carbons of the xylulose
5-phosphate is broken,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.070
and that gives you--

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.060
if you look at the chemistry--

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.290
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
the very common biochemical

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.460
intermediate.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.790
And what's left over
is the vitamin TPP

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.120
attached to two-carbon unit.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.980
And it's called
dihydroxyethyl TPP.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.420
Hydroxy, hydroxy, this
is an ethyl group,

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.860
and it's an anion,
the TPP anion.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.450
So I abbreviate that minus,
and then with a box, C2-TPP.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.590
It's a chemically reactive
nucleophilic intermediate

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.537
that we're going to be able to
use to do powerful chemistry.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.200
The enzyme
transketolase, which I'm

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.970
going to talk about
from the standpoint

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.000
of medical importance
somewhat later,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.410
enables the removal of
the top two carbons,

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.960
via the chemistry
I just showed you.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.030
It's a kind of a
chemical decapitation

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:05.900
to remove the C2-TPP in order
to liberate it to be able to be

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.110
used as a chemical reagent.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.940
So both of our molecules of
xylulose 5-phosphate are going

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.330
to be susceptible
to this chemistry,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.820
and that means we're going
to get two molecules of this

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.280
C2-TPP anion--

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.990
one here and one here--

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.790
and two molecules
of glyceraldehyde

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.370
3-phosphate-- here and here.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.360
OK?

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.680
What are we going to
do with the C2-TPP?

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.760
Well, I want to draw your
attention back up here

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.600
to the ribulose 5-phosphate.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.130
Remember, I told you
that it's possible,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.980
by way of an enediolate
intermediate,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.440
with this isomerase
enzyme, to move

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.470
the carbonyl group from the
2 carbon up to the 1 carbon.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.410
And that produces
ribose 5-phosphate.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.720
One of the things that I
just want to point out here

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.870
is ribose 5-phosphate was
one of the things that's one

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.080
of the goals of the pathway.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.540
So I could, for example, stop
the pathway here and shunt off

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.830
this ribose 5-phosphate to
be able to make nucleotides.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:12.710
But this carbonyl is exactly
the kind of functional group

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.470
that the C2-TPP looks for,
for chemical reaction.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.360
So I can plug in,
just like a LEGO,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.660
the C2-TPP on the five-carbon
ribose 5-phosphate.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.460
What that does is gives me--

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.330
5 plus 2 is 7--

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.900
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.340
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.480
Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.560
And just because of the
way the chemistry works,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.100
we've basically pushed out the
hydroxyl group at this position

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.790
off on the left, on
the number 3 carbon.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.230
OK, so now we have a
seven-carbon molecule.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.530
And again, this is another
biosynthetic opportunity.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.530
As I said earlier,
ribose 5-phosphate

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.180
can go off to make
ribonucleotides.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.900
If you look up the
pathway of synthesis

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.960
of the aromatic amino acid
tyrosine, what you'll see

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:12.710
is that basically this is the
biosynthetic intermediate that

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.860
will go off to produce
that aromatic amino acid.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.140
OK, so this is
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:27.150
Now if I look at the
top three carbons here,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:32.930
you've got basically an alcohol,
a carbonyl, and an alcohol.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:38.600
This looks almost identical
to the carbon 1, 2, and 3

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.030
that you see in the aldolase
reaction back in glycolysis.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.850
In other words, the
linear form of--

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.920
in that case, it's
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate--

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.060
in the linear form looks
very much like this.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.050
And what that means is
that the aldolase enzyme,

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.690
with its amino group
at its active site,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.680
can attack this
carbonyl group to form

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.130
a protonated imine that will--

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.660
in the process of
the chemistry, you

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.550
can break the bond
that connects carbon

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.200
3 to carbon 4 of this molecule.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.790
So the enzyme transaldolase
that does this chemistry

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.820
is very similar to
the aldolase enzyme

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.890
that we have looked at in
the glycolysis pathway.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.920
This is the splitting,
in this case,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.250
of a seven-carbon compound
into a three-carbon

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.800
and a four-carbon, whereas
in the case of glycolysis,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.730
it was splitting a
six-carbon compound into two

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.560
three-carbon compounds.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.595
This intermediate that I'm
encircling here with the imine

00:27:45.595 --> 00:27:49.730
is very similar to the
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:50.710
precursor.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.880
So I'll call it a
DHA-like fragment--

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.340
two methanol groups with a
methyl imine in the middle.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.230
So what we've done is
I've taken the top three

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.840
carbons of the
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.530
and made it into something
that looks a lot like carbons

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:18.320
1, 2, and 3 from the aldolase
step of the glycolysis pathway.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.340
So it's a dihydroxyacetone-like
phosphate.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.220
I'm just going to put that
off to the side for a minute.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.210
The bottom four carbons,
carbons 4, 5, 6, and 7

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.130
of the sedoheptulose
7-phosphate,

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.490
are something we haven't
actually seen in 5.07 before.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.560
But if we look at
what the structure is,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.240
it's going to be an aldehyde--

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.220
one, two, three,
four-carbon aldehyde.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.090
And this is erythrose
4-phosphate, E4P.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.570
Now, that in itself is
not a valuable molecule.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.570
But it turns out
that we can make it

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.510
into a valuable
molecule very easily.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.340
Remember back when
we were talking

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:59.620
about this C2-TPP
electrophilic molecule that

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.350
can put two carbons
onto anything that

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.320
has an aldehyde at the end?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.430
Well, erythrose 4-phosphate
has an aldehyde at the end.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.270
If we do the chemistry and
we plug this C2 fragment

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.500
onto the erythrose 4-phosphate
fragment up at the aldehyde,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.580
you get a six-carbon compound
that is fructose 6-phosphate.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.580
So this is the source
of fructose 6-phosphate

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.660
that can then become part of the
gluconeogenesis or glycolysis

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.440
pathways.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.790
So we haven't wasted anything.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.544
We've taken a kind
of a trash molecule,

00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:34.960
the erythrose
4-phosphate, that we

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.814
don't have a lot
of other uses for,

00:29:36.814 --> 00:29:38.230
and we've converted
into something

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.260
that we can use for energy
production, just as an example.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.900
Now what I'd like to
do is come back up

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.080
to this dihydroxyacetone-like
fragment

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.350
that I talked about
a little bit ago.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:55.340
In the glycolysis pathway, we
start with the hexose glucose,

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.340
and eventually, after
about four or five steps,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.710
we get to another hexose,
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:06.660
Then the aldolase step takes
and splits that in half

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.380
into, on the one hand, a
dihydroxyacetone-like fragment

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.350
and, on the other hand, a
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.460
fragment.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.550
And the dihydroxyacetone-like
fragment

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.420
is covalently connected by
way of its middle carbon,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.940
the carbonyl, to
the enzyme aldolase.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.300
When we look at what's happening
in the transaldolase reaction,

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.710
it's really the same thing.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.290
We've taken the seven-carbon
molecule, in this case,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.650
and we've split off this
three-carbon intermediate.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.010
Again, it's chemically just
about identical to what

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.060
happened in glycolysis,
when we pulled apart

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.310
the six-carbon
sugar and we've now

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.490
got this thing on the right
which we can do something with.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.930
The dihydroxyacetone phosphate
is covalently connected

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.980
to the enzyme transaldolase.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.840
It's a transaldolase.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.900
It can do the aldolase
reaction, the splitting,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.080
but then it can take and it
can transfer very easily.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.120
What are we going
to transfer it to?

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.360
Well the dihydroxyacetone
phosphate chemically

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.190
can be transferred very easily
to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:21.210
So I'm going to find
a way now to connect

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.700
this dihydroxyacetone-like
fragment

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.130
to a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.410
And I find one right here.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.980
Let me go back a little bit
and see where it came from.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.250
I had the xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.810
I knocked off the
top two carbons.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.430
I used those in order to make
the sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.650
My residue was the
three-carbon molecule

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.020
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.320
But again, this could be a
waste product, but instead

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.080
of using it as a waste
product, what I can do

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.920
is to take the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate that

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.960
is a waste product of the
transketolase reaction

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.410
down here, and I can
utilize it by combination

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.470
with the dihydroxyacetone
phosphate from up here,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.630
the transaldolase reaction.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.090
Transaldolase has
the transfer ability

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.300
to bring these molecules
together covalently, plug them

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.010
together, 3 and 3, to make 6.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.850
And that's your second molecule
of fructose 6-phosphate.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.730
While I've still got this sheet
with the whole pathway on it,

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.460
I'm going to give you a
little bit of a summary.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.460
I took three molecules
of glucose 6-phosphate,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.930
oxidized it twice, generated
two molecules for each molecule

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.480
of glucose 6-phosphate.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.620
I got two molecules of NADPH,
the reducing equivalents.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.280
The pathway up to that point
created a beta ketoacid.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.770
Therefore there was this
decarboxylation event.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.780
So what I ended up with is
three five-carbon molecules,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.680
ribulose 5-phosphate.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.870
The ribulose
5-phosphate, depending

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.180
upon the balance of activities
of the next two enzymes,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.420
will partition at
about a 2-to-1 ratio

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:18.540
into xylulose 5-phosphate
and ribose 5-phosphate.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.680
Then I explained how the
xylulose 5-phosphate had

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.780
this carbonyl at
the second position,

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.350
and that looked
like the carbonyl

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.170
in a lot of other
biochemical reactions

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.270
we've seen earlier in 5.07.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.930
And it's vulnerable to attack
by the ylid carbanion of TPP,

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.100
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.950
Applying that
transketolase enzyme

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.900
to xylulose 5-phosphate
split off the top two carbons

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:52.730
as this electrophilic chemical
reagent that I call C2-TPP.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.670
The bottom three carbons became
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.840
The C2-TPP got added onto
ribose 5-phosphate, which

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.570
is one of the molecules that was
made from the early-on ribulose

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.830
5-phosphate.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.690
That made the
seven-carbon molecule

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.520
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.265
And again, I said that that's
a precursor to other things,

00:34:15.265 --> 00:34:18.889
like aromatic amino
acids, if you need them.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.610
The sedoheptulose
7-phosphate, however,

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.460
has a structure that makes
it amenable to having

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.389
its top three carbons taken
off by an aldolase-like enzyme,

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.980
transaldolase.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.139
What makes this
aldolase special is it

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:38.989
will take the three carbons
off as a protein three-carbon

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.440
adduct and allow
that three carbons

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.429
to be added onto one of the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.989
that was generated in the
transketolase reaction.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.949
3 plus 3 is 6, and that becomes
your fructose 6-phosphate.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:03.410
Overall, what happens is you put
in three glucose 6-phosphates,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.470
you lose some CO2s,
and you produce

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.450
two fructose
6-phosphates and one

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.770
leftover glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.400
And these are in the
mainstream of glycolysis

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.180
and gluconeogenesis.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.740
So that's the details
of the pathway.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.230
We start with a
six-carbon compound,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.380
three molecules of
it, and we generate

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.630
three molecules of CO2.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.420
We're going to generate
six molecules of NADPH.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.790
And at the beginning of the
page that we're looking at here,

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.160
we have three molecules
of a five-carbon compound,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.630
this ribulose 5-phosphate.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.260
And again, at this point,
the carbon-scrambling phase

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.010
takes over.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.570
And at the end, we
end up with taking

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:54.230
the 15 carbons of the three 5
carbon ribulose 5-phosphates,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:58.380
and scrambling them into
two six-carbon fructose

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.040
6-phosphates and one
three-carbon glyceraldehyde

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.820
3-phosphate.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.570
We've now looked at
the pentose phosphate

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.590
pathway from two levels.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:16.010
Let's say initially, what I see
right here is the pathway from,

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.380
let's say, the
10,000-foot level.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.850
We see there's the mainstream
of metabolism of glucose

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.910
to pyruvate--

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.650
that's glycolysis-- or pyruvate
to glucose, gluconeogenesis.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.850
And we have seen how in the
pentose phosphate pathway,

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.730
we go from glucose
6-phosphate, we

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.610
do some oxidation-- that's
why you get the NADPH.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.140
You lose some CO2.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.630
You get the pentoses.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:44.870
I've introduced you to ribose,
ribulose, and xylulose.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.440
Then in order to get
these pentoses back

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.420
into mainstream
metabolism, we do

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.170
this complicated
carbon-scrambling routine,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:58.820
and then get back to fructose
6-phosphate and GAP to be

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.510
able to continue in
mainstream metabolism.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.130
Nothing is wasted.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.140
There's the 10,000-foot level.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.090
And then I went, down
here at the bottom,

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.420
to sort of the 2-foot level,
all the little details

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.740
of the chemistry.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:17.040
So I've taught you this, the
pentose phosphate pathway,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.820
in the beginning at
the 10,000-foot level,

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.670
and then got you down to
the 2-foot level with all

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.980
of the details of the
chemical mechanisms.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.060
And our course,
Biological Chemistry 5.07,

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.150
is a chemistry course, so
that's very appropriate.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.260
But 5.07 is also 25.07.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.420
20 is the Biological
Engineering department.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.010
And the engineers actually
think a lot about, let's say,

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.770
mathematical equations more
than chemical equations.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.810
And they think about
schematics, written out

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.510
like you'd look at an
electrical schematic.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.900
So because the Biological
Chemistry group

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.630
we have is quite large,
we have kind of an ending

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:02.330
to this pathway that appeals, I
think, to more the engineering

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.200
mindset.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.440
So for the engineers, I'm going
to move from the two-foot level

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.840
up to about the 100-foot level.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.350
And I'm going to present
it as a schematic.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.520
The shorthand that I use
involves these little boxes.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.560
Each of these is a molecule.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.870
And the abbreviation
is in the top--

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.780
G6P, glucose 6-phosphate.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.840
It has six carbons.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.620
That'll help me keep track of
how many carbons are there.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.120
And there are three
molecules of it.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.200
So we've got 6 times 3, or 18
carbons, that we start with.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.180
In the oxidative phase,
we've seen that each molecule

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.350
gives rise to two NADPHs.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.420
2 times 3 is 6.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.335
So we've got 6 NADPHs.

00:38:46.335 --> 00:38:48.710
There are three molecules that
are starting, and remember

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:52.060
that beta ketoacid
that's formed?

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.700
We have three of those, and
they're going to carboxylate.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.290
So I get rid of three CO2s.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:02.000
So the broken line
indicates the boundary

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.870
between the irreversible
and the reversible parts

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.680
of the reaction.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.220
This gives us
ribulose 5-phosphate.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.552
That's our initial product
entering the pathway.

00:39:13.552 --> 00:39:15.800
It's a five-carbon molecule.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.820
There are three molecules
of it, total of 15 carbons.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.940
Depending upon the activities
of the epimerase in the bottom--

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.510
E-- or the isomerase--

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:32.050
I-- on the top, you either
get more or less of the X5P,

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:36.440
xylulose 5-phosphate, or
ribose 5-phosphate, R5P.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.000
And as I said,
typically the epimerase

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.630
wins out by about 2-to-1
over the isomerase.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.710
So we've got a
simple isomerization

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:53.540
to take the ribulose 5-phosphate
to ribose 5-phosphate.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.560
It's a C5 molecule.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.730
You get one of those.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.990
So we've got five of
our carbons over here.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.150
If we look at the
epimerase reactions,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.980
we get two boxes,
one for each molecule

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.690
of xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.220
Each of them are C51.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.440
So those are our two molecules.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.270
Now let's take our first
molecule of xylulose

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.970
5-phosphate, the one
in the top X5P box.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.675
And again, keep in mind
that these arrowheads

00:40:23.675 --> 00:40:25.040
are going both ways.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.070
Because the carbon can flow
both ways in these reactions.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.290
These are equilibrium reactions.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:36.310
We can take the top two
carbons off of the X5P.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.030
This is the thiamine
pyrophosphate reaction.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.150
And what that does is it gives
us that chemically reactive

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.340
C2-TPP fragment.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.920
Carbon 2, two
carbons, one of those.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.520
OK?

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.240
And the bottom half is
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate--

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.440
a three-carbon
molecule, one of those.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.160
The ribose 5-phosphate,
the five-carbon aldehyde,

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:08.320
can have the C2-TPP
add to it's one carbon.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.700
2 carbons plus 5 carbons give 7.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.580
Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
is the product--

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.560
one molecule of those.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.270
Transaldolase can split
off the top three carbons

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:24.690
to make that
dihydroacetone-like fragment.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.670
This is the one
that's covalently

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:33.080
attached by this imine-like
bond to the triose sugar.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.690
Three-carbon sugar--
one molecule of that.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.190
And after you do this
transaldolase reaction

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.120
and you've taken off
the top three carbons,

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.770
you've got a residue
of four carbons.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:49.980
So that's the erythrose
4-phosphate, C4, one molecule.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.350
Now, the transaldolase
reaction can do a transfer.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:58.450
So you'll take this DHA,
dihydroxyacetone-like fragment,

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.770
and combine it with
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.300
that it got from the molecule
1 of xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.980
So we can follow the schematic.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.190
Xylulose 5-phosphate gives
us this gap molecule,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.020
glyceraldehyde 3phosphate.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.740
It can combine
with the molecule,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:22.120
the DHA-like fragment, to
form for our first molecule

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.310
of fructose 6-phosphate,
which will then

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.820
go off into glycolysis
or gluconeogenesis.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.050
Now, the residue of this was
this erythrose 4-phosphate

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:32.830
product.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.230
What can we do with it?

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.300
For again, this is an aldehyde.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.520
It can react with a C2
fragment from the C2-TPP.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.690
So where we get that C2-TPP
is from our second molecule

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.700
of xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.990
Transketolase takes
off the top two carbons

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.140
and plunks it onto the
erythrose 4-phosphate to form

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.550
our second molecule of two
of fructose 6-phosphate.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.270
C6, one molecule.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.140
And what's left over
after all is said and done

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.470
is this fragment right here,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.640
C3 molecule, one molecule.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.510
So if I did this
correctly, we should

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.670
have 15 carbons over here--

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.560
6, 6, and 3--

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.820
and we do.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.915
So these are the molecules
that will flow into glycolysis

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:24.280
or gluconeogenesis.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:30.010
Now because most of these
arrows are double-headed,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.560
you can also imagine
that fructose

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.800
6-phosphate and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.140
in the mainstream metabolism, in
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:47.810
can backflow right to left and
end up with these pentoses.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.190
So for example, if I wanted
to make ribose 5-phosphate

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.250
in order to make
ATP, and I didn't

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.410
need any reducing
equivalents, all I

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.340
would do is run all of this in
reverse, get up to this point,

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.830
ribose 5-phosphate,
and then take this off

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.630
to make nucleotides.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.250
On the other hand,
if I'd like to make

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:13.010
just NADPH for biosynthesis,
what I would do

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.330
is the following.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.820
I'd start with my
glucose-6 phosphate.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:22.670
Early on, yield my 6 NADPHs.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.050
Go from left to right
across the pathway,

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:30.680
all the way to produce
fructose 6-phosphate and GAP.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.950
And then what I'd do is I'd
use gluconeogenesis in order

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:38.670
to convert fructose
6-phosphate and GAP back

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.870
into glucose 6-phosphate that
then would be able to re-enter

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.670
the pathway once again.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.410
Now, what I want to
do is to show you

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.790
that, I want to go back to the
original drawing that I had,

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.560
to show you how that would work.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.050
So what I just said was that
if I were in a situation

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.200
where all I wanted was NADPH,
I could do the following.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.360
I could enter the carbon
from glucose 6-phosphate,

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.130
make the pentoses, get my
NADPH, and then take the carbon

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.490
and flush it back through
the scrambling phase

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.700
to produce fructose
6-phosphate and GAP.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.240
Now here's the
important part, is

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.410
I can now, through
gluconeogenesis,

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.020
move the carbon back up
to glucose 6-phosphate

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.530
and do it again, and
again, and again.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.300
In other words,
recursively, I can

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:36.060
metabolize all of the carbon
from glucose 6-phosphate.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.920
All six carbons can eventually
become converted into CO2

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.740
with copious amounts of NADPH.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.590
And that's part of the
power of this pathway.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.860
It's very versatile.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.980
You can use it to make
reducing equivalents.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.110
You can use it to make sugars.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.110
You can use it to make
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.610
to make aromatic amino acids.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.170
It's a very powerful pathway.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:08.330
The top part of this
picture shows us

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.574
the schematic of the pathway.

00:46:09.574 --> 00:46:11.240
And I think with the
schematic up there,

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.770
I think this is a good time
to make some summary comments.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.930
So one thing I mentioned
at the very beginning

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:23.150
is that we need NADPH in
order to finance biosynthesis

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.230
of lipids--

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:25.910
in particular for
making membranes.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.360
So these are needed for growth.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.890
So I think now you can see
why this pathway is turned

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:34.610
on in cells that are
making new tissue, that

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.470
are making new cells.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.390
If you run it in
the oxidative mode--

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.600
that's the one that
I just described,

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.970
where you purely use
it to make NADPH--

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:49.640
you can oxidize all the carbons
of your glucose 6-phosphate

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.900
into CO2.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.900
That's the scenario
that I just ran.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.930
I didn't emphasize enough
that if, for example, you

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.620
eat food that contains
nucleic acid, which of course

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.540
we all do, that nucleic
acid contains ribose.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.860
That ribose, we want to be
able to do something with.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.610
And what happens is it enters
right here into the pathway.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.750
In other words, if I
wanted to take that ribose

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.110
and if I wanted to
make energy out of it,

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.690
the ribose would go
from left to right,

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.630
and I would end up with
fructose 6-phosphate,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.820
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.500
And then I could use that,
putting it through glycolysis

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.380
and then the TCA
cycle to make energy.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.300
Point 4 is one that
I mentioned earlier.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.950
I'm a toxicologist,
and point 4 shows

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:41.180
how NADPH helps us defend
against oxidative stress.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.200
And I have this little
cartoon at the bottom.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:52.310
Free radicals are a
consequence of living

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.170
in an aerobic environment.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:48:01.310
We breathe oxygen. It can
be incompletely reduced

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:04.910
to produce things like
superoxide and hydrogen

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.420
peroxide and even
hydroxyl radical.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.700
These are chemically
very dangerous,

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.820
and they'll form peroxides
and other molecules that

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.970
can cause disease.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:21.260
So we have protective
systems based on a variety

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.360
of small molecules in the cell.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.750
One of them is
called glutathione.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.040
Millimolar concentrations
of glutathione

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.400
exist in our liver cells,
and they exist in order

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.150
to be able to do the
kind of chemistry I'm

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.890
going to show you right here.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.410
So a peroxide that
I'm pointing to,

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.470
ROOH, is dangerous
because it can give rise

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:43.400
to these free radicals
that can be damaging to us.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.570
What we can do is take
two molecules of this

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.980
sulfur-containing glutathione--
it's a tripeptide--

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:59.140
and they will give up their
H dot dot, their hydrides,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.930
in order to be able to basically
break this ROOH into ROH

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.830
and alcohol and HOH, water--

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:13.000
in other words, relatively
harmless products.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.570
Now, glutathione, the RSH--

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:20.650
sometimes called GSH--
sacrifices itself and becomes

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.235
this oxidized form, RSSR.

00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:26.110
Now, the reaction that
does this first part's

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.510
called glutathione peroxidase.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:34.810
In order to restore our cellular
stores of reduced glutathione,

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:39.820
RSH, we have to take
the oxidized form, RSSR,

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.230
and we have to reduce it.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.240
That's where the NADPH comes in.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.800
NADPH is the cofactor used
by glutathione reductase.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.320
And what it does is puts
in the reducing equivalents

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.400
to basically convert
oxidized glutathione back

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.640
to what we want, which is
the reduced glutathione, that

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.640
can then go on to protect
us against free radicals.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.580
NADPH has a very special
role in protecting any cell

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.380
from oxidative stress.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.570
It has a very special
role, however,

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.310
when you deal with
red blood cells.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.810
Red blood cells lack a nucleus.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.500
They lack a mitochondrion.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.090
They're pretty much
entirely cytosol.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.712
Cytosol has a
glycolysis pathway.

00:50:21.712 --> 00:50:23.170
That's where they
get their energy.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.222
And the pentose
phosphate pathway,

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:27.430
which is where they get the
reducing equivalents that

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.310
are necessary to help
maintain the red blood

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.350
cells' integrity-- if
you think about it,

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.540
you know, a red blood cell's
carrying a lot oxygen.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.619
Oxygen itself can
be very damaging.

00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:38.410
Red blood cells are
damaged, and you really

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.770
need to have these reducing
equivalents available in order

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.130
to maintain the structural
and functional integrity

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.550
of a red blood cell.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:52.810
So anything that disrupts the
NADPH pool in a red blood cell

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.760
ultimately causes
a kind of anemia,

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.850
because that means the red
blood cell can't persist

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.100
as long as it would otherwise.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.850
People who have defects in
NADPH metabolism-- for example,

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:10.690
a person who might have a defect
or a sluggish first enzyme

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:14.620
in the pathway, the glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase--

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.170
the red blood cells, because
of this NADPH problem,

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.330
don't last as long.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.850
Clinically, it's observed
that these people

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.130
have somewhat of a
resistance against diseases

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.310
such as malaria.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.320
That might be
because the red blood

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.620
cells don't last long
enough for the organism that

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.770
causes malaria,
Plasmodium falciparum,

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.200
to be able to complete
its life cycle.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.330
So sometimes a genetic defect
can actually provide an asset.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.350
And in some places in the
world where people have evolved

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.930
in the presence of the
malaria Plasmodium organism,

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.060
they have defects
in the pathway that

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.460
are maintained, from
generation to generation,

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.095
in order to be resistant
to the environment.

00:51:56.095 --> 00:51:57.720
The sixth point that
I want to bring up

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.110
with regard to this
pathway has to do

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.240
with the enzyme at the
top of the pathway,

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.909
once again, the glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

00:52:07.909 --> 00:52:09.450
I mentioned it at
the very beginning,

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:11.367
but I want to
reiterate that enzymes

00:52:11.367 --> 00:52:13.200
that are at the top of
a pathway where there

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.300
is thermodynamically
reversible steps,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:20.430
they are places where you have
the ability to control entry

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.340
into the pathway.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.480
So these are the
rate-determining steps.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.180
And in this case, the
presence of NAD+--

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.950
that is, the product--

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:35.250
determines the rate of
passage through the pathway.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.850
So for example, if a
cell has been doing a lot

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:43.320
of biosynthesis, the
NADP+ levels go up.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.152
That interacts
allosterically in order

00:52:47.152 --> 00:52:49.360
to be able to increase the
throughput of the pathway.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.350
So you increase
the amount of NADPH

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:55.680
biosynthesis to be
able to let it match

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.620
the biosynthetic needs
associated with doing

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.430
a lot of lipid biosynthesis.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:01.800
So this is the regulated step.

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.660
The last thing I'm going to
say about the pentose phosphate

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.760
pathway is that it's strikingly
similar to the pathway called

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.160
the Calvin cycle, which
are the dark reactions

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.380
of photosynthesis.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.460
Photosynthesis involves
the capture of one CO2

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:29.230
into a five-carbon scaffold
to make a six-carbon compound.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.390
Then that six-carbon
compounds splits

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.160
into three-carbon compounds.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.370
It turns out if you work
with enough molecules

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.190
of five-carbon compound,
what you're able to do

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:42.340
is go through the
carbon-scrambling phase

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.050
and work all your way back
to the hexose glucose.

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.040
The carbon-scrambling
intermediates

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.400
are almost identical
chemically to the ones

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.350
that we have just looked at in
the pentose phosphate pathway.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.410
So if you look at
the Calvin cycle,

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:00.130
you'll see three-carbon and
four-carbon and five-carbon and

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:03.920
six-carbon and even seven-carbon
intermediates, identical.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.570
So nature, again, didn't
reinvent the wheel twice.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.490
What it did was at
some point in time,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:11.750
it took the pentose
phosphate pathway

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.950
and it converted it into the
photosynthetic dark reactions,

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:17.612
or perhaps vice versa.

00:54:17.612 --> 00:54:18.820
They have different purposes.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.230
The photosynthetic pathway
involves capturing carbon

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.630
in order to make
hexoses that we can

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:29.470
use to store for energy,
future energy use,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.080
or to make hexoses you
could use to make cellulose,

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.150
if you're a plant.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.040
On the other hand,
the pentose phosphate

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.720
pathway-- again,
the same chemistry.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.300
But in this case,
the chemistry is all

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.710
aimed at taking the hexose,
the six-carbon compound,

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:46.750
and using it to make
reducing equivalents

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.400
that we can use
for biosynthesis,

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.580
or to protect us from
oxidative stress,

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.520
or to make riboses that we need
when we're growing, in order

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.130
to be able to make nucleic
acids, nucleotides, ATP,

00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.200
and so on, that we need.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.109
The pentose phosphate
pathway may seem a little bit

00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.900
difficult to learn.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.940
But I think it's
very worthwhile.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:17.530
It is something that provides
us with amazing versatility.

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:20.800
It gives us compounds
that are chemically

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.800
reactive at the level of two
carbons, three carbons, four

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.460
carbons, five carbons, six
carbons, and seven carbons.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.990
You can take these
pieces and you

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:32.200
can make a wide array of
molecules that are absolutely

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.060
essential for life.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.450
Moreover, it provides us
with reducing equivalents,

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.830
which we need to grow--

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.200
biosynthesis.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.090
Moreover, those reducing
equivalents also

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.580
help protect us from
oxidative stress.

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.700
That helps keep us alive
and healthy longer.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:53.290
So the pentose phosphate
pathway is complicated

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:55.700
because it does so
many different things.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.300
But any one of those
things, I think, in itself

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.840
makes it worthwhile learning all
of this complicated chemistry.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.020
So that's the pentose phosphate
pathway from the 10,000-foot

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.600
level down to the 2-foot level.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.880
Incredibly versatile
pathway, and I

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.770
hope that this has
helped you understand it.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.220
Thank you very much.

SCOTT HUGHES: I'm going to
record two lectures today.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.970
These are the final two lectures
I will be recording for 8.962.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.170
I actually have notes on
an additional two lectures.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.600
I have notes for an
additional two lectures.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.540
But those additional
two lectures

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.180
are somewhat advanced material.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.200
It's sort of fun to go over them
in the last week of the course,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.130
for certain students.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.720
It can be a great
introduction to some

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.180
of the most important
topics in modern research.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.788
But I am not going
to come into campus

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.080
and present those lectures,
OK, given everything that's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.760
going on right now.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.250
To be blunt, they are
kind of bonus material.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.480
And this isn't the time.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290
This is not the semester for
us to go through our bonuses.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.570
I will make those
notes available.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.620
I will be happy to discuss
them in a saner moment

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.150
with any student who
is interested in them.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.100
But this semester, let's just
focus on the core material.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.150
So that brings us to the topic
of what we are studying today.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.490
Pardon me while I
correct my handwriting.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.640
So if I can do a recap of
what we discussed last time,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
we took a look at a spacetime
that has this Schwarzschild

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.420
solution written in
the Schwarzschild

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080
coordinates everywhere.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.000
In our previous
lecture, we looked

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.830
at a spacetime that described
a fluid body, a spherically

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.900
symmetric fluid body.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.230
And it had a surface.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.990
This was the solution that
we used for its exterior.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.840
This ends up describing
a solution that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.580
has zero stress energy tensor.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.320
So it describes a
vacuum situation.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.820
OK?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.370
So if I imagine a spacetime
that looks like this everywhere,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.000
well, what I end up finding is
that this is a vacuum solution.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
It has T-mu-nu
equals 0 everywhere.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.820
However, it also has a mass m.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.710
So this is the vacuum
solution with mass,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
which is, well, that's weird.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.880
We examined some of its
curvature properties,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.650
and we found that at r equals
0, there is a tidal singularity,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.220
OK, in invariant
quantity that we

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.910
constructed from the tidal
tensors, blows up at r

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.040
equals 0.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.690
R equals 2GM looks
a little bit funny.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.920
And it turns out tides
are well behaved there.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.687
OK, there's nothing pathological
in the spacetime there.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.270
But there is a
coordinate singularity.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.700
Our coordinate t
is behaving oddly.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.290
And where we left
things last time

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.850
is I did a little
diagnosis of this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.070
by imagining a body that
falls into spacetime

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.663
from some starting radius R0.

00:02:49.663 --> 00:02:51.330
And I looked at the
motion of this thing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.310
as a function of time.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.700
What we find is that if we look
at the motion of this thing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.090
as a function of the proper
time of that in-falling body,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.500
it crosses 2GM in
finite proper time.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.530
And shortly afterwards,
again, in finite proper time,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.590
it reaches the r equals
0 tidal singularity.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.565
If I look at that same
motion as a function

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:17.300
of the coordinate
time t, it never

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.620
even reaches, never even
reaches r equals 2GM.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.180
We found a solution,
what you can

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.010
see in notes that
I've put online

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.263
and that are presented
in the previous lecture.

00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:30.930
But we found a solution
in which it just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.350
asymptotically
approaches r equals 2GM,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.210
only reaching that radius in
the t goes to infinity limit.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.720
These are two starkly
different pictures

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.790
of the kinematics of
this in-falling body.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.120
So the question is,
what is going on here?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.260
And as food for
thought, I reminded us

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.710
that these coordinates, if
we sort of look at the way

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.860
that spacetime behaves for
a very, very, very large M--

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.960
Excuse me, very,
very, very large R,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.220
not M, but for a very large R,
R much, much greater than 2GM,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.830
this turns into the line
element of flat spacetime.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.530
Flat spacetime is what we
use in special relativity.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.240
And our time
coordinate there, it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.110
is designed using this
Einstein synchronization

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.279
procedure, which means that
the properties of light

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.350
as it propagates
through spacetime

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.740
are built into the
coordinate system.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.218
So that suggests
what we might want

00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:25.760
to start doing in order to try
to get some insight as to what

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.260
is going on with this
weird spacetime is

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.770
to think about light as it
propagates into spacetime.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.134
Let's think about what happens
to radiation as it propagates.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:53.480
So let's imagine as the body
falls that it emits a radio

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:16.630
pulse with a
frequency as measured

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.070
according to the in falling.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.445
Let's say there's
an observer who

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.820
is falling in who's got a
little radio transmitter that's

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.010
beaming this message out.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.820
And according to that observer,
this thing is emitted,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.880
the pulse has a
frequency omega--

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.440
very far away, we can
describe the momentum

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.680
of this radio pulse like so.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.440
Imagine the thing is propagating
out radially and very,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.510
very far away where the
spacetime is approximately

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.680
flat.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.920
It's simply the
four-momentum that

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.180
describes a null geodesic moving
in the radial direction, OK?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.000
Minus sign here because with the
index in the upstairs position

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.190
and this asymptotically
flat region,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.030
that would be the energy.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.480
So a couple of facts
to bear in mind.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:38.820
The energy measured by an
observer with four-velocity

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:48.090
U is given by, let's call it
E sub U, the energy measured

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:57.420
by observer U. This
is minus P-dot-U.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.372
We developed this in
special relativity.

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:04.830
But remember the way that we
use the equivalence principle.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.955
We're gonna use the Einstein
equivalence principle.

00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:10.470
And any law that holds in a
freely falling frame, if I

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.570
can write it in a
tensorial way that

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.300
works in that freely falling
frame, it works in any frame.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.820
So this tensorial
statement holds true,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.850
even though we are now
working in the spacetime that

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.640
is distinctly different
from special relativity.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:40.850
We also know that in a
time independent spacetime,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.470
the downstairs T component
of four momentum is constant.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:01.130
So what this basically means
is if I think about this radio

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.290
pulse with its light
propagating out

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.270
through the spacetime, the value
P0 associated with this thing's

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.220
four momentum, it's
the same everywhere

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.868
along its trajectory.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:25.620
So let's consider a
static observer sitting

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.099
in the Schwarzschild spacetime.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:50.130
OK, I'm going to require
G-alpha-beta U-alpha

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.864
U-beta to be equal to minus 1.

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:58.730
And I will require that this
have some timelike piece,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.580
that this observer is static.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.450
So their spatial components
of their four-velocity

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.880
are equal to 0.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.890
It looks like, by the way--
just pause one moment here.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.110
It looks like the projector
is on because of--

00:09:17.127 --> 00:09:18.710
I should probably
just leave it as is.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.585
All right, I'm not going
to worry about that.

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:21.970
Just leave that as it is.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.690
Sorry, let's go back to
what I'm talking about here.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.482
So I have a static
observer, so an observer

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.330
who is not moving in space.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.830
They're only moving
through time.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.823
And I need to normalize
their four-velocity.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:34.990
Bear in mind, this is not
a freely-falling observer.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.185
OK, this is an observer who must
be accelerated, in some sense.

00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:41.140
And there must be some
kind of a mechanism that

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.410
is allowing this observer to
hover at the fixed location

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.140
in spacetime where they are at.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.380
So when I put these two
constraints together

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.670
and I tie it into
that spacetime,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:02.420
what I find is that the timelike
component is 1 square root

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.550
of 1 minus 2GM over r.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:17.680
So let's compare the energy
that is emitted at radius

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:26.163
r to the energy that is absorbed
at some radius big R. So

00:10:26.163 --> 00:10:27.080
I'm going to imagine--

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:44.260
And so the reason I formulate
it in this way, what

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.560
I want to do now is
ask myself, well,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.690
what is the energy that
an observer at little r

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.500
would measure here?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.190
What is the energy
that is observed

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:18.650
by the person at
radius capital R?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.500
And now, we know, if I
imagine that these are both

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:37.710
being measured by
static observers,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.010
because P sub T, P
sub 0 or P sub T,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:59.320
because it is a constant as
the light propagates out,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.600
I can take the
ratio of these two.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:11.240
And the energy observed at
capital R versus the energy

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.350
emitted at little r--

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.000
Hang on a second.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.570
As I was looking
over my notes, there

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:35.310
was a result that made no
sense because I had a typo.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.810
So for those of you
following along,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.660
the four-velocity component
should have been a 1

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.857
over the square root of
that quantity I had earlier.

00:12:45.857 --> 00:12:47.440
Suddenly, what I'm
about to write down

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.400
makes a lot more sense.

00:12:52.222 --> 00:12:52.930
So this becomes--

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.130
Let's imagine that
the observer is

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.730
so far away that they are
effectively infinitely

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.760
far away.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.910
So the question
I'm asking is, if I

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.780
imagine that the
light pulse is emitted

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:24.020
at some radius little r, what
would a very distant observer

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.080
measure the energy
of that pulse to be?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.390
OK, so my light
pulse or radio pulse

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.570
is emitted at some
finite radius.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.540
And we'll call e infinity,
the value that is measured

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.860
by a very distant observer.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:54.380
This becomes square
root 1 minus 2GM over r.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.050
Notice that the
energy, no matter

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.290
how energetic the light
is when you emit it,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.350
I described it as
being a radio pulse,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.270
but it could be a laser pointer.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.410
It could be ultraviolet.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.835
It could be a gamma ray.

00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:09.950
You know, you could
just hawk whatever

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.665
massively-powerful source
of photons you want

00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:15.180
and you're pointing it out
in the radial direction

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.530
and hoping that your distant
friend can measure it.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.400
No matter what energy you
emit as you are falling in,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.390
as you approach r
equals 2GM, the amount

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.190
of energy in that beam that
reaches a distant observer

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.000
goes to 0.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:15:04.970
No matter how energetic
my pulse of light,

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:16.670
no energy reaches
distant observers

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:28.310
as the emitter
approaches R equals 2GM.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.460
In a similar way, imagine
that as you are falling in

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.710
and you've got this little
beacon that you are sending

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.910
messages out to your
distant friends,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.450
imagine you send them out
with pulses that are separated

00:15:41.450 --> 00:16:04.180
by delta T. So the person
in the falling frame

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.610
turns his beacon on for
a moment every delta

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.410
T. Let's say delta
T is every second.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.770
The interval between pulses,
as measured far away,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.050
one can show using a
similar kind of calculation.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.220
You pick up a factor of 1 over
square root 1 minus 2GM over r.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:03.800
This goes to infinity
as r goes 2GM.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.099
So remember, the time
coordinate was originally

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.060
defined by imagining that I can
synchronize all of my clocks

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.750
using light pulses that
are bouncing around.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.540
But what we can kind of see
here is that light pulses that

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.740
are emitted in the
vicinity of r equals 2GM,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.650
they're kind of
going to hell, OK?

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.120
So if I imagine, let's just
say for the sake of argument,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.480
I'm using a green laser
pointer as the thing

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.110
that I use for my Einstein
synchronization procedure.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.760
And suppose that I communicate
what time is on the clock

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.280
by a modulation of the signal.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.077
So suppose that I
modulate it by putting

00:17:49.077 --> 00:17:51.410
little spaces on it that tend
to be about a second long.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.327
Or let's just say it's
like a microsecond long

00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:55.850
so I can really pack some
information into that.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:02.920
Well, the laser pointers that
are emitting from r equals 2GM,

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.350
their signal infinitely
redshifts away.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.630
They lose all their energy.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.330
So they're not green.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.710
If they're really close
to it, maybe they'll

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.335
be red when they get
to the next thing.

00:18:10.335 --> 00:18:13.660
Instead of being a
pulse every microsecond,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.550
it'll be every two microseconds.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.900
And the closer we get to
it, the more redshifted

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.850
it becomes and the more extended
the interval between pulses

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.350
becomes.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.890
I'm going to post
to the 8.962 website

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.570
a set of notes that
sort of cleans up

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.260
this calculation a little
bit, just goes through this

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.560
in a little bit more detail.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.260
It was something I
wrote in the Spring 2019

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.970
semester in response
to a good question

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.910
that a student had
asked me about this.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.260
And I think they do a nice
job of just going over

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.130
this calculation.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.547
And they give a
couple of examples

00:18:46.547 --> 00:18:47.770
of the way this is behaving.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.690
The key thing which
I want to emphasize

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:57.895
is that as r goes to 2GM,
what we see is that--

00:18:57.895 --> 00:18:59.270
well, let's just
put it this way.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.030
In fact, let's
remove the word "as."

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:11.090
The surface r equals
2GM corresponds

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.320
to infinite redshift.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.470
OK, we've talked already
a little bit about,

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.730
if I have light climbing out
of a gravitational field,

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.000
the light gets a little bit
redder as it climbs out.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.560
Well, at this
particular surface,

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.830
the sphere of radius
2GM in this spacetime,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.953
if you can get down to
there, that redshift

00:19:40.953 --> 00:19:41.870
then becomes infinite.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.560
All of the energy is drained
out of it as it climbs out.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.800
So what this
basically tells us is

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.190
that this surface breaks
the Einstein synchronization

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.120
procedure and it renders
that time coordinate bad,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.600
at least if we are concerned
about understanding things

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.020
right at this surface.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.460
OK, as long as we're
concerned with the exterior

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.430
of the surface, that's
not a problem, OK?

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.680
Everything works fine
as long as we move away

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.120
from this coordinate
singularity,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.220
sort of in the
same way that many

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.800
of the pathologies
associated with the spherical

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.870
coordinate system here,
the north and south pole,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.162
they are fine as long as
you're not trying to do things

00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:42.850
like measure the longitude
angle corresponding to the North

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:43.350
Pole.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.083
So this is not
even well-defined.

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.500
In the same way,
this is basically

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.380
telling us that the coordinate
T in which we wrote down

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.180
this spacetime isn't really
well-defined at r equals 2GM.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:01.930
So what we need to do, if we
want to try to get some-- hey,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.340
I'm over here, camera!--

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.650
if we want to try to get
a little bit of insight

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.794
as to what is going on here, we
need a better time coordinate.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.070
So I'm going to
talk about a couple.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.710
And the way that we're
going to formulate

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.210
these is all the
pathologies are revealed

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.280
when we look at the behavior
of light propagating

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.047
in this spacetime.

00:21:33.047 --> 00:21:34.380
So let's play around with light.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.140
Let's look at null
geodesics in this spacetime.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.480
So to begin with, let's stick,
for just the next couple

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.292
of moments, with the original
Schwarzschild coordinates.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.510
OK, so I'm going to
look at null geodesics.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.510
So I'm going to set 0,
and I'm gonna ask myself,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.440
how does it move through
an interval at dt

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.910
and an interval of dr?

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:29.570
OK, so we can solve
this to find how,

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.090
if an object is moving on
a radial null geodesic,

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.000
how do dt and dr behave?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.983
How does dt dr behave?

00:22:35.983 --> 00:22:36.650
Put it that way.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.570
OK, so that's what
my dt dr looks like.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.330
Plus, the plus sign
corresponds to a solution

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.700
that is moving the
outward in all direction.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.780
Minus sign is an inward
directed null geodesic.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.290
These define what we consider
to be the opening angle.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:23.240
So dt dr defines the opening
angle of a light cone.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:45.620
So if we go to very,
very, very large r,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.990
OK, we get dt dr equals 1.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.470
And this corresponds in
units in which c equals 1

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.570
to light moving on a 45 degree
angle in a spacetime diagram.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.675
This is familiar behavior
from special relativity.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:28.505
But as r goes to 2GM,
we see dt dr going to 0.

00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:29.880
Let's make a sketch
and see what,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.020
sort of, dt dr, what the
tangent to a null geodesic

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.580
looks like in the t-r plane
as a function of radius.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.490
So this little
dash here means I'm

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.000
sort of imagining that I'm
going to stretch my r axis so

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.030
that, out here, you're
in the asymptotically

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.332
flat region where things
look like special relativity.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.290
So here we are out in this
asymptotically flat region.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.540
My outward-going
light ray goes off

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.040
at 45 degree angle
in the r-t plane.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.110
Inward one goes at a 45
degree angle pointing inside.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.320
Down here in the
stronger field, it's

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.370
going to be a little
bit steeper than this.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:03.360
And so the opening angle of
my light cone is closing up.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.550
Here, we'll have
closed up a lot more.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.570
Here, it's closed up
practically all the way.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.420
Now, as I approach r
equals 2GM, both the inward

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.040
and the outward
direction in these

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.160
coordinates go parallel to 2GM.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.580
So you can see the
collapse of the light cone

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:47.720
in these coordinates
as you approach

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.820
this coordinate singularity.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.680
So we need a healthier
coordinate system.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.980
One thing that we can do is
we can move the pathology out

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.070
of our time coordinate and
into our radial coordinate

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.717
with the following definition.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:16.480
Suppose you choose a radial
coordinate r-star such

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.960
that dt equals plus or
minus dr-star everywhere.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.560
OK?

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:27.310
So if I replace my
horizontal axis with--

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.670
pardon me-- if I replace
my horizontal axis

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:35.400
with the r-star, this will be
45 degree angles everywhere.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.190
OK?

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:51.500
But to make this work,
what you find is r-star

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.360
must look like this.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.620
What you basically see is
that this coordinate system

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.650
takes r equals 2GM
and it moves it

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.878
to r-star equals minus infinity.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.780
So the way that this
coordinate representation,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.880
that this different
radial coordinate,

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.190
the way that this makes
the light cones always

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.373
have 45 degree opening--

00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.790
really 90 degrees opening--
it makes the light rays always

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.470
go off at 45 degree angles
is by essentially constantly

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.380
stretching the radial
axis so that this guy just

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.780
gets stretched out so that
it's opening at 90 degrees.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.260
This guy is stretched
a little bit less.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.927
This guy is stretched
a little bit less.

00:28:42.927 --> 00:28:45.280
Basically, not stretched
when you're really far away.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.590
But as you approach
r equals 2GM,

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.050
you're infinitely stretching
at these coordinates.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:29:11.270
These are known as tortoise
coordinates, basically,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.100
because you start
walking, taking ever

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.650
slower and slower steps.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.140
Even steps, if you imagine
you're stepping evenly

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.620
in r-star, you're taking ever
smaller and smaller steps

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.150
in r, as you approach the
infinite redshift surface.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:42.620
So with that tortoise
coordinate defined,

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.110
you use that as an
intermediary to define

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.530
a couple of new coordinates
for your spacetime that

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.970
are adapted to radiation.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:03.980
So we're going to define
v to be t plus r-star.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.320
And the importance
of this is that this

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.290
is a coordinate that's not
hard to convince yourself

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.780
this is constant on an
in-going radial null ray.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.520
I'm going to define a coordinate
U to be t minus r-star.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:44.884
And this is constant on
outgoing radial null rays.

00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:45.384
OK?

00:30:48.472 --> 00:30:49.930
So this basically
means that if I'm

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:55.330
working in this
coordinate system, r-star,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.970
if I want to know the
behavior of this guy,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.660
well, an outgoing
radial null ray,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.660
you just might say, ah,
that's the null ray that

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.160
has U equals 17.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.660
OK?

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.450
And that will then
pick out, basically,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.280
a whole sequence of
events along which

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.008
that null ray has propagated.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.430
And, you know, as you
can see, it vastly

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.410
simplifies how we describe it.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:24.030
So once you've defined
these two coordinates,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.040
you can rewrite the
Schwarzschild spacetime

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.090
in terms of them.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.983
It is generally best to choose--

00:31:29.983 --> 00:31:32.400
So we're going to take this
another step in just a moment,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.390
but we'll start--

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:38.770
you choose either V or U, and
you replace the Schwarzschild

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.270
time.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:58.730
So let's use V to replace time.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.800
So when you go and you look at
what your new coordinate system

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.850
looks like--

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.760
and remember, the way you
do this is the usual thing,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.820
you're going to make your
matrix of partial derivatives

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.380
between your old
coordinate system.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:23.400
So your old coordinates
are t, r, theta, and phi.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.662
And then they go over
to v, r, theta, and phi.

00:32:28.662 --> 00:32:29.162
OK?

00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:35.520
So you make your matrix of
partial derivatives describing

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.120
this.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.060
And here's what
you find when you

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:45.843
change to the metric in
the new representation.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.115
Notice, there's no dr
squared term at all.

00:32:58.115 --> 00:32:59.330
OK?

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.430
We do still see something
that's, you know,

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.280
at least a coordinate
singularity at r equals 2GM.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.430
We haven't quite gotten
rid of it entirely here.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.650
But we've definitely
mollified the impact

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.480
of this coordinate singularity.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.270
So in this coordinate
system, you can then

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:22.640
set ds squared equal to 0,
and you find two solutions

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.290
describing radial null curves.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.600
So dv dr equals 0 for in-going.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.710
And, you know, by
definition, these things

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.080
are constant on an
in-going radial null ray.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.540
And so as you move along
it, V remains constant.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.690
OK, and you get something a
little bit more complicated

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.580
for the outgoing one.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.796
Let's redraw this using
my new coordinates, OK?

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:36.996
So I'm going to leave
my horizontal axis as r.

00:34:36.996 --> 00:34:46.810
So I'm going to make my
time axis be v. So out here,

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.110
here's my in-going null ray.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.409
And here's my, eh--
let's make that

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.170
a little closer to 45 degrees.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.720
Here's my outgoing null ray.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.040
OK?

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.920
As I move in to smaller
and smaller values of r,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.370
notice in the limit,
as r goes to 2GM,

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.790
the slope becomes infinite.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.410
OK, so this thing gets steeper.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:25.050
This one keeps pointing in, so
this guy gets steeper, steeper.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:33.668
Right here, it lies pointing
exactly straight up.

00:35:33.668 --> 00:35:35.710
What's kind of cool is
that in these coordinates,

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.750
I can actually look at what it
looks like inside this thing.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.490
And so inside, this guy tips
over and gets a negative slope

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.390
and looks like this.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.160
Now, bear in mind,
these two things,

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.530
they denote the null rays.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:59.750
All radial timelike
trajectories,

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.450
and indeed all
timelike trajectories,

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:08.530
not just the radial ones,
all timelike trajectories

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:16.690
must follow a world line that
is bounded by these two sides.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:34.050
OK, so if I'm out here,
everything in here

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.670
describes trajectories that a
timelike observer can follow.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.920
Everything in here
describes a trajectory

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.790
a timelike observer can
follow, everything in here,

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.230
everything in here.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:55.200
Notice, when I am at this one
here, right at r equals 2GM,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.660
every allowed timelike
trajectory points towards r

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.770
equals 0.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.820
At best, I can
imagine an observer

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.030
who's very close to the speed
of light who sort of skims

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.052
along inside of this thing.

00:37:13.052 --> 00:37:14.510
But they are
timelike, so they will

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.460
have a little bit of a slope
that points them inward.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.420
OK.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.700
As you move inside r equals
2GM, it's even more so.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.695
OK, you can't even sort
of go parallel to the r

00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:56.580
equals 2GM line.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.230
They all point
towards this thing.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.320
Once you get to r equals
2GM, all trajectories,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.740
as they move to the future,
must move to smaller radius.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.690
What this tells
us, in particular,

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:43.050
is that once you have
reached r equals 2GM,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.920
you are never coming back.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.140
All allowed
trajectories, everything

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.480
that is permissible by
the laws of physics,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.550
moves along a trajectory
that points towards r

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.940
equals 0 once you hit
that r equals 2GM line.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.020
Because of this, this
surface r, this surface

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.510
of infinite redshift
is given the name--

00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:35.680
Let me come back to
the point I was making.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.420
So the surface r equal
2GM, nothing that crosses

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.550
it is ever going to come back.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:47.530
This surface of
infinite redshift,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.700
we call an event horizon.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.290
OK?

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.725
No events that are on
the other side of r

00:40:05.725 --> 00:40:10.030
equals 2GM can have any
causal influence on events

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.700
on the outside.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.910
If you have a spacetime with
an event horizon like this

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.020
and this one that we are
talking about right here,

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.170
I'm going to talk at the
end of my final lecture

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.435
that I record about--

00:40:51.435 --> 00:40:53.310
Maybe, actually, I'm
gonna do it in this one.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.030
Yeah, I am.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.770
So at the end of this
lecture that I'm recording,

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.812
I'm going to go over a
couple of other spacetimes

00:40:57.812 --> 00:40:59.590
that have this structure.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.790
Such spacetimes are called--

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:32.080
wait for it-- such spacetimes
are called black holes.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.040
They are black because light
cannot get out of them.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.010
And they are holes because
you just jump into 'em,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.180
and you ain't never coming out.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.720
So let me pause for
just one moment.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.720
I want to send a quick
note to the ODL person who

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.916
is helping me out here.

00:41:49.916 --> 00:41:52.030
I just want to let her
know that this lecture may

00:41:52.030 --> 00:42:00.033
run a tiny bit long,
since I spent a moment

00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:02.200
chatting with a police
officer who checked in on me.

00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:34.920
OK, if you're
watching, Elaine, hi!

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.860
So I just sent you a
quick note, letting

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.150
you know that I'm likely
to run a little bit long.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.530
All right, let's get
back to black holes.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:49.010
So to sort of call out
some of the structure

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:53.090
of this spacetime, I want
to spend just a few minutes

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:58.160
talking about one final
coordinate transformation that

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.880
is very useful, but
looks really weird.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.170
So just bear with me
as I go through this--

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.560
a very useful, but
unquestionably somewhat

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.613
obtuse coordinate
transformation.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.288
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:24.580
to define a coordinate v-prime.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.260
This is given by
taking the exponential

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:45.010
of the in-going coordinate
time V, normalized for GM.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.570
U prime will be
the exponent of U,

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.020
a time that works well for
the outgoing coordinate system

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.090
divided by 4GM.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:00.420
I'm then going to
define capital T

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:08.720
to be 1/2 V-prime
plus U-prime, capital

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.400
R to be 1/2 V-prime
minus U-prime.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.770
It's then simple to
show, where simple

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.440
is professor speak for
"a student can probably

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.895
do it in an hour or so."

00:44:31.895 --> 00:44:34.670
It's sort of tedious,
but straightforward,

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:36.620
just hooking together
lots of definitions

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.660
and slogging through a
couple of identities.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:56.400
It's simple to show
that capital T relates

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:03.010
to Schwarzschild time T and
Schwarzschild radius r like so.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:03.885
There's two branches.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.580
OK, so this is how one
relates capital T and capital

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:54.460
R to Schwarzschild t and
Schwarzschild r in the region

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.490
r greater than or equal to 2GM.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:48.990
You find a somewhat
different solution

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.768
in the region r less than 2GM.

00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:53.310
So if you're looking
at this and kind

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.250
of going, "what the hell
are you talking about here,"

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:56.810
that's fine.

00:47:03.446 --> 00:47:06.496
Let me just write down
two more relationships.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.560
And then I'll describe
what this is good for.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.660
So a particularly
clean inversion

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:48.460
between TR and the
original Schwarzschild tr,

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:56.720
both the r greater than 2GM
and r less than 2GM branches

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.055
can be subsumed into this.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:16.360
And you find T over R looks
like the hyperbolic tangent

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:25.920
T over 4GM when
you're in the exterior

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:34.060
and the hyperbolic
cotangent in the interior.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:38.780
So these rather
bizarre-looking coordinates,

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:52.806
these are known as
Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates.

00:48:59.663 --> 00:49:01.080
I'll just leave
that down like so.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.987
So when one goes into this,
I'm not going to deny it,

00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:08.820
this is a bizarre looking
coordinate system.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.490
OK, but it's got
several features

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:15.960
that make it very
useful for understanding

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.260
what is going on physically
in this spacetime.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.990
So first, if you
rewrite your metric

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:53.050
in terms of capital T and
capital R, what you get

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.680
is a form that has
no singularities.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.620
It's well-behaved everywhere,
except at r equals 0.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.530
So you do get a
singularity there,

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.810
things blow up as r goes to 0.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.903
There's no other
coordinate pathologies.

00:50:27.748 --> 00:50:29.540
And then you get sort
of an angular sector.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.480
It's actually cleanest in terms
of the Schwarzschild radius r,

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.330
so we'll leave it
in terms of that.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.400
One thing which
is nice is notice

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:51.050
that radial null
geodesics, they simply

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:59.085
obey dt equals plus or
minus dr everywhere, OK?

00:50:59.085 --> 00:51:01.460
The only place where you run
into a little bit of problem

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.360
is as r goes to 0.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.910
And that's special, OK?

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.910
So I got that just by setting
ds squared equal to 0.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.280
It's radial, so my
D-omega goes to 0.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.080
And then just dt equals
plus or minus dr.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.840
So that's really nice, OK?

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.960
I'm gonna make a sketch
in just a moment.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.940
And the fact that I know
light always moves along

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.220
45 degree lines in
this coordinate system

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.310
is going to help me to
understand the causal structure

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:33.784
of this spacetime.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.670
The causal structure is
what I mean by which events

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:45.170
can influence other events.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.450
What can exert a causal
influence on what?

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.890
So as I move on, I'm going to
make a sketch in just a moment,

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:10.010
I want to highlight
a couple of behaviors

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.920
that we see that are
really sort of called out

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.805
in this mapping between
the two coordinate systems.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:29.360
So notice that a surface
of constant Schwarzschild

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:37.780
radius, constant r
forms a hyperbola

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.311
in the Kruskal-Szekeres
coordinates.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:09.020
Notice that surfaces
of constant time,

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.330
they form lines
in that they form

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:14.870
lines of slope t over r
equal to some constant.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:39.370
So they are lines with t over
r equaling, on the exterior,

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.510
let's just focus
on the exterior,

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:45.530
they have a slope that's given
by the hyperbolic tangent of t

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.030
over 4GM.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.450
On the interior--
replaced with cotangent,

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.997
hyperbolic cotangent.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.200
The last thing which I'd like
to note before I make a sketch

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:10.520
here is let's look at
the special surface

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.770
of infinite redshift,
this event horizon.

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:35.150
So if I plug in r equals
2GM, plug this in over here,

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.810
I get t squared minus
r squared equals 0.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.300
This is the asymptotic
limit to those hyperbolae.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:50.260
They just become lines t
equals plus or minus r.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.980
So the event horizon in this
coordinate representation

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.790
is just going to be a
pair of lines crossing

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.470
in the origin of these
coordinate systems,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.530
OK, a pair of 45
degree lines crossing

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.260
into this coordinate system.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:10.690
Notice, also, that t
equals plus or minus r,

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:25.260
this corresponds to
Schwarzschild t going to

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.720
plus or minus infinity.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:34.260
So this, indeed, is a
weird, singular limit

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.560
of the Schwarzschild
time coordinate.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.030
So you can find much prettier
versions of this figure

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:46.800
than the one I'm about
to attempt to sketch.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.300
Let's see what I
can do with this.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:56.630
So horizontal will be the
Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate

00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:00.620
r, vertical will be
the coordinate t.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:28.070
Here is the event horizon,
r equals t or little r

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.960
equals 2GM.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:44.870
Some different surface of r
equal to some constant value

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:50.500
greater than 2GM will live
on a hyperbola like so.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:02.630
Some value of r equals
constant, but less than 2GM,

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.500
lies on a hyperbola like so.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.550
In particular, there is
one special hyperbole

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:19.380
corresponding to r equals 0.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:30.530
And this is where my artistry
is going to truly fail me.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.442
This is an infinite
tidal singularity.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.110
Now, the thing which
is particularly

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.010
useful about this
particular coordinate system

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:47.140
is, remember, light always
moves in the capital R,

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.660
capital T coordinates.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:56.650
It always moves on lines that go
dt equals plus or minus dr. So

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.960
what you can see is that
imagine I start here

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.332
and I send out a
little light pulse,

00:58:05.332 --> 00:58:10.790
OK, a radially outgoing
light pulse, it will always

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:17.090
go away and go to larger and
larger values of r, just sort

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:20.840
of constantly moves along
this particular trajectory.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.960
Let me write out again
what I'm doing here.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:36.670
So a radial outgoing light ray,
it will follow dt equals dr.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.840
But notice that this line goes
parallel to the event horizon.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.720
If I am on the
inside of this guy

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.310
and I try to make a light
pulse that goes outside,

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.430
points in the radial
direction, all it does

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.470
is, in these coordinates,
it moves parallel

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.430
to the event horizon.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.780
It can never cross it.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.560
And in fact, because
this is a hyperbola,

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.480
one finds that even
though you have

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.530
tried to make this guy as
outgoing as outgoing can be,

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:13.920
it will eventually intersect the
r equals 0 tidal singularity.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.260
Since I cannot have
any event, here,

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.570
that communicates with any
event on the other side of this,

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:47.170
this region, everything
at r less than 2GM,

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:52.060
these will be causally
disconnected--

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.460
not "casually," pardon me.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:13.010
They are causally
disconnected from the world

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.880
that lies outside of r is 2GM.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.340
So in my notes and in
Carroll's textbook,

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.080
there is another
coordinate system

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.920
that you can do which
essentially takes

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.660
points that are
infinitely far away

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.160
and brings them into a
finite coordinate location.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.802
And that final thing,
it puts it in what

01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:37.635
are called Penrose
coordinates and it allows

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:40.560
you make what's called
the Penrose diagram, which

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:46.200
displays, in a very simple way,
how different events are either

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.610
causally connected or causally
disconnected from the others.

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:54.150
Fairly advanced stuff, not
important, but many of you

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.530
may find it interesting.

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.110
Happy to talk
further, once we all

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.825
have the bandwidth to have
those kinds of conversations.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.218
So let me summarize.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:31.440
So the summary is that this
spacetime, so earlier we

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.740
were looking at the spacetime
of a spherically symmetric fluid

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.390
object.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.480
We found a
particularly clean form

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.480
for the exterior of that object,
where it was a vacuum solution.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:06.490
If we imagine a spacetime
that has this everywhere,

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:16.220
then we get this solution
that we call a black hole.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.520
So I emphasize this
is vacuum everywhere,

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.890
but sort of the analysis kind
of goes to hell at r equals 0.

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.890
So there are some singular
field equations there trying

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.600
to describe the stress energy.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.810
Its behavior as
you approach there,

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:36.460
let's just say we're not
quite sure what's going on.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.810
In this coordinate system,
we see weird things

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:49.730
happening as we
approach r equals 2GM.

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:51.500
This is simply a
coordinate singularity.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.850
There's really nothing going
bad with the physics here.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:59.060
But our attempts to
use a time coordinate

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.510
that's based on,
essentially, the way light

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.270
moves in empty space, it's
failing in this region.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.600
And all of this lecture is
about uncovering this and seeing

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.700
that, in fact, this is a surface
of infinite redshift beyond

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.000
which things cannot communicate.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.290
So this is one of the big
discoveries that came out

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.200
of general relativity,
OK, this creature we

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.860
call the black hole.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.140
It is not the only solution of
the Einstein field equations

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.600
that we call a black hole.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.690
Let me talk briefly
about two others.

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:58.960
So another one has a spacetime
that looks like this.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.030
So where did this come from?

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.240
Well, suppose I bung this
through the Einstein field

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.520
equations, what I find is that
it comes from a non-zero stress

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.300
energy tensor.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:44.660
In fact, it's a stress energy
tensor that looks like this.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.644
Pardon me.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.990
This is a stress energy tensor
of a Coulomb electric field

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.130
with total charge q.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.480
This represents a
charged black hole.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.790
It turns out if you analyze
this thing carefully,

01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:13.980
you find it has
an event horizon.

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:30.140
It turns out to be
located at G quantity that

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.110
involves the square root of
m squared minus q squared.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.820
Now, if q-- don't even ask me
what the units are that this is

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.490
being measured in, they're
pretty goofy units--

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:43.580
but if, in these units,
the magnitude of q

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.000
is greater than m,
there is no horizon.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.340
There is still, however, an
infinite tidal singularity at r

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.780
equals 0.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.540
So such a solution
would give us what is

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.530
known as a naked singularity.

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.530
I have a few comments and I
have a couple notes on these.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.710
But they're not as
important as other things

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:07.870
I'd like to talk about.

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:10.570
You might wonder, where
does that r horizon actually

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:11.458
come from?

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:13.750
OK, that is what you get when
you find the route, where

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.793
you look for the place where
the metric function vanishes.

01:07:17.793 --> 01:07:19.960
OK, you notice there's only
one metric function that

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.960
appears in there, 1
minus 2GM over r plus q

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.800
squared over r squared.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.490
So in general, if
you have what's

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:31.330
known as a stationary
spacetime, you can find

01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:36.440
coordinates such that
surfaces of constant r

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.110
are spacelike surfaces.

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:43.590
If you look for the place
where a surface of constant r

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:49.290
makes a transition from being
a spacelike surface to being

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:55.980
a null surface, that
tells you that you

01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.470
have located an event horizon.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.640
OK, this is discussed in
a little bit more detail

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.359
in my notes.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.950
There's also some
very nice discussion

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:40.040
in Carroll's textbook.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.840
What it boils down
to is that if you

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.680
can find a radial coordinate
that allows you to do this,

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.649
then the condition G
upstairs r upstairs r

01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:52.514
equals 0 defines your
event horizon, OK?

01:08:52.514 --> 01:08:55.010
It just so happens
that it's also

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.800
equal to G downstairs t
downstairs t equals 0,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.899
in this case and in
the Schwarzschild case.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.840
But it's not like that
for all black holes

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.310
that you can write down.

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:07.760
In particular, let me write
down the final black hole

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.479
spacetime I want to
discuss in this lecture.

01:09:15.564 --> 01:09:17.439
This is gonna take a
minute, so bear with me.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:53.500
OK, so in this spacetime, the
symbol delta I've written here,

01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:00.430
this is r-squared minus
2GM r plus a squared.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:07.093
Rho squared is r squared
plus a squared cosine

01:11:07.093 --> 01:11:08.260
of the square root of theta.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.940
This thing turns
out, if you compute

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.850
the inverse metric
components, you

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:23.760
find that g upstairs r upstairs
r is proportional to delta.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:31.230
And so there is a horizon
where delta equals 0.

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.160
Sorry.

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:02.130
That turns out to be located at
a radius that looks like this.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:13.330
This represents the spacetime
of a spinning black hole.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:18.870
It was discovered by Roy Kerr, a
mathematician from New Zealand.

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:25.100
I think this was actually
a big part of his PhD work.

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:41.590
So it is known as
a Kerr black hole.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:49.780
The parameter a is related to
the angular momentum, the spin

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.720
angular momentum of the
black hole in the units

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.090
that we measure these,
normalized to the mass.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:09.310
So notice that in order for
this to actually have a horizon,

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:13.900
you need that a to be
less than or equal to GM.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.990
If it saturates
that bound, then you

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:19.750
get what's known as
a maximal black hole.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:21.550
So it has a couple of
noteworthy features.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.570
First, it is not
spherically symmetric.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.530
If it were
spherically symmetric,

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.400
we could write the d theta
squared d phi squared piece,

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.130
we could find some
radial coordinate such

01:13:53.130 --> 01:14:06.190
that there was
some simple radius

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:13.840
such that G theta
theta was simply sine

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.420
squared G theta theta.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.870
This is the condition that
defines spherical symmetry.

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:25.280
And there is no
angle-independent radial

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.040
coordinate that
allows you to do that.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:37.730
Notice also that
there is a connection

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:40.260
in this coordinate
system between t and phi.

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:58.070
Gt phi is equal to minus 2 GM
a r sine squared theta over rho

01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:59.230
squared.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:00.770
Why minus 2 and not minus 4?

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:06.510
Well, remember what I have there
is Gt phi dt d phi plus G phi

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.150
t d phi dt.

01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:15.040
One can show that this
term, it reflects the kind

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.180
of physics in which the
spin of the black hole

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.900
introduces a spinning,
almost magnetic-like element

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.760
to gravitation.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.810
If you guys do the
homework assignment

01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:33.040
I have assigned in which you
compute the linearized effect

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.350
on a spacetime of
a spinning body,

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:37.790
you'll get a flavor of this, OK?

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:41.060
This ends up giving you,
that calculation gives you

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.360
a similar term in the spacetime
which further analysis

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.370
shows leads to bodies.

01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:49.850
Essentially, what you find is
that if you have an orbit that

01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:53.240
goes in the same
sense as the body's

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.380
spin versus an orbit that
goes in the opposite sense

01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:58.430
of the body's spin,
there's a splitting

01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.390
in the orbit's
properties due to that.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.890
OK?

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.720
So it breaks the
symmetry between what

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.400
we call a prograde orbit
and a retrograde orbit.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:11.660
This is one of the most
important solutions

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.260
that we know of in general
relativity because of a result

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.520
that I'm going to discuss now.

01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.540
Oh, first of all, I should
mention that, in fact, you

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.520
can combine charge with spin.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.390
I'm not going to write down
the result because it's just

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:33.060
kind of messy.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.060
But it does exist
in closed form.

01:16:43.623 --> 01:16:45.040
If you're interested
in this, read

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.680
about what is called the
Kerr-Newman solution.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.030
So if you're keeping score, we
have this spherically symmetric

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:58.030
black hole, which
only has a mass,

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:02.030
you have the charged black hole
whose name I forgot to list.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.530
Ah!

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:03.730
Sorry about that.

01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:21.843
This guy is known as the
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.

01:17:21.843 --> 01:17:23.510
One of those O's, I
believe, is supposed

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:24.677
to have a stroke through it.

01:17:24.677 --> 01:17:27.580
Those of you who speak
Scandinavian languages

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:31.310
can probably spell it and
pronounce it better than I can.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:32.860
So we have
Schwarzschild, which is

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:37.300
only mass, Reissner-Nordstrom,
which is mass in charge,

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:41.310
Kerr, which is mass and
spin, and Kerr-Newman, which

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:44.110
is mass, spin, and charge.

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:47.010
You might start thinking,
all right, well,

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.400
does this keep going?

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.520
Do I have a solution for a
black hole that's got, you know,

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.080
northern hemisphere bigger
than the southern hemisphere?

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.100
You know, every time
you think about adding

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.230
a bit of extra sort of
schmutz to this thing,

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:05.200
do I need another solution?

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.990
Well, let me describe
a remarkable theorem.

01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:40.080
The only stationary spacetimes
in 3 plus 1 dimensions with

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:47.980
event horizons are the
Kerr-Newman black holes--

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:19.520
completely parameterized
by mass, spin, and charge.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:26.720
If you take the Kerr-Newman
solution, you set charge to 0,

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.700
you get Kerr.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.230
If you take Kerr and
you set spin to 0,

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:32.010
you get Schwarzschild.

01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:33.600
So the Kerr-Newman
solution gives me

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.860
something that includes these
other ones as sort of a subset.

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:39.540
And what this theorem
states is that the only-- so

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.240
stationary means
time-independent.

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.650
So in other words,
the only spacetimes

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:05.760
that are not dynamical, but
that have event horizons,

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.050
at least with three space
and one time dimension,

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:10.650
are the Kerr-Newman black holes.

01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:14.340
Once you know these, you have
characterized all black holes

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.850
you can care about.

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:20.610
And in fact, in any
astrophysical context,

01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:23.070
any macroscopic
object with charge

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.580
is rapidly neutralized by
ambient plasma that just sort

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.520
of fills all of space.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.840
And so this Kerr
solution, in fact,

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.610
gives an exact mathematical
description to every black hole

01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:41.740
that we observe in the universe.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.840
That is an amazing statement.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.340
OK?

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.430
Of course, as a physicist,
you want to test this.

01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:50.710
And this, in fact,
is much of what

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:53.220
my research and research of
many of my colleagues is about.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.470
Can we actually formulate
tests of this Kerr hypothesis?

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:58.210
And many of us have
spent our careers

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:00.010
coming up with such things.

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:03.280
Suffice it to say, in the
roughly negative 5 minutes

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.850
I have left in this lecture,
that the Kerr metric has

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:09.310
survived every test that
we have thrown at it.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.710
So this metric, like I
said, was essentially

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:21.000
derived by the mathematician
Roy Kerr as his PhD thesis.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.880
And it has really earned him
a place in physicist Valhalla.

01:21:31.245 --> 01:21:32.620
Let me just conclude
this lecture

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.910
by making one comment here.

01:21:39.105 --> 01:21:40.480
An important word
in this theorem

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.280
is the statement that the
only stationary spacetimes

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.320
are the Kerr-Newman ones,
stationary spacetimes

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.810
with event horizons, so the
Kerr-Newman black holes.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:56.380
What this means is that
when a black hole forms,

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:02.920
it may be dynamical, it
may not yet be stationary.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.610
And so the way that
this theorem, which

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:25.150
is known as the No-Hair theorem,
the way that it is enforced

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:31.240
is that, imagine I have
some kind of an object that

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.090
due to physics that we don't
have time to go into here,

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:38.260
imagine that this thing, its
physics changes in such a way

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.350
that its fluid can
no longer support

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:45.510
its own mass against
gravity, and it

01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:47.680
collapses to a black hole.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.180
OK?

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:51.375
Initially, this could be
a huge, complicated mess.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:07.510
So we have a mass, charge, spin,
magnetic fields, who knows?

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:22.120
The No-Hair theorem guarantees
that after some period of time,

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.280
it will be totally characterized
by three numbers-- the mass,

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.470
the spin parameter
a and the charge q.

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:38.500
What goes on is that during
the collapse process,

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.208
radiation is generated.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.650
What this radiation
does is it carries away

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:49.890
gravitational waves, carries
away electromagnetic waves.

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:53.100
Some of this is actually
absorbed by this black hole.

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:58.080
And it does so in such a way
that it precisely cancels out

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.570
everything in the
spacetime that does not

01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:03.210
fit the Kerr-Newman form.

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:10.360
You wind up-- so this is one
of these things where we really

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.830
can only probe this either with
observations that sort of look

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:17.770
at things like black
holes and compact bodies

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:20.500
colliding and
forming black holes

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.540
and looking at what the
end state looks like.

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.640
Or we can do this with
numerical experiments

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.310
where we simulate very
complicated collapsing

01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:29.440
or colliding objects
on a supercomputer

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.850
and look at what
the end result is.

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:35.470
And what we always find is
that the complex radiation that

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.860
is generated in the collapse
and the collision process

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:42.550
always shaves away
every bit of structure,

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:45.070
except for exactly what
is left to leave it

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:47.087
in the Kerr-Newman
form at the end.

01:24:47.087 --> 01:24:48.670
Really, when we do
these calculations,

01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:50.462
we generally wind up
with a Kerr black hole

01:24:50.462 --> 01:24:52.840
because we tend to study
astrophysical problems that

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.820
are electrically neutral.

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.760
So this is a result
that is sometimes

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:05.000
called Price's
theorem, based on sort

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.510
of foundational
calculations that were done

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.340
by my friend Richard Price.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:15.770
He did much of this right around
the time I was born in the days

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:19.700
of being a PhD student and
looking at the behavior

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.880
of highly distorted black holes
and seeing how the No-Hair

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.230
theorem--

01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:25.940
You can imagine making
a spacetime that

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.320
contains what should
be a black hole,

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.445
but you somehow distort it.

01:25:28.445 --> 01:25:31.430
What you find is it
becomes dynamical

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:34.682
and it vibrates in such a way as
to get rid of that distortion.

01:25:34.682 --> 01:25:36.140
And you leave behind
something that

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:40.600
is precisely Kerr or
Kerr-Newman if you have charge.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.770
Price's theorem is a
semi-facetious statement

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:48.290
that tells me everything in the
spacetime that can be radiated,

01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:50.030
is radiated.

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:59.280
In other words, any bit of
structure, any bit of structure

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.500
in the spacetime
that does not comport

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.280
with the Kerr-Newman
solution radiates away

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.730
and only Kerr-Newman is left.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.340
So that concludes this lecture.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:17.050
My final lecture, which I will
record in about 15 minutes,

01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:20.050
is one in which we
are going to look

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.480
at one of the ways in which
we test this spacetime, which

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.900
is by studying the
behavior of orbits

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.830
going around a black hole.

01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:30.210
So I will stop here.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.830
PROFESSOR: OK, I guess
we'll get started.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.453
So last time we talked about
hearing loss, and deafness,

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.040
and cochlear implants.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.660
Any questions?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.645
So did anyone read the Sunday
New York Times yesterday?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.050
My email really lit up when this
front page article showed up

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.410
and it was titled, "Ground
Shaking Noise Rocks NFL

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.730
and Eardrums Take a Big Hit."

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.620
So the reason my email lit
up is because my lab director

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.660
is quoted.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.600
So it's a big deal to be quoted
in the Sunday Times, right?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.130
So this is talking
about the NFL games

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.860
where they have a noise
meter down on the field

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.575
and they encourage the fans
to make a lot of noise.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.700
And apparently at the Seattle
Seahawks recent game--

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.350
whatever-- the
crowd was recorded

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.445
at making 136 decibel
noise in September.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.120
And so it says later on in
the article, "Fans accustomed

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.200
to hollering may--" is that what
they do at the Seahawks games?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.540
"May scoff at the warnings
as nanny state silliness.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.660
But to auditory experts,
the danger is very real.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.820
People think it's cool
or funny, or whatever.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.440
But there is increasing--"
this is a quote "Increasing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.850
evidence that if your ears are
ringing, damage is happening,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.330
said M. Charles Liberman, a
professor of otology at Harvard

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.210
Medical School, and the director
of a hearing research lab

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.260
at the Massachusetts
Eye And Ear Infirmary."

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.259
So he's a director
of the lab where

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.800
we're going to have
a lab tour later.

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.760
"There's something
irreversible going on,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.770
and it's only going to get
worse as you get older.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.870
Liberman's research shows that
even in the immediate effects

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.750
of noise exposure after the
immediate effects subside--

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.710
the ringing, the muffling,
the feeling of pressure-- ears

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.200
do not really recover."

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.360
So noise damage in the news.

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.312
I'll pass it around.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.650
All right.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.539
So yeah, question?

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.163
AUDIENCE: I just have
a quick question.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.225
So when I'm down at the
T, it's extremely loud.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:05.350
Do you happen to know how
loud that is in decibels?

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.450
PROFESSOR: I've never
measured it on the T.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.908
AUDIENCE: I had a
friend who tried.

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:11.970
And the thing on his phone
wouldn't go high enough.

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:13.440
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.800
And a lot of folks have
a sound level meter app.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.547
So how high was the maximum?

00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:23.214
AUDIENCE: The max was 100,
and it more than maxed out.

00:03:23.214 --> 00:03:23.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.660
Well, so I wouldn't be
surprised if it's 110 dB

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.710
on the T. Certain
in between stops

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.130
runs are louder than others
as you know if you ride the T.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.350
So I think that
that's not so damaging

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.390
that it would hurt your hearing.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.930
But if you were the conductor
or the driver on the train,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.404
you really have
to worry about it.

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.070
On the other hand,
if you're the driver,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.890
you have to have good
hearing to respond

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.280
to some kind of signals.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.800
So it's not like they can
just wear hearing protection.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.050
In this article
about NFL fans, they

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.710
said in some games they hand
out those little foam ear

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.750
plugs, which attenuate the
noise as much as 20 dB.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.020
So if you're listening to 120,
put the noise-- ear plug in

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.660
and it goes down to 100.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.260
But it also said that some
people, like children,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.029
can't fit the foam ear
plugs in their ear canal.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.240
So it doesn't work for them.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.090
And some people, like
people who work on the T,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.870
need good hearing.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.010
So today, we're going
to move on and get back

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.210
to the auditory brainstem.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.590
We had talked about the
auditory pathway that comes up

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.410
from the cochlea through
the auditory nerve

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.110
and into the cochlear
nucleus, which

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.850
is the very lowest
level of the brainstem.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.320
And now we're going to
talk about some higher

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.630
levels of the brainstem.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.590
And especially some
pathways that are

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.971
called descending systems
and brainstem reflexes.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.850
So we'll define what
those two things are.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.370
We'll talk especially about
one descending system, which

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.810
is a brainstem reflex called
the olivocochlear neurons.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.180
Their anatomy, their functions,
and their reflex pathway.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.390
And let me just stop and tie in
once again with hearing loss.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.420
These two brainstem
reflexes that I'm

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.820
going to talk about
clearly protect the ear

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.690
from damage due to
high-level sound.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.110
So that is certainly one of the
functions of the Olivocochlear

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.160
neurons.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.360
And we'll see how
that takes place.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.530
The second brain stem
reflex that we'll talk about

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.600
is the middle ear muscle reflex.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.700
There are two muscles
in your middle ear.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.400
When they contract, they
make your sense of hearing

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.260
less sensitive.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.410
Why would you ever
want that to happen?

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.690
Well again, these
muscles contract

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.580
when you're in a high-level
sound environment,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.060
like at the NFL game.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.050
And one of their
functions is to reduce

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.775
the sound getting
into your inner ear.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.610
So to prevent damage from
the high-level sound that

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.755
might otherwise damage
your hair cells.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.710
So that's the subject
of today's talk.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.110
Now, what do I mean by reflexes
and descending systems?

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.560
Well, this is a nice diagram
from Michael Slama, who

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.240
shows in the solid lines
the pathways going up,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.020
which we've been talking about.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.390
And sometimes those pathways
are called ascending systems

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.430
because they go up.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.140
So it says here in
red, the solid lines

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.250
are ascending pathways.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.130
So by ascending, we mean from
a lower level up to a higher.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.250
And ultimately, to the highest
level in the neural pathway

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.905
to the cortex.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.090
There are analogous
descending systems,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.909
which are shown here
in dashed lines.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.450
And I think you can
see some of them.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.570
For example, here's
auditory cortex.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.680
And there's some
dashed lines, which

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.900
means cell bodies sitting
an auditory cortex that

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.810
project their axons down and end
at the next lowest level, which

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.125
is the auditory thalamus
or the medial geniculate.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.300
And so that would be an
example of a descending system

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.960
because the information is
starting at the higher level

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.470
and going down to a lower level.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.590
And at every junction
between nuclei

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.080
you can find descending systems.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.540
And in the auditory pathway,
even at the lowest level,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.740
you have a descending
system that

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.460
starts here in
the superior olive

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.200
and goes all the way
out to the cochlea.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.660
And we talked about some
efferent nerve endings

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.565
on the hair cells
and the nerve fibers.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.670
And that descending system is
called the olivocochlear system

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.200
of neurons because it
starts out in the olive

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.290
and goes to the cochlear.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.170
OK, so that's what
descending systems

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.415
is, starting from higher levels
and going down to lower levels.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.970
Now, how does that work out
with brainstem reflexes?

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.370
Well, we've said that
one of the functions

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.290
of these olivocochlear
neurons would

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.030
be they prevent the
cochlea from being

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.735
damaged by high-level sounds.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.059
Well, when would you
activate that system?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.120
Well, obviously, when
you hear a loud sound.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.460
So the ascending pathway
has to come into the brain,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.300
synapse in the cochlear nucleus,
go up to the olivary complex,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.270
and then come back down to the
cochlear to prevent the damage.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.350
And so that little loop
that I just diagrammed

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.500
could be called
a reflex pathway.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.355
So let's define
what a reflex is.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.160
What is a reflex?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.900
Anybody know?

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.173
What does it mean
to act reflexively?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.140
AUDIENCE: Automatic reaction.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.848
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.215
So an automatic response.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.060
And certainly, these
olivocochlear neurons

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.026
turn on automatically.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.570
And sort of in between the
lines of that definition

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.420
means that the reflex pathway
is operating down here

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.880
in the automatic portion
of your auditory pathway

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.635
in the brainstem.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.150
The part where you think
the auditory cortex

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.810
or the other regions of cortex
doesn't have to get involved.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.910
You don't have to say, OK,
I'm in a loud environment.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.290
Should I respond
with this reflex?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.790
OK.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.910
Yeah, maybe I will.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.230
OK, respond.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.240
You don't have to
think about it.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.000
It's automatic
because it happens

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.740
in the parts of the brain where
things happen automatically.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.610
What other things
happen in the brainstem?

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.070
Well, control of breathing.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.270
You have the motor neurons
that come to your chest muscles

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.580
and your diaphragm that
enable you to breathe.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.060
Those motor neurons are
located in the brainstem.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.430
And the control of respiration
is this brainstem function.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.770
It doesn't have to go
all the way to the cortex

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.850
and have to think about it.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.590
Now, that's not to say that
reflexes, like the breathing

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.160
reflex, you can
say, OK, I'm going

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.750
to stop breathing for a minute.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.470
OK, I'm going to hold my breath.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.930
So you can, via
your higher centers,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.800
say I'm going to send
information down here.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.030
Maybe some of these
other descending pathways

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.810
come down to the
olivocochlear neurons and say,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.972
I'm not going to do this
reflex for a moment.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.305
Of course, you eventually
have to start breathing again.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:21.320
But you can have higher center
control of these reflexes.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.800
It's not that the higher
centers aren't involved.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.980
OK, so another reflex would be
your patellar tendon reflex.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.010
The physician tests when you
go to your doctor's office.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.750
They hit your patellar
tendon with a little mallet

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.510
and see that your leg contracts.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.850
And apparently, everyone
passes that test, right?

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.450
You can't walk into
the doctor's office

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.060
without having some
kind of reflex.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.500
But they're actually testing
for hyper-reflex in that case.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.470
And so some of these
reflexes can be in overdrive.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.920
And that's what the
physician is testing for.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.660
OK, so we are really
interested in what all

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.470
these descending systems do.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.230
What do the descending
systems do in general?

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.170
Well, it actually ends up being
a very hard issue to study.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:25.170
We know that those systems are
there, but what good are they?

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.280
What do they do in
our sense of hearing?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.250
So the classic, old-fashioned
way of studying such a system

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.840
would be to go in
and make a lesion

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.010
and see how the animal's
behavior, the person's behavior

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.800
changes, or do
some kind of test.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.150
But it turns out most of
these descending systems

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.790
are intertwined with their
corresponding ascending

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.500
pathway.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:57.590
So it's very difficult to go
in and make a cut or a burning

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.900
lesion that just lesions one
of the descending pathways

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.805
and not affect the
ascending pathway, which

00:13:04.805 --> 00:13:06.305
would complicate
the interpretation.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.010
The reason that some of
these systems-- for example,

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.930
the olivocochlear
neurons-- are amenable

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.880
and we know a lot
about them-- are

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.210
amenable to experimentation--
is we can selectively

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.980
lesion and stimulate
them in isolation

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.410
from the ascending systems.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.490
And let me show you a diagram
done of the olivocochlear

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.790
system that illustrates that.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.910
So these are the olivocochlear
neurons, these stars here.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.360
There are two types.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.100
The red are the so-called
medial olivocochlear neurons

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.870
because they're sitting
in the medial part

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.865
of the superior olive.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.100
The green ones are so-called
lateral olivocochlear neurons

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.120
because they're sitting
in the more lateral part

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.060
the superior olive.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.900
And this diagram shows the cell
bodies of those olivocochlear

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.110
neurons that are innovating
this cochlea-- sending axons out

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.940
to this cochlea
on the right side.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.120
And that defines this cochlea
as the ipsilateral cochlea.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.860
Ipsi means the same.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.630
So that cochlea gets a name.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.870
That's the ipsilateral cochlear.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.730
And you can see that these
green lateral olivocochlear

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.340
neurons are basically on
the same side of the brain

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.395
stem as the cochlea
that they innervate.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.840
But these medial
olivocochlear neurons

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.119
are distributed on both
sides of the brain.

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:39.035
So there's a little bit
difference in anatomy.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.960
Now, these are a
little bit like neurons

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.094
that we call motor neurons.

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.010
Everybody knows what a
motor neuron is, right?

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.590
It's going from the brain of the
spinal cord out to the muscle.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.600
That's why it's
called a motor neuron.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.014
And when it fires off,
it contracts the muscle

00:14:57.014 --> 00:14:57.930
that it's innervating.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.790
It turns out all the muscles
on the side of the body,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.000
let's say the
ipsilateral muscles,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.475
the motor neurons are located
on that same side of the brain.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.100
So right-side muscles are always
innervated by right-side motor

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.600
neurons.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.760
So this anatomy is a little
bit different than the anatomy

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.240
of motor neurons.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.576
Even though these
neurons are having

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:26.950
an effect in the
cochlea, they're

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.240
not innervating muscles.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.180
They're innervating
hair cells in this case.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.480
They do use the same
neurotransmitter as muscles.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:43.317
So the olivocochlear neurons
use the neurotransmitter

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:43.900
acetylcholine.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.075
And so they would be
called cholinergic.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.180
OK, so they synthesize
the acetylcholine

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.930
and their cell bodies
are transported down

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.490
to the axons and
the nerve terminals.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.730
Out in the cochlea
use acetylcholine.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.910
They release it.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.520
Now, where do they
release it to?

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.710
They release it
to their targets.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.160
And out in the periphery, these
Medial Olivocochlear Neurons,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.650
or the MOC neurons, target
the outer hair cells.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.700
And they release
acetylcholine directly

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.720
onto the outer hair
cells via their synapses.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.510
The lateral
olivocochlear neurons

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.210
come out to the periphery and
they release the acetylcholine

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.420
in their synapses on
the auditory nerve fiber

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.405
peripheral dendrites.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.620
OK, so the innervation
is very distinct.

00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:54.170
What are the auditory
nerve peripheral dendrites?

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.800
Well, those are the ones
we've been talking about.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.680
We've been talking about
auditory nerve fibers.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.084
They start at the inner hair
cells for the most part.

00:17:03.084 --> 00:17:03.875
They send messages.

00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:05.569
That's what this
arrow is indicating.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.335
Send messages into the brain.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.140
When there's a sound,
the membranes move.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.420
The outer hair cells
are electromotile.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.685
The inner hair cells respond.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.609
They send messages,
synaptic messages,

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:21.780
to their nerve fibers.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.872
The nerve fibers spike and they
send information to the brain

00:17:24.872 --> 00:17:26.080
through the cochlear nucleus.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.720
These efferent fibers
are sending messages

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.530
the opposite way.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.680
They're starting in the brain
and going out to the cochlea.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.240
And out in the
cochlea, this arrow

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.740
means that the information
is coming from the brain

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.360
out to the outer hair cells or
the auditory nerve dendrites

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:45.860
here.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.130
Is everybody clear about that?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.500
Now, the anatomy
works out so that you

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.590
can do some pretty
interesting things.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.770
You can make a cut of this nerve
bundle, the olivocochlear nerve

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.740
bundle.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.930
You can stimulate it.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.920
And right there underneath
where the word "brainstem" is,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.800
there's a great
place to make a cut

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.970
or to electrically stimulate
and activate this system.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.864
Well, why don't we use sound
to stimulate the system?

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:16.030
Well, it's a little messier.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.700
It's cleaner to
activate this bundle

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.470
with electrical
stimulation because you

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.130
can put your stimulating
electron right on it

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.255
and only activate that system.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.250
So that's one big advantage.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.650
You can selectively activate
these olivocochlear neurons

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.880
and then study, well,
what the heck do

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.180
they do out in the cochlea?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.410
What changes do they have
when you activate them?

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.000
And what changes happen
when you deactivate them

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.740
and making a cut in the system?

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.910
And de-efferent, if
you will, the cochlea.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.350
And as this list shows, there
are a number of functions.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.860
And if I had to pick one of
these, each of these functions

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.350
has some experimental support.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.840
And I don't think I
would be able to pick

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.410
which is the most important.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.070
Well, sure, if you're
at an NFL game,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.180
you are probably experiencing
a very high sound level.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.560
And so it becomes
important in that situation

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.675
to protect the
cochlea from damage.

00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.440
So it depends on the situation.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.850
But we're going to
go through these.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.930
In turn, I think that
since I mentioned damage,

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.800
and since I don't
have a slide on it,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.190
let me say how that
experimental evidence arises.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.959
It's a very simple
type of experiment.

00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:44.750
You take an animal.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.720
You put it in a high-level
sound environment

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.425
comparable to an
NFL game, 120 dB.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.800
Take the animal out,
you study its cochleas.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.220
You can count the hair cells.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.430
You can measure the responses.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.010
The hearing has become
much less sensitive.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.975
Some of the hair cells
have been killed.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.400
OK, no big deal.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.470
We went over that last time.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.960
Take a second animal.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.550
And in that animal, cut this
olivocochlear bundle going out

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.620
to, let's say, the
ipsilateral cochlea.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.430
The olivocochlear neurons
going to this other side,

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.295
the contralateral cochlea,
leave that intact.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.910
OK, beautiful experiment
because within just one animal,

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.455
you have one side's cochlea
has been de-efferented.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.840
You have cut off
these efferent fibers.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.095
The other side has a
normal innervation.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.400
Expose the animal to 120 dB SPL.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.590
Do the same response metrics.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.510
Test the responses
of the cochlea.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.380
Look at how many hair
cells have been killed.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.075
You find that there is a huge
difference in the two ears.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.480
Where the efference or
these olivocochlear neurons

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.830
have been cut, there's
a lot of damage

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.325
and a lot of loss
of sensitivity.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.880
On the intact side,
it has been protected.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.710
There is less damage
and better responses.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.040
It's more sensitive.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.970
So it's a very, very nice,
very elegant experiment

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.145
that's been done many times.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.520
In probably both
of these systems,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.500
the medials and the laterals
provide such protection

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.750
from damage.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.285
So we can say one
of the functions

00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:45.480
then is then protection.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.970
What do I mean by these
other functions-- shift

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.070
the dynamic range
of hearing, reduce

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.590
the effects of noise masking,
and reduce hearing sensitivity

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.290
when paying attention
to visual tasks?

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.400
OK, we're going to go
over those one by one.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:20.310
For the first one, the
experiment runs like this.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.085
You record from these afferent
auditory nerve fibers.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.210
And instead of cutting
these olivocochlear neurons,

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.110
you stimulate them.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.240
You can put a stimulating
electrode right down there,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.130
right below the
word "brainstem,"

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.590
and activate this bundle.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.860
What happens to the
responses of the nerve fibers

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.020
when you activate this
olivocochlear system?

00:22:47.692 --> 00:22:48.900
And that's what's shown here.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.930
And this experiment has
been done since the 1970s.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.050
This is an old experiment.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.560
This is the response
in terms of the firing

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.100
rate from the auditory nerve.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.040
And in this case, a tone is on.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.970
So you're really driving
the auditory nerve fiber.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.750
So the firing rate is high.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.350
Then, during the
second black bar

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.544
here, you stimulate the
olivocochlear neurons

00:23:17.544 --> 00:23:18.960
that are going out
to the cochlea.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.290
And look what happens
to the firing rate.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.600
It goes almost down to zero.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.160
When you turn that
stimulation off,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.890
the firing rate comes back
to about what it was before.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.630
There's been a huge
inhibition of firing rate

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.735
in the auditory nerve.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.190
If you plot the firing rate as
a function of the tone burst

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.802
level-- so now we're going
to do different tones

00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:48.635
at different levels.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.077
At low tone levels where the
fiber is firing spontaneously,

00:23:54.077 --> 00:23:55.160
there's hardly any effect.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.240
In mid-levels, like we
saw illustrated here,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.940
this is without stimulation.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.430
This is with stimulation.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.716
There's a huge decrease
in firing rate.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:08.310
And up at the
highest levels where

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.760
the fiber has become
saturated-- saturation means

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.710
that even though you're
increasing the tone burst,

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:21.180
you're not increasing the fire
rate coming from the fiber--

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.350
there's very little effect
of this stimulation.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.900
How can that help us?

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.730
We have a dynamic range
problem in hearing.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.440
Most auditory nerve fibers--
forget about the stimulation

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.940
right now.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940
Look at the solid curve.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.690
The dynamic range of most
auditory nerve fibers

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.740
has just 20 or 30 dB
before saturating.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.315
That means the fiber
goes up and it saturates.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.160
What happens when we
get to the NFL game

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.640
or in the better case,
what happens when

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.870
we're in a restaurant
or a bar and we want

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.120
to listen to the speaker
across the table from us?

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.290
Well, that's a pretty
high sound level, 80 dB.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.910
It's not damaging,
but it's high enough

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.740
to saturate our
auditory nerve fibers.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.920
That means when the
added sound level

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.610
of the person across the
table from you, their voice,

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.522
adds to the
background, they're not

00:25:18.522 --> 00:25:21.105
going to change the firing rate
of your auditory nerve fibers.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.250
And the brain won't
know except by seeing

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.525
the person's lips move
that there is speech.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.320
It's much better to
understand any kind of signals

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.460
to be within this rising
function of the firing rate

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.210
curve, not in the
saturated function where

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.990
there's no change
in firing rate.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.510
OK, so how can the
olivocochlear system

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.685
help us with this
dynamic range problem?

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:55.040
Well, I've been emphasizing
the decrease of firing rates.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.580
But as you can see from
this curve with stimulation

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.035
of the OC neurons, the effect
is to shift this function over.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.460
In this case, it's
about a 20 dB shift.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:13.550
And now, at 70 dB, you're in the
dynamic range of the function.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.425
And you're not saturated
anymore as you were before.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.430
So one of the
functions, we think then

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:26.120
from this type of experiment,
is the MOC efference kick in,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.940
reflexively kick in when
you're in a high-level sound

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.200
environment.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.850
And they shift the firing
rate functions over

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.630
so you can now
understand a speaker's

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.285
voice in a high-level
background.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.770
Now, there are
some other factors

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.800
that change an increase of
dynamic range of hearing, which

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.760
I don't think are
important to the course.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.173
But we have talked about
two-tone suppression.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.850
This certainly does
the same kind of thing.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.470
We're going to talk about
contraction of the middle ear

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.140
muscles, which also helps you
with the dynamic range problem.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.150
So this is clearly then,
one important function

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.700
of the olivocochlear neurons.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:24.445
That is, shifting dynamic range.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.260
Now, is there
experimental evidence

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.730
besides what you
see here looking

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.290
at firing rates of
auditory nerve fibers

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:39.780
to suggest that the
olivocochlear system really

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.550
does this?

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.170
There is a little bit.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.630
That is, with animals
trained to detect changes

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.420
in tones in a
background of noise,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.250
they do it a little
bit better when

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.660
they have an intact
olivocochlear system.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.740
You can't do these
experiments in humans

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.080
because it's very difficult
to turn this system off.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.510
We don't know a way of turning
it off or interrupting it.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.550
And people probably call this
system into play reflexively.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.295
So it's difficult to do these
kinds of experiments in humans.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.460
Now, there's another
important function

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.430
of the olivocochlear
system, which is probably

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:33.465
to reduce the effects
of noise masking.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:42.430
And we haven't talked too much
about masking in this course.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.140
I mean, two-tone suppression
is a kind of masking.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:51.200
Masking is where you're
listening to one sound

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.160
and a second sound comes in
and interferes your ability

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.110
to detect that very first sound.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.090
So I have a
demonstration, though,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.260
that I think will convince you
that masking is very important.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.450
And it runs like this.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.580
So the demonstration
is going to be

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.260
you're listening to tone bursts,
which are the pink things here.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.910
And they're at 2,000 Hertz,
so it's going to be kind

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:23.500
of a little bit above
our 1,000 standard

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.185
middle-of-the-hearing-range
frequency.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.245
And it's going to give
you 10 tone bursts

00:29:30.245 --> 00:29:34.090
and they're each going
to be successively softer

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.630
in sound level.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.110
And you're supposed to count
how many steps you can hear.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.340
And I think there
are 10 of them.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.680
We should be able to hear
all 10 with the way I

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.570
have set the level.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.170
The second part
of the demo is now

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.320
the signal is masked
with broadband noise.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.040
So the broadband noise
will come on first.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.530
Shh.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.250
And these tone pips will
be on top of that noise.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.340
And you're supposed to
count now how many tone

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.810
pips you can hear with
the broadband noise.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.640
And I think there's a
little verbiage before this.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.660
Just ignore that.

OK.

PROFESSOR: Five?

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.820
I mean, this is not a
bad illustration, right?

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.076
When the pink tone bursts
get within the black noise,

00:31:20.076 --> 00:31:21.450
they're pretty
much disappearing.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.020
So clearly the noise
was an effective masker

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.180
of the tone pip.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:36.030
Now, we had the example
earlier of the phenomenon

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.530
called two-tone suppression.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.221
And that was measured in
an auditory nerve fiber.

00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:57.470
And everybody should be able
to draw an auditory nerve

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.605
fiber tuning curve.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.510
On the x-axis, we
have the frequency

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.675
of the sound in kilohertz.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.810
And the y-axis, we have
the sound pressure level

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.325
for a response.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.040
An auditory nerve tuning curves,
at least those with high CFs,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.160
look like this.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.570
And the characteristic frequency
is the frequency right here.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.680
In two-tone suppression,
what we had is two tones.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.390
The first tone is
a probe tone, which

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.905
is placed inside the nerve
fibers response area.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.450
And if you look at a
graph of firing rate--

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:51.480
so this is firing-- and
you turn that tone on,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.770
the firing rate is
going to go way up.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:58.550
Maybe 100 spikes per
second because it's

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.570
within the response area.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.440
Now, the second tone, sometimes
called the suppressor,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.410
is put outside the response
area but close to it.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.870
OK, so here's the probe.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.276
This is the probe
tone, high firing rate.

00:33:29.276 --> 00:33:30.650
And now a little
bit later, we're

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.620
going to turn on a second tone.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.336
And this is called
the suppressor.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.410
And I haven't drawn
this very well,

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.590
but when the suppressor
goes on, the firing rate

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.755
can come back down.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.635
This goes off first.

00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:54.230
And come back up.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:56.950
OK.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:01.930
So clearly, at least in the
discharges of auditory nerve

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:07.380
fibers, you can have suppressors
outside the response areas

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.579
that decrease the
response to probes.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.820
This probe tone is going to
be signaled by auditory nerve

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.020
fibers close to that frequency.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.745
So many auditory nerve fibers
have CFs close to 2 kilohertz.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:32.409
This noise has energy
throughout the frequency range,

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.854
if it's absolutely white noise.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:39.310
Some of its noise will be
within the response area,

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.239
but some of it will be
in suppression areas.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:46.409
And these suppression
areas can be

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.979
either side of the
excitatory area.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.199
And they can be big.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:55.349
And in some cases, they can
overrule the excitation,

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:56.349
or at least decrease it.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.740
So some of the reason you
couldn't hear the tone when

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.320
it was masked by
the noise is because

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.480
of two-tone suppression.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.745
This is sometimes called
suppressive masking.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.280
There's another kind of masking
that's important-- it may

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:28.445
be equally important-- and
it's called adaptive masking.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.523
And it comes from the
process called adaptation.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.720
Almost all sensory
systems have adaptation,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.370
which means that when
you turn a stimulus on,

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:46.895
you get a vigorous response.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.560
And even though the stimulus
stays on, after a while

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.810
the response dies
down a little bit.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.085
And that process is
called adaptation.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.220
So I've illustrated the
process of adaptation

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.750
for auditory nerve fibers
in this next graph.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.920
Here's that pink
tone burst at 2,000

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.170
Hertz we were listening to.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.320
There's the auditory
nerve response to it.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.070
Right as the tone
burst goes on, there's

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.020
going to be a vigorous
discharge, which

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.870
die eyes down and
becomes a smaller-- still

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.390
a discharge, but a
smaller discharge.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.250
And that process is
called adaptation.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.000
Where do you think
that process arises?

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:35.200
OK, while you're
thinking about that,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:48.240
I'm going to draw a picture
of what's happening here.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.400
So you have the three
rows of outer hair cells.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.180
We have the inner hair cell.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.736
We have the auditory
nerve fiber.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.200
And we're recording here.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.290
And we're saying,
we turn the sound on

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.950
and you get a whole
bunch of spikes

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.070
from that single
auditory nerve fiber.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:18.190
But after a few milliseconds
or so, the response dies down.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.630
What experiment could you do?

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.750
We don't know where
that process is arising.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.310
We can't explain it.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:28.970
What experiment would you do
to study where that comes from?

00:37:31.774 --> 00:37:32.274
Anybody?

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.985
Here's the tone.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.590
Here's the response
from the nerve fiber.

00:37:50.592 --> 00:37:52.050
What do we need to
figure out where

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.670
that adaptation is taking place?

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.540
Well, how about recording
from somewhere else?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.670
What about recording
from the hair cell?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.260
OK, if you do that, the hair
cell doesn't fire spikes,

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.125
but it has a receptor potential
in response to the sound.

00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:21.445
The receptor goes
on and stays on.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.870
OK, where is adaptation
taking place?

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.130
Well, somewhere between the
hair cell and the nerve fiber.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.770
The hair cell doesn't adapt,
the nerve fiber does adapt.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.940
what could explain
adaptation then given that?

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:42.780
Anybody?

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.650
OK, what do we have here?

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.445
We have a synaptic ribbon with
lots of synaptic vesicles.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.690
The tone goes on.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.560
You have a whole bunch
of synaptic vesicles.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.362
You release them because the
hair cell has depolarized.

00:39:06.362 --> 00:39:09.020
You have a burst of
auditory nerve firing.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.500
And you can make new
synaptic vesicles, right?

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.690
Yeah, but it takes time.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.170
OK, so as time goes on,
you've released all of these

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.800
or many of them.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.210
And you can make some new ones,
but maybe not quite as fast

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.550
as you've released them.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.085
So you deplete your
synaptic vesicles.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.180
The hair cell's
still responding.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.570
There are fewer vesicles and
fewer neurotransmitter released

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.275
to the nerve and so the
nerve firing dies out.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:55.500
So adaptation is often ascribed
to the diminished release

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.476
of neurotransmitter.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.560
And so far, that's all
adaptation to a single tone.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.650
How does that explain masking?

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:21.120
Well, if your nerve fiber
responded to the noise--

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.430
at the very beginning you
heard that noise come on-- shh.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.400
And then the tone came
on a little bit later.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.530
If the tone is high
in level, sure, it's

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.900
going to still have some
synaptic vesicles to release.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.840
But if the tone is very
soft, the hair cell

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.760
is not going to be able to
release synaptic vesicles

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.426
because they've
already been released

00:40:43.426 --> 00:40:44.675
at the beginning of the noise.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.900
So adaptive masking is where
you have, to a certain extent,

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.086
run out of hair cell
neurotransmitter.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.490
And there's none, or much
less, left to release.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:05.420
Clearly, adaptive masking
means that this fiber is also

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.150
responding to the mask or
the noise in this case.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.840
So in adaptive masking
you have to have

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.660
a stimulus that excites.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:18.673
The masker has to excite the
nerve fiber and the hair cell.

00:41:18.673 --> 00:41:21.964
And the probe-- probe
is always exciting it.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.110
So that is a second
explanation for masking.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.130
Now in this case, the
olivocochlear system

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:34.020
can actually help you
with adaptive masking.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.220
How can it help you?

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.370
Well, in this
case, if you also--

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.660
when you start to
hear this noise,

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.905
you call that olivocochlear
system into play.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.260
And it acts.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.410
What does it act to do?

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.695
It decreases the firing
of the auditory nerve.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.330
Then when you have
the tone come along,

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.130
you have plenty of
neurotransmitter

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.870
left in the hair cell because
you haven't released it all.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:06.130
And you have at least
some to be released

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.670
in response to the tone.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.400
So in this case,
the third function

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.400
then of the
olivocochlear system is

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.850
to reduce the
effects of masking.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.510
And we should have
said back here

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:24.090
when I listed the functions,
reduce the effects of noise

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.220
masking, especially
adaptive noise masking.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:34.120
The kind where the masker
excites the fiber unlike

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.790
suppressive masking where the
masker reduces the response.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.370
There are certainly important
and reliable studies

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.650
where animals in which the
olivocochlear bundle has

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:55.810
been cut have much more of a
problem with noise masking.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:43:01.910
They cannot detect signals that
are buried in a noise masker

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.030
as well as animals with an
intact olivocochlear bundle.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.035
So clearly, that is
a viable function.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.670
Now finally, and this is pretty
important for our course here,

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.400
there's been this fourth idea
of what the olivocochlear

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.680
reflex could do.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.100
And it's always been a
little bit wishy-washy

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.720
because there hasn't been really
good experimental evidence.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.010
Until this paper-- this
paper Delano et al,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:37.215
2007-- is the paper that we
have listed for reading today.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.720
And this paper clearly
shows that another function

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.920
of the olivocochlear system is
when you're paying attention

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.950
to something that
is not auditory,

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:55.560
like a visual stimulus,
the olivocochlear system

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.570
acts and reduces your
sense of hearing.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:03.170
You're not using hearing
for whatever task,

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:08.090
so you desensitize your
hearing and you pay attention

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.330
to the visual system.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.860
OK, so how is this
going to work?

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.820
So this paper
trained chinchillas

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.050
as the experimental animal.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.160
And the task was to pay
attention to lights.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.010
So let me get my
pointer here so I

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.230
can point out a little better.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.890
So this is the task
in part A here.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:41.090
And this neutral cue is a
light that's straight ahead

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.720
from the experimental animal.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.820
And that goes on and
says to the animal

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.905
that the trial is starting.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:53.600
Then, that goes off and
one of two targets appears.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.950
Either a left target
or a right target.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.610
And these are little spots
of light to the animal's left

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:00.450
or to the right.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.380
The task then is if the
left target went on,

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.100
the animal goes and
presses the left lever.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.980
And if it does that correctly,
it gets a food reward.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.825
If the light went
on on the right,

00:45:16.825 --> 00:45:18.200
the right target
was illuminated,

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.200
the right lever is
supposed to be pressed.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.000
And if the animal
does that correctly,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.670
then it gets a food reward.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:29.260
If it does nothing or if
it presses the wrong lever,

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.990
it's punished by a timeout.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.810
And the animals
are food deprived,

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.320
so they're motivated
to do this task.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.590
That's the visual task.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:41.700
Now, on top of that there's
some auditory stimuli presented.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.210
And they're not
relevant to the task.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.790
They're just ongoing
all the time.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:54.500
And here then in B are the
target and the neutral cue

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.310
lights and the response period.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.850
And the auditory stimulus
going on all the time

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.411
is a click or a tone burst.

00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:02.910
And it's just going
on all the time.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.640
And they're making
some recordings

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.850
from the auditory system.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.130
And in this case, they're
making a recording

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.840
from the round window
of the cochlea.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.830
And if you had a microscope,
you could see some little blips

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:20.740
right here in response
to the clicks.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:23.225
And they're pretty big here.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.280
But as time goes on,
they get smaller.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.490
And that's plotted right here.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:33.320
The response they're
measuring is called the CAP,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.425
and that's the Compound
Action Potential.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.475
And if you are astute
here, the action potential

00:46:55.475 --> 00:46:58.330
is another word for
"spikes" or "impulses."

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:01.190
But they're not measuring
from one single fiber,

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.930
they're putting a big
electrode on the round window

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.820
of the cochlear and they're
measuring the summed

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.650
or compound action potential
from the whole auditory nerve.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.080
It's just a convenient
place to do it.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.740
You can do it in
an awake animal.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.550
You can do it in awake behaving
animal like we have here.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.290
When you turn on a click, almost
all the auditory nerve fibers

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.540
fire synchronously and
you get a big response.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.440
Hardly have to do
any averaging at all.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.855
OK, so that's the response,
the compound action potential.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.720
And this graph plots the CAP
amplitude-- how big it is.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.820
Upward on the graph
is a big amplitude

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.715
and lower is a
diminished amplitude.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.810
And right here at
zero-- they just

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.380
call it zero because
that's sort of the baseline

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.735
before the trial even starts.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.899
So in this first bar here
is the neutral OK cue.

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:03.190
That's the thing in the middle
that says to the animal,

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:04.135
the task is starting.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.640
And right away during
that neutral cue,

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.980
these black dots show you that
the compound action potential

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.695
is decreasing.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.270
Then, the neutral cue goes
off and the target-- one

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.270
of the targets goes on.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.860
Either the left or right.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.555
And the compound action
potential further decreases.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.640
Then, the animal makes
its response here

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.740
in this dashed line.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.820
OK, gets its food reward
and the CAP comes back up.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.780
OK, now how do we explain this?

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:49.340
Well, the CAP is the
summed firing rate

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.260
of many auditory nerve fibers.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.700
Instead of stimulation
of the OC neurons

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.550
decreasing the firing rate,
essentially the animal

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.670
itself has turned
on its OC neurons

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.610
and the firing
rate has gone down.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:11.755
Or the summed response, in
this case, has gone down.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:17.400
The animal has said to
the olivocochlear system,

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.630
I'm starting a visual task.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:24.970
I don't want to pay attention to
extraneous things, like sounds.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.360
So I'm going to
decrease my sensitivity

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.510
in hearing by activating
these olivocochlear neurons.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.582
Now, pay attention to
the important targets,

00:49:34.582 --> 00:49:35.290
which are visual.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.935
Now, there are some other
symbols in here that are open.

00:49:43.935 --> 00:49:46.000
They're a little
bit harder to see.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.700
But there are some
CAP amplitudes

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.505
from another trial of
these same animals.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.880
And for one reason or
another, the chinchillas

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.065
didn't always do the task.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.960
Every now and then they would
just not pay attention to it.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.210
They wouldn't press the lever.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.630
They wouldn't respond at all.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.550
As if they were
sort of spaced out,

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.060
thinking about something
else if you will.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.464
And in those cases,
which are timeout trials.

00:50:18.464 --> 00:50:19.922
Let's see, what
did they call them?

00:50:27.794 --> 00:50:28.670
Ah, omissions.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.420
This little symbol
right here is omissions.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.670
So it's an omission trial
where the animal didn't even

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.790
do the task.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.510
In that case, the
olivocochlear system

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.630
is apparently not
called into play at all.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:42.765
The animal is just
not doing the task.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:50.570
Now, the investigators were
very astute and they said,

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.630
we're going to make
the task a little more

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.930
difficult for the
animals and see

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.450
if we get a bigger effect here.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.740
And the way to make
the task difficult

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.465
is make the targets brief.

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:08.720
So instead of the target going
on for a couple of seconds,

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.130
the target went on for
just a half a second.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.005
And here's a trial with
just a half a second.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.115
And there was a big decrease
in the auditory response.

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.940
If the target went
on for a long time,

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.200
there was less of a decrease.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.000
And this is the effect plotted
as a function of target

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.750
duration.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.897
Brief targets made
this job harder

00:51:32.897 --> 00:51:33.980
to do for the chinchillas.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.290
So this is clearly,
at least to me,

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:46.310
some evidence that you call into
play the olivocochlear system

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.380
when you're doing a visual task.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.950
So maybe as humans, we do this
when we're trying to read.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.295
We're concentrating on
the book, visual stimulus.

00:51:56.295 --> 00:52:00.020
And our neighbors
music is going on.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.820
It's not relevant
to what we're doing.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.900
Maybe we're listening
to it subconsciously,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:08.490
but we decrease the response
to that auditory stimulus

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:10.455
because it's not
important to the task.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.970
So clearly then,
this is good evidence

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:21.860
from this single study
for the last function

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.850
for the olivocochlear
system, which

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:29.420
is that you reduce your hearing
sensitivity when attending

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.350
to visual or perhaps
other modality tasks.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.705
So these are the
four basic functions

00:52:35.705 --> 00:52:37.510
then for the
olivocochlear system.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.510
Now, before I leave the
olivocochlear system,

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:47.005
let's do a little review here
on exactly how it's acting.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:53.370
So we said we're activating
these systems going out

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.730
to the hair cells
and we're reducing

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:57.830
the responses of the
auditory nerve fibers.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:04.500
Something I haven't told you
but was observed maybe 20

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.030
years after the phenomenon
was first discovered

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:11.190
is the idea of which
of these systems

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.470
is being used here
when we electrically

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:17.090
stimulate the system
and activated it.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.770
It turns out that the
medial olivocochlear neurons

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.680
have big, fat myelinated axons.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.930
And you can maybe appreciate
that from this drawing

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:27.300
that these are very thick lines.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.590
The lateral olivocochlear
neurons have very thin axons.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.310
And one effect of that
besides how fast they conduct

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:42.050
impulses is when you stimulate,
for example, at this position

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:46.780
here in the brainstem, it takes
a huge amount of stimulating

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.130
current to activate
very thin nerve

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.900
fibers like the lateral
olivocochlear neurons.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.510
If you apply a huge
stimulating current here,

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.950
the current spreads
to everywhere,

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.190
including the
facial nerve, which

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:03.730
causes the experimental
animal to twitch.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:05.400
So that's almost never done.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.110
More moderate levels
of stimulation current

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:09.590
are applied here.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:13.290
And at those levels, the
predominant system activating

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.280
is the medial
olivocochlear neurons.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.680
Those MOC neurons
send their fibers out

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.875
to the outer hair cells.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.680
And we say when they
act on the outer hair

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.900
cells, the responses of
the nerve fibers diminish.

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:33.790
As we review, we should be
able to account for that.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.470
OK, we are stimulating
nerve fibers

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:55.285
that go out to the
outer hair cells here.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.720
And we're recording
the responses

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.176
from the auditory nerve
fibers right here.

00:55:14.176 --> 00:55:17.290
Of course, these
olivocochlear neurons

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:20.260
are sending messages
out to the periphery.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.480
And the auditory nerve
fibers are sending messages

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.310
into the brain.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.780
Somebody explain to me
what's happening here.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:37.590
What are we doing to the cochlea
to cause these responses to go

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:40.435
down when we apply
this simulation?

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.040
Anybody?

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.200
We're affecting the
outer hair cells, right?

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.745
What are the outer hair cells?

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.510
The cochlea amplifier, right?

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.490
It turns out that
releasing the acetylcholine

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.184
on to the outer
hair cells decreases

00:56:06.184 --> 00:56:07.100
their electromotility.

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:15.470
So in effect, it discusses the
gain of the cochlear amplifier.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:22.870
If the cochlea is
less amplified,

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.080
the inner hair cell stereocilia
are going to be bent less.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.670
They're going to release
less neurotransmitter

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.564
to the associated
auditory nerve fibers.

00:56:32.564 --> 00:56:34.480
And we're going to measure
less of a response.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.570
That is how the
olivocochlear neurons--

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:42.110
those that go to the
outer hair cells--

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:45.220
affect the responses of
the auditory nerve fiber.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:51.870
So this decrease
in firing rate then

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.630
is a manifestation
of turning down

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:56.270
the gain of the
cochlear amplifier.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.600
It was quite a mystery when
this innervation was first

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.220
worked out before the
outer hair cells really

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.670
were known to be the amplifier.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.060
How could stimulation of fibers
going to the outer hair cells

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.760
give you decreases in
responses of fibers

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.820
coming from the
inner hair cells?

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.300
And now that the outer
hair cells are clearly

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.790
associated with the cochlear
amplifier, it's clear.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:28.500
Now, what was the
loss of sensitivity

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.940
when the outer hair cells
were completely gone

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:35.450
or when their prestin
was knocked out?

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.988
Anybody?

00:57:35.988 --> 00:57:37.363
What was the loss
of sensitivity?

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.970
40 to 60 dB, right?

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:46.120
So if you eliminated
the cochlear amplifier,

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.685
we had a loss of 40 to 60 dB.

00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.790
What kind of effect do
we have from stimulation

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:02.180
of the olivocochlear neurons?

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:08.630
Well, the length of this arrow
when brought down to the x-axis

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:12.100
shows you how much
sensitivity is lost.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:17.560
You could overcome
this by dialing

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.460
in an increase of sound pressure
level to make up for it.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:25.720
You could titrate the effect
of decreasing the gain

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.480
by increasing the
sound stimulus.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.480
And the width of that arrow,
the length of that arrow,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.890
is about 25 dB.

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:42.370
So instead of eliminating
the cochlear amplifier,

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:46.511
you just reduce its gain by the
action of these olivocochlear

00:58:46.511 --> 00:58:47.010
neurons.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:49.020
The effect is about 25 dB.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:54.450
Which is a fairly strong effect,
but you're not completely

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:57.000
ridding the cochlea of
the cochlear amplifier.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.550
You're decreasing its gain.

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:06.680
OK, so that's kind of a review
on outer hair cell function

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.800
and how these olivocochlear
neurons affect the outer hair

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.300
cells.

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.080
So you really have a
controllable cochlear amplifier

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.020
controlled by these
olivocochlear neurons,

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.220
or efferent neurons,
or descending neurons

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.730
coming from the brain
out to the cochlea.

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:26.182
Any questions about that?

00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:29.470
OK.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:34.470
If there aren't, then I'll go
on to another reflex pathway.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.493
Maybe I actually do have one
more thing to talk about.

00:59:48.025 --> 00:59:48.525
Right.

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:54.710
Let me just mention this
idea that this reflex pathway

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:57.430
is kind of getting teased
out by current studies.

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:03.580
And it can be a little
bit complicated,

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.870
so let me show you
what people are working

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.750
on now in the
olivocochlear reflex.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.830
Here, I think I've
flipped the slide on you

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:16.220
so that this slide shows
the MOC neurons going

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.940
to the left cochlea.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.650
OK.

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:20.250
That's the ipsilateral cochlea.

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.960
How do these MOC neurons
get their inputs?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.230
Where do they come from?

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.390
OK.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:36.300
Well, the red and blue are
the olivocochlear neurons

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.105
coming out to the cochlea and
the purple are their inputs.

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:45.800
And all of the inputs have to,
of course, use the cochlea.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.300
To get this olivocochlear
neurons to fire in response

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.320
to sound, you have to
activate the cochlea.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.490
You activate the auditory nerve.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.030
The auditory nerve goes into
the cochlea nucleus then.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.250
And that's where the
limits of our understanding

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:05.990
are sort of-- we are
approaching the limits

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:07.250
of our understanding.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:11.750
What are the cochlear
nucleus neurons

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:15.720
that are the so-called MOC
reflex interneurons that

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.570
are drawn in purple here?

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.610
When we talked about
the cochlear nucleus,

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:23.140
we identified a bunch of
different types of neurons.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.170
We had spherical
cells, globular cells.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.110
Both of those are
known as bushy cells.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:30.515
We had stellate cells.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.710
We had pyramidal cells.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.640
We had octopus cells.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:42.080
Which of those provide the
inputs for the MOC neurons?

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.580
And that's assuming
a direct pathway,

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.530
which I'll give you from some
other experimental evidence

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:50.740
which I won't show you.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.570
At least one group
of cochlear nucleus

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:58.210
neurons projects
to the MOC neurons.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.610
And how do I know that?

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.610
Well, you can record
from the MOC neurons

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.680
and turn a sound on.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.590
And in less than 5 milliseconds,
you can get a response.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.680
So there isn't enough time
for the reflex pathway

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.620
to go up to the
auditory cortex, which

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.680
takes about 4 or 5 synapses.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.760
And to go around there
and start coming down,

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.640
that takes 10 or
20 milliseconds.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.305
You get a response
here very quickly.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.570
And so there isn't enough time,
except for cochlear nucleus

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:32.860
to project directly there.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:39.930
So which of those cochlear
nucleus neurons do project?

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:41.855
Well, we don't know
absolutely for sure.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.420
But it looks like
from lesion studies

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.960
that probably the stellate
cells in the cochlear nucleus.

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.990
And especially
the stellate cells

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:06.780
in the part of the cochlear
nucleus called the PVCN.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.940
And I think we talked
about the ventral cochlear

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.520
nucleus and the dorsal
cochlear nucleus

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.300
as being the big main divisions.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.470
In the VCN, there's two
subdivisions, AVCN and PVCN.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:26.030
And the stellate cells
that seem to be-- the MOC

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.900
reflex interneurons
are in the PVCN.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.820
How do we know that?

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:34.130
You can make lesion studies in
various parts of the cochlear

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.700
nucleus.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:39.610
If you lesion the DCN, this
reflex goes along fine.

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:42.330
If you lesion the AVCN,
it goes along fine.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.267
In the PVCN, if you
make a lesion there,

01:03:46.267 --> 01:03:47.350
the reflex is interrupted.

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:55.540
In the PVCN, there are a
number of types of neurons.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.160
The ones that seem to have the
right characteristics in terms

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.750
of latency, sustainability
of response,

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.720
tuning, are the stellate cells.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.080
So it's a little bit
of a squishy argument.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.980
Stellate cells seem to
project to the right way.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.200
So most of the evidence
is behind the idea

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.040
that those particular
cochlear nucleus

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.760
cells are the ones that are
the reflex interneurons.

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:29.300
Now, another point of this slide
is that the MOC reflex pathway

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.740
is consensually organize.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.680
So what does consensual mean?

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.790
What does consensual in
terms of reflex mean?

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.020
Not in terms of
consensual sex, in terms

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.930
of reflexes or
brainstem organization.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.270
How does the detective in the
old 1950s black and white movie

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:51.440
come to the victim
whose lying down

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.300
and shine a flashlight
in the eye-- how does he

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.130
decide that the
person is really dead?

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:04.570
The pupil constricts if the
person's still alive, right?

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.270
The brainstem is still working.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:07.860
It's a very quick test.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.450
You don't have to
have a stethoscope

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.616
and listen to the heartbeat.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.370
You can be brain dead and
still have a heartbeat.

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:17.250
But if you shine light
in a person's eye,

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.030
the pupil constricts, right?

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.014
So that is a brainstem reflects.

01:05:21.014 --> 01:05:22.430
The pupillary
constriction reflex.

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:25.640
It turns out if you shine
light in the right eye, what

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.040
happens to your left pupil?

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.150
It constricts, right.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:34.610
So both pupils constrict from
just a stimulus in one eye.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:36.620
And that is called consensual.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.300
It means in agreement.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.620
The left and the right side do
the same thing in agreement.

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.240
So most of these
brainstem reflexes

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.890
are consensually organized.

01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:51.360
And it turns out
that you can look

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.942
at the MOC reflex
in your left ear.

01:05:53.942 --> 01:05:55.650
And obviously, if you
put sound in there,

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:57.985
that reflex is
going to take place.

01:05:57.985 --> 01:06:00.210
But you can also
elicit that reflex

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.560
by sound in the right ear.

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:08.990
For some reason, sound in either
ear can activate the reflex.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:13.880
Not quite as well,
labeling studies

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.040
have shown that just
some of the MOC neurons

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.530
are responsive to sound in
the ipsilateral cochlea.

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:25.130
That is, the cochlea
that they project to.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.590
And about half as many
are responsive to sound

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:32.860
in the other ear.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.020
The so-called
contralateral cochlea

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.010
and the so-called
contra response,

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:40.810
MOC neurons in red here.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.120
Labeling studies have
shown these contra

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.600
response neurons are sitting
on the side of the brain

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.160
as the cochlea that
they innervate.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.950
But the ipsi
response neurons are

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:58.090
located on the opposite side
of the brain [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:04.560
And knowing those
response characteristics,

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.440
then you can draw
the purple pathway

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.000
that's necessary to drive them.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.140
These contra response neurons
respond to sound over here,

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.925
so they must get
this purple arrow.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.070
These ipsi response neurons
are responsive to sound here,

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:25.970
so they must get
this purple pathway.

01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:33.100
And it's kind of complicated,
but that's the kind of studies

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.460
that people do now on
these brainstem reflexes.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.020
And I want to just
say one more thing.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.345
People are now working on where
the neurons go in the cochlea.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:52.230
So these are some tuning
curves from these MOC neurons.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:55.290
So they show sharp tuning
just like the auditory nerve.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.380
And where do they go?

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:05.130
Well, they have a very nice
so-called tonotopic projection

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:06.740
into the cochlea.

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:12.840
That is, an MOC
neuron with a high CF

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.365
goes and innervates at a
very basal cochlear location.

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:18.830
and.

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:23.479
An MOC neuron with a low CF
goes and innervates closer

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:24.195
to the apex.

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:30.550
And this black line
shows the mapping

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.524
for auditory nerve fibers.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.399
Those are the ones coming
out of the cochlea.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.149
And the colored dots
show the mapping

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:40.450
for the fibers going
back on to the cochlea.

01:08:44.396 --> 01:08:46.229
Everything, remember,
in the auditory system

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.060
is tonotopically organized.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:52.560
So it's no surprise
that that would happen.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.790
But it opens up the idea
maybe that if you're

01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:01.160
interested in turning off
your sense of hearing just

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.880
for low frequencies, you
could activate these fibers,

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.560
go out to the cochlea
in just the apical part,

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.200
and leave the basal part.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.109
Let's say you're very
interested in listening

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.250
to high-frequency sounds.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.000
Leave the basal part intact.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.069
Or vice-versa.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:22.640
You could control the
cochlea in a frequency band

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.910
by frequency band manner.

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:28.700
The anatomical
substrate there is

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.939
laid for that type
of manipulation.

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:33.456
You don't have to shut down
the whole sense of hearing.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.689
OK, so let's move on
to the second system

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:44.830
that I want to talk about.

01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:50.660
That is, the brainstem reflexes
associated with the stapedius

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.830
and tenser tympani
middle-ear muscles.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.280
These are two muscles that
are in the middle ear.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.040
Remember the middle ear was
the part of the ear that

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.915
starts at the eardrum
and ends at the cochlea?

01:10:08.506 --> 01:10:09.880
There are two
middle ear muscles.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.160
There's a tensor tympani.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.890
This is shaded in brown here.

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.380
And there's the stapedius
shaded in red here.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.810
The stapedius tugs
on the stapes.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.650
And the tensor tympani
tugs on the malleus.

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:29.805
But it gets its name
because when it contracts,

01:10:29.805 --> 01:10:32.380
it looks like-- if you're
looking at the eardrum

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.670
through an otoscope, it looks
like the tympanic membrane gets

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:36.295
really tense.

01:10:36.295 --> 01:10:39.300
It looks a little flaccid
before it contracts,

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.930
and then it gets real tense.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.360
So it's a tensor tympani.

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:48.163
And what happens when
those muscles contract?

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.840
That's shown in this next slide.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.340
They reduce the
sound transmission

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.690
through the middle ear.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:01.700
This is just simply a
graph on contraction

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.290
of the stapedius muscle.

01:11:07.175 --> 01:11:08.466
This is during the contraction.

01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:11.430
This is the magnitude change.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:17.760
So it looks like sound doesn't
get through the middle ear

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.200
anywhere near as
well as normally.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.545
And you have about a 25 dB
decrease in sensitivity.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:30.630
Simply what that means is
that usually the eardrum moves

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:33.680
and these bones move and they
convey efficiently the sound

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.210
into the inner ear.

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:39.610
But if you tug on the
muscles and contract them,

01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:42.260
then the bones don't
vibrate as easily.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.730
And the sound doesn't
get into the inner ear.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:48.800
So this is again, like
the olivocochlear system,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.510
an inhibitory system in
that when it's activated

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.327
it reduces your
sensitivity of hearing.

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:04.000
Now, how are these
muscles controlled?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.630
Well, they're controlled by
neurons coming from the brain.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:10.950
But in the case of
muscles, of course,

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.110
they're always on the
same side of the brain

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:14.360
as the muscles they innervate.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.880
So the left stapedius muscle
is controlled by motor neurons

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.300
on the left side of your brain.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.490
And the stapedius
muscle motor neurons

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:27.870
run in the seventh
cranial nerve.

01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:34.650
And what's the
seventh cranial nerve?

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.150
Anybody?

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:47.190
We have the eighth cranial nerve
is auditory and vestibular.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:52.975
What's the seventh?

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.292
Anybody?

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:58.000
AUDIENCE: Facial.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.041
PROFESSOR: Facial, right.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:13.400
So the stapedius axons
go in that cranial nerve.

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:18.060
The stapedius motor
neuron axons, should say.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:28.760
And for the tensor tympani,
it's the fifth cranial nerve.

01:13:35.564 --> 01:13:36.536
Tensor tympani.

01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:49.310
So some very
interesting experiments

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.250
have been done in
people who have

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:56.380
a compromise of their
seventh cranial nerve.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.840
Does anybody know
what Bell's palsy is?

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.220
Does anybody know
what a palsy is?

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:11.934
Palsy means your motor neurons
aren't working so well.

01:14:11.934 --> 01:14:12.600
So what happens?

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.630
In Bell's palsy, the
seventh cranial nerve

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:18.415
innervates facial musculature.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.990
So if you have a problem,
a cut seventh nerve

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.780
or a Bell's palsy, which
is a viral infection

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.810
of the seventh cranial
nerve on one side, one

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:33.180
side of your facial features
droop because the muscles

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:37.920
there, which ordinary keep
your muscles in good control

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.430
of your face, they're
not working anymore.

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.220
So a person with a Bell's palsy
has a droopy face on that side.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.060
The other side is fine because
the other seventh cranial

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.360
nerve is working just fine.

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:52.830
Or it usually is.

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.615
It's very often the case
that it's unilateral.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.310
In Scandinavia where you can
do experiments on humans,

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:07.940
or you could at least
do experiments on humans

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:12.770
to a much greater extent than
in the United States, what

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:15.430
some enterprising
researchers did was

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:19.510
they took people who had
Bell's palsy and they said,

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:23.480
well, you can go and
work in your ordinary job

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.515
in the automobile factory
where it's really loud.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:32.140
They tested their hearing
before they went to work

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.680
and they tested their hearing
at the end of the work day.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.410
They tested it in the left
ear and in the right ear.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:40.370
Let's say the right ear
was the palsied ear.

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:46.030
And then, left ear,
which was normal,

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.100
person came out at
the end of the workday

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.520
and their hearing
was just right.

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.840
In the palsied side,
at the end of the day

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.800
they had a temporary
threshold shift.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.050
That means that if they're
hearing was down at 0 dB

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.800
at the beginning of the
day, their thresholds

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.890
were elevated at
the end of the day.

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.930
And hopefully, it's temporary.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.390
That is, if you sleep all
night and things recover,

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:12.116
you're back to
normal the next day.

01:16:12.116 --> 01:16:14.910
But what had happened-- this
is a beautiful experiment

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:17.320
because it's
controlled-- left-right

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.680
in the same individual.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:23.190
So whatever that person did--
took drugs, or got infections,

01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:25.480
or whatever-- was
hopefully bilateral.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.700
It's a human, so you
can test very well

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.450
thresholds of hearing.

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:34.130
Presumably then, the
stapedius muscle,

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:38.320
which was not working
on the palsied side,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.620
couldn't protect the
ear from the high levels

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.690
of sound in the
work environment.

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:44.510
And there was
damage-- hopefully,

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.390
temporary-- to that
person's hearing.

01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:51.630
So clearly, the contraction
of these muscles,

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:56.100
which makes sound not go
through the middle ear as well,

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.990
is of beneficial effect.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:02.970
For example, they protect
the cochlea from damage.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.890
People who are at the NFL games
are having their middle ear

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:09.940
muscles contract.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.097
Certainly, the stapedius.

01:17:11.097 --> 01:17:12.430
And probably the tensor tympani.

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:18.940
They probably reduce the
effects of noise masking.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:23.330
So that is a little
twist here in terms

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:26.530
of the spectrum of
where these muscles act.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:31.170
It turns out when the muscles
contract, both the stapedius

01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:35.310
and the tensor tympani,
they affect low frequencies

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:37.400
to a much greater
extent than highs.

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:43.190
For example, here you have
a reduction in transmission

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:46.330
through the middle ear of 25
dB at the lowest frequency

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:49.845
and 0, or even actually,
improved transmission

01:17:49.845 --> 01:17:50.845
at the high frequencies.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:55.940
And if you've ever been in
a car and you accelerate

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.540
to go on the highway,
you know the low rumbling

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.010
of the sound of the car means
you have to turn the radio up

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:05.970
when you want to enjoy your
music because the low rumbling

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:08.390
of the car, these
low frequencies

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.030
tend to mask the
interesting high frequencies

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.985
or mid-frequencies of
the music that you're

01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:14.360
trying to listen
to on the radio.

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:20.840
So low frequencies tend to mask
mid and highs very effectively.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.640
And so if you decrease
the transmission

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.430
for the low
frequencies, you reduce

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:26.690
the effects of noise masking.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.235
Especially by
low-frequency noises.

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:34.900
Now finally, an
interesting thing

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:38.490
that is clearly known for
the middle ear muscles

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:42.040
is that they
contract just before

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.120
and during when you speak.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.719
During you speak, OK?

01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:46.885
I don't know who wrote that.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.770
But anyway, when I speak,
I'm contracting my middle ear

01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:51.280
muscles.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.870
And the idea there is
perhaps when you're speaking,

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:57.720
you don't want to
listen to yourself.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.610
And if you're speaking in
a loud voice, like 80 dB,

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.830
I'm trying to project here.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:07.490
Or if I'm yelling at
some family members,

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:12.890
I want to not decrease my
sense of hearing or damage it.

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:14.954
So I contract my own
middle ear muscles

01:19:14.954 --> 01:19:16.120
to prevent self-stimulation.

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:21.940
After I finish my
speaking or vocalization,

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:26.920
my muscles then stop
their contraction,

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.010
going back to normal.

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.570
And then my sense of
hearing is very acute

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:33.950
because it hasn't been damaged
by my own vocalization.

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.320
And later on in
the course, when we

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.260
talk about echolocation in bats.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.490
So bats send out
this pulse of sound,

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:45.580
which is their vocalization.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.530
And they listen for an echo.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:49.540
The pulse of sound
can be 120 dB.

01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:55.350
They're really screaming because
their targets, the insects

01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:57.910
that they hunt, are
very, very small.

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:59.940
And there's not much
physical surface

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:01.490
for that to reflect off.

01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:05.190
So the reflecting
sound is very small.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.730
And so they maximize
that reflection

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:12.300
by emitting a very
high-level acoustic pulse.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.550
And they don't want to damage
or desensitize their hearing

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:20.370
because they're listening
to very soft reflections

01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.670
from the echoes.

01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:25.460
So bats clearly tense their
middle ear muscles right

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.480
before they make this
echo-locating pulse.

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:33.970
We don't know if that's the case
for the olivocochlear neurons.

01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:36.380
It just hasn't
been investigated.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:41.200
It's very hard to measure their
effects during vocalizations.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.340
But perhaps they do.

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.014
Certainly, the middle
ear muscles do.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.267
OK, that's all I wanted to say
so we're sort of out of time.

01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:54.850
Any questions?

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.390
And I want to make
one announcement

01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:00.602
about Wednesday's class.

01:21:00.602 --> 01:21:02.060
So in Wednesday's
class we're going

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:05.510
to be talking about
sound localization,

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:10.030
and listening to sounds that
differ in intraural timing

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.550
and level difference.

01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:14.640
And so the usual
demonstrations that I play

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.430
aren't going to work
very well because we

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.040
want to manipulate
just one of those cues.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.160
So we're going to be
listening in headphones.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.290
So I have some great demos.

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:28.130
So please, if you can, bring
some headphones or earbuds.

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:31.370
And maybe download the demos
from the course website.

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:35.710
I have a few players that I
can also circulate around.

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:38.860
But if some people have
these demos on their laptops,

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.570
that would be more convenient.

01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:41.170
OK?

01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:43.320
See you on Wednesday.

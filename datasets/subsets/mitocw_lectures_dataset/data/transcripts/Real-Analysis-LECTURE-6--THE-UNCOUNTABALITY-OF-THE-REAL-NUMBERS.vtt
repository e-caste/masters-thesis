CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So
we ended last time

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.127 align:middle line:84%
with these elementary
properties that you

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:19.605 align:middle line:90%
know about the absolute value.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So let me prove one more theorem
about the absolute value, which

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe you didn't
cover in calculus.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's of
fundamental importance

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in real analysis, which is
the triangle inequality, which

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
states that for all xy in R,
the absolute value of x plus y

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
the absolute value of x

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:90%
plus the absolute value of y.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So why is it called the
triangle inequality?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me-- instead of
x and y being real numbers,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:90%
let's think of these as vectors.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So there's x.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's say y.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.275 align:middle line:84%
And then vector x
plus y is this side.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Then what this is stating
is that the length

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
of one of these sides
of this triangle

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to the sum of the two

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.863 align:middle line:84%
sides, the sum of the lengths
of the other two sides

00:01:55.863 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:90%
of the triangle.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's called
the triangle inequality.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the proof is
not very difficult,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:84%
although this
inequality is probably

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the three most
useful things you'll

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
learn in this class if you go
on to study more analysis--

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:90%
the other one being--

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I'm coming--

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
this is knowledge from PDE.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I'm viewing it
through that lens of what

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
I find useful in PDEs.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But triangle inequality,
integration by parts,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
change of variables, those
three power the analysis machine

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that I'm most familiar with.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So how to prove the
triangle inequality--

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
if x and y is an R, then
clearly, by property number 6,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
the x is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
of x and y is less than or equal
to the absolute value of y.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So their sum is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:90%
of x plus y.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I can
replace x by minus x and I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
get minus x plus
minus y, this is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to the
absolute value of minus x

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
plus the absolute
value of minus y.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.185 align:middle line:84%
But this is just absolute
value of x plus y.

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And both of these
therefore imply--

00:03:48.430 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
so if I just take this and
multiply through by minus 1,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
this inequality,
which, by number 5

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
in the properties that we
proved, for the absolute value

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
implies that the absolute
value of x plus y is less than

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
absolute value of x

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:90%
plus the absolute value of y.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make a remark
about the reverse triangle

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Inequality, which will make an
appearance in your assignment.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this involves the
absolute value of x minus y

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and the absolute value
of the difference

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
in the absolute values.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is it reverse?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.965 align:middle line:90%
Because the inequality reverses.

00:04:54.965 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The absolute value of x minus
the absolute value and y,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
take the absolute value.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to the absolute value

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of x minus y.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And you'll prove this
in the assignment.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So these two-- so this follows
from the triangle inequality.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.522 align:middle line:84%
But these two inequalities
get used quite a bit.

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use them quite a
bit throughout the course.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let me take
a minute to reconnect R

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
with what you know and love
from calculus, namely decimals.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
use this fact about R

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to answer a natural
question that maybe you're

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
asking yourself, which
is the following.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So let me raise
this as a question.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So this first part
is not the question.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We've already addressed this in
the first assignment, the fact

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
that the rationals is countable.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you did it for
the positive rationals.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But if the positive
rationals are countable,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
you can then prove that all
rationals are countable.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.663 align:middle line:84%
And a natural question--
is R countable?

00:06:33.663 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Or is the set of real
numbers countable?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:90%
So in the end--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to leave
you in suspense--

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:90%
the answer is no.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.532 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to prove this.

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:53.865 align:middle line:84%
But let me just make a few
remarks about what this says.

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's the following.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So if Q-- so this is
not a proof of this.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to make a
remark based on this answer.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So since R is uncountable
and Q is countable,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
this implies that R takeaway Q,
the set of irrational numbers,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, uncountable.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to say
in words why this is true.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So suppose otherwise that
both the rational numbers

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and the irrationals
are countable.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you can map in
a bijective fashion

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
the rationals to the natural
numbers and the irrationals

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
also to the natural numbers.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
But then you can map those
natural numbers to 0, minus 1,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:90%
minus 2, minus 3, and so on.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So then you find that
there is a bijection

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
from Q to the natural
numbers and the irrationals

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to the integers less
than or equal to 0.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there's bijection
from R to the integers.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But the integers are countable,
which would contradict the fact

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
that R is uncountable.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the set of
irrationals is uncountable.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So in short, if you
didn't follow that,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
the set of irrationals
is uncountable

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise this would
force R to be countable.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.328 align:middle line:84%
Now, I haven't proved yet
that R is uncountable.

00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that in just a minute.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use a theorem about
decimal expansions for--

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.105 align:middle line:84%
or decimal representations
of real numbers.

00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So now, connecting
rationals and irrationals

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to what you've seen
since you were small,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
so to decimals, we simply--

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
we typically-- we think
of rational numbers

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
as in terms of decimal
representations.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That means we take--

00:09:49.030 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
if x is in Q, then we'll write x
as some number times some digit

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
times 10 to the k plus 10
to the k minus 1 plus d0.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to the
tenths spot, so d to the--

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
d minus 1 10 to
the minus 1 plus--

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:90%
so this is discussion.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not stating any
theorems right now,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
until we get down to maybe
some last decimal spot.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And with these digits,
a subset of 0, 1, 9.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So all I'm saying is typically
we think of x as this way.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we write x as dk, dk
minus 1, d minus 1, d minus 2,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm using this notation
because I'm going to be--

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
this is the notation I
need to state the theorem

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:90%
about the real numbers.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's quite silly that
I'm about to write this down

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in this setting.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to MIT.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So for example, 1
times 10 plus 1 times

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.185 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 0 plus 1
times 10 to the minus 1.

00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to represent
the number 11.1, which

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:90%
is the rational number.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It's quite funny that I had to
think about that for a minute

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
to go from the decimal expansion
to the rational numbers.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But don't give me
too hard of a time.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.695 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of at least
pure math, we typically

00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
write things in
rational numbers.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't write in decimal--

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had to write in
decimal expansion in quite

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
some time.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, now, of course,
not all rational numbers

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
can be written as a
finite decimal expansion.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, 1/3
you have to write

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:90%
as 0.33333 and so on and so on.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's not necessarily
covered under the discussion

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:90%
that I have right here.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But it will be
covered in what I'm

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
about to say for
the real numbers.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:90%
So we could cover 1/3.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we can also
cover every real number

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
if we allow infinite
decimal representations.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'll use the word decimal
expansions or decimal

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
representations
interchangeably there.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.538 align:middle line:90%
So let me make a definition.

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
state is about real numbers

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
between 0 and 1.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you want to
talk about real numbers

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
bigger than 1, then you
just tack on 1 to the--

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.285 align:middle line:90%
if you like, to the d0 place.

00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So the infinite part is
having to deal with what

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
comes after the decimal point.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So the let me make
the following.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
rigorous definition.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Let x in 0, 1 excluding 0.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:16.201 align:middle line:84%
And let d minus j
be in 0, 1 to 9.

00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:24.767 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:90%
for j, a natural number.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So we say x is--

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
so what does it
mean to say that x

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is given by an infinite
decimal expansion

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or given by an infinite
decimal representation?

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We say x is represented
by the digits.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And we write x is equal to d
minus 1, d minus 2, d minus 3.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
If-- so this is the
precise meaning of this.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.955 align:middle line:84%
If x is equal to the
supremum of the set--

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
so I take a finite
decimal expansion.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And then so I get a number
for each n, a natural number.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is just d
minus 1 10 to the minus 1.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And then for n equals 2, I
tack on next hundredths place,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and then the thousandths place.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I get a set
of real numbers.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
If I take its
supremum and I get x,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
then I say that x is represented
by these digits or that x--

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
or that this gives a
decimal representation of x.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:25.075 align:middle line:84%
So that you see this lines
up with what you know,

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
if I look at 0.250000, remember
this is now the sup of what?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Of a certain set.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:90%
So let me do first this guy.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
So this is 2/10.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And then now, I add the
hundredths place plus 5/100,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and then 2/10 plus 5/100--
this is a set, remember--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:90%
plus 0/1000 over plus--

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and at each next
guy, I'm supposed

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
to take this and
add on another 0.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So as a set, this is just a
set containing two elements,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:90%
namely 2/10 and 25/100.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
bigger than that guy.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So the supremum is
25/100, which equals 1/4.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all of that
to tell you that,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:90%
yes, this definition should--

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
or at least does
ring true with what

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
you were taught, that 1/4
is equal to 0.25, all right?

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.715 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that what we're done
with the triangle inequality,

00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:57.715 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to erase this.

00:17:57.715 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
last bit of discussion

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.693 align:middle line:84%
about the elementary
properties of the real numbers.

00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:42.985 align:middle line:84%
Next, we'll be talking about
sequences of real numbers.

00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all right, so I
have this definition.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental theorem
about the real numbers

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is that every real number, at
least in this setting between 0

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and 1, can be represented
by a set of digits

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
or it has a decimal
representation.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And every decimal-- if you
like, every set of digits

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to a
decimal representation

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:90%
of a real number.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So let me state the
second thing I said first.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So for every set of digits d
minus j with each of these d

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
minus j's in 0 up
to 9, then there

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
exists a unique x in
closed interval 0, 1 such

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%
that x is equal to d minus 1--

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
with this decimal
representation.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So you give me some
digits and I can

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
find a unique real
number that has

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
that decimal representation.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, before I state the
second part of the theorem,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:84%
this says that I
give you digits,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I get a unique real number.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you ask about
the other direction.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
If I have a real number, do
I get a unique set of digits?

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that is
not true necessarily

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
because, for example, 1/2, this
is equal to 0.500 and so on.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is also equal
to 0.4999 and so on.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So yes, every set of digits
gives me a unique real number.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I gave you
these digits, they

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:90%
would spit out 1/2 and only 1/2.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't spit out 1/4.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you give
me a real number,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
there does not necessarily
exist a unique set

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
of digits giving a decimal
expansion for that number.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So I can have two different
decimal expansions.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.745 align:middle line:90%
I have 0.5 and I have 0.4999.

00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I will always have at
least one, but it's not

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:90%
necessarily unique.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But we can single
out one unique choice

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
by requiring that, in some
sense, if I were to truncate

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
it, then the decimal expansion
would be less than the number

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at and
wanting to expand.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second
part of this theorem,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is that for every x in
0, 1, now excluding 0,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:90%
there exists unique digits--

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and as before, these
are in 0 up to 9--

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
such that x is--

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
such that these give a
decimal representation of x.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what singles out a
choice if we're ever coming up

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:90%
against these two things?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:17.128 align:middle line:84%
And if I truncate the
decimal expansion--

00:23:17.128 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going to
write zeros after that.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to truncate
it-- this always is less than x

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:31.635 align:middle line:84%
and this is less than or equal
to plus 10 to the minus n.

00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this
inequality will always hold.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, so this
inequality will always hold.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, x is
always bigger than

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
or equal to this
side, no matter what.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
If x is given by a
decimal representation,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%
so we always have these two.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a less than
or equal to and this

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:90%
is a less than or equal to.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But we single out
a unique choice

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of decimal representation
by choosing

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:90%
this to be a strict less than.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So then that forces us to
choose this guy over this guy.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So for theorem 2, this would say
that the unique representation

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that satisfies this for
1/2 is given by 0.4999.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And for example, for
1 would be just 0.9999

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
because if I take this
representation and cut it off,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:84%
this is actually equal to
1/2 and not less than 1/2.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that was a lot of
discussion about the theorem.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But that was for a reason
because I'm not actually

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:90%
going to prove this theorem.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not entirely
difficult. It just uses

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the least upper bound
property of the real numbers.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
clunky to write down.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd rather do
is just use this theorem

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to prove my answer, the
answer to my question

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
up there, on whether R
is accountable or not.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
In the textbook,
there is a proof

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:84%
of this theorem,
which you can read.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're actually
going to use this theorem

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to prove the following
theorem due to Cantor.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So we just went from absolute
values, which maybe it was not

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:84%
too shock and awe, now to this
theorem, which to me is shock

00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and awe, is the following,
that the interval 0, 1 is

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:90%
uncountable.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, so maybe
you're asking yourself,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
well, that's showing
this is uncountable.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's saying
R is uncountable.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So where do we go
from this to that?

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll let you
think about that.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume
this was uncountable

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and R was countable.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to say
this, say why out loud.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:84%
If this was uncountable
and R was countable,

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
then since this is a subset
of R, that means this under

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:90%
would be--

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:90%
so let me just write.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:08.592 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Why does this imply--

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give
you a fake proof,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.078 align:middle line:84%
but you can actually make
this completely rigorous--

00:27:22.078 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
fake proof in the
sense that I'm just

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
going to write symbols
that imply this.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So why is R uncountable
then if this is uncountable?

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the function that
takes an element in here

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
just into R, this is
clearly bijective.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:84%
so just the identity map from
0, 1 into R is an injective map.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So I clearly have that the
cardinality of this set

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to the cardinality of R.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe you
can think about it.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll put it
on the assignment.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, one can prove
they have the same cardinality.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
But I have that.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is uncountable.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, its
cardinality is bigger

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:90%
than the natural numbers.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So this should imply
that cardinality

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers is less
than the cardinality of R.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
R is uncountable.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's prove
this theorem due to Cantor.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this other
theorem due to Cantor,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.428 align:middle line:84%
that the cardinality
of the power set

00:28:48.428 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than the
cardinality of the set--

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was--

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
at least the proof,
the first time

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I saw it, that was
some crazy shit.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is also going to be
some pretty crazy and clever

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:90%
shit, too.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's referred to
as Cantor's diagonalization

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.432 align:middle line:90%
argument or diagonal argument.

00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's the following.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.307 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove
this by contradiction.

00:29:17.307 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.613 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to assume
that this is countable.

00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:27.530 align:middle line:90%
So it can't be finite.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
There's infinitely many
of the elements in here.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:41.082 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that, in fact,
it has the cardinality

00:29:41.082 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:90%
of the natural numbers.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to arrive
at a contradiction.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So then there exists
a function, which

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call x,
from natural numbers

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:90%
into 0, 1, which is bijective.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, so let me label
this inequality star.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
For each n, we write x of n.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is an element of 0, 1.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:90%
So this is bijective.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So every element in
0 gets mapped onto.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So we write x of n to be in
its decimal representation.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I have two indices now-- one
for the digit place and the one

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.605 align:middle line:90%
for which--

00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.052 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:31:10.052 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
At least I sheltered
you from that sneeze

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
by putting my hand
over the microphone.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Is the microphone still on?

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for each n, we write
each x of n in its decimal

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:90%
representation, satisfying star.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So each x in here can
be written uniquely

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in a given decimal
representation satisfying

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:90%
this inequality here.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:57.610 align:middle line:84%
going to come up with a real
number in the interval 0, 1

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
which x does not map to,
which therefore contradicts

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:90%
the fact that x is surjective.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And bijective surjective
means that everything

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:90%
has to get mapped onto.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the onto part.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Injective means it
maps different things

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:90%
to different things.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So what's the idea of
finding this element that

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't get mapped onto?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So let me write down just a few
of these decimal expansions.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And I may not want
to do a fourth one.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I do.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.698 align:middle line:90%
So this is, again, discussion.

00:33:10.698 --> 00:33:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put
this in brackets,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.823 align:middle line:84%
meaning this is not
part of the proof,

00:33:13.823 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:84%
but this is part of the
idea of what's going on.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And where's the diagonal part?

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so and this should go
off in this direction .

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And the decimal expansion is
marked off in that direction.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And so somehow, this list, if
it kept going in that direction,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
would have to contain every
real number between 0 and 1.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what's the idea to come
up with a real number between 0

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and one that is not in
this list is we go down

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
the diagonal of the
decimal expansions

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and we change each decimal to
something else than what it is.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore-- and
then I take my element y.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we're trying to
find a y not in this list.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take
y to be the real number

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that I get by changing each
of these decimal digits.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine if
y somehow popped up--

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:84%
let's say it popped up, since
I don't want to write anymore,

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:84%
as x4, then somehow
this number would

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:01.820 align:middle line:84%
have to be the digit
for y, but I changed it.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
not the digit of y.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's it in a nutshell.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't get
that, that's fine.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Let me now write
out the details.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit simpler
to imagine if, let's say,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:90%
all of these were 0's and 1's.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being base
10, now it's base 2.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And so instead of--

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
if the digit was the 0,
I've flipped it to 1.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
that if y did--

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.590 align:middle line:84%
so and then I form y
by flipping the digits.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So if this was 0, 0, 1, 1, then
y would start off 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if y appeared,
say, fourth in line,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be 1
and 0 in the same spot

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.540 align:middle line:84%
just by how I've constructed
y by flipping it.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, y
can't be in that list.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this map
cannot be surjective,

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:90%
which is our contradiction.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So let me make
this more precise.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Let ej-- this is going to be 1.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If the j-th digit
of the j-th x of j

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
does not equal 1;
2, if the j-th digit

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
of the j-th guy in that list,
or x of j, does equal 1.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
By part 1 of the theorem,
previous theorem,

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
there exists the unique
y in 0, 1 without 0--

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Because some of these
digits are non-zero.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It's always either 1 or 2--

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.875 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
such that y is equal to e
minus 1, e minus 2, and so on.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So moreover, since all of
these digits are either 1 or 2,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:90%
they are certainly non-zero.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So y is given by a decimal
expansion where all

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:90%
of these things are non-zero.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So that means that for
all n, a natural number,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
if I take a finite decimal
expansion-- so I cut this

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.070 align:middle line:84%
off at e to the minus n--
since e to the e minus n

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 is either 1 or 2,
that's going to be positive.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's less than y.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is always
the case, that this

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So because all these
digits are positive,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.870 align:middle line:84%
if I cut it off,
if I truncate it,

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:84%
then that number is
going to be less than y

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
because I'm missing stuff
out in the millionths place

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
or whatever each
time for each n.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
decimal expansion

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is the unique decimal
representation

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
from part 2 of the
theorem that I stated.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Every element in 0, 1 has
a unique representation,

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:90%
satisfying that inequality.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these digits
are positive, this, in fact,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is a unique representation
of this element

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.410 align:middle line:84%
y, which I've constructed by
flipping digits from this map.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, since x is
surjective, there

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:90%
exists an n, natural number--

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:84%
this n has nothing
to do with that n.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll use a
different letter, m--

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:90%
such that y equals x of m.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Then let's say I look
at e to the minus m.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.976 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So then this says
that the m-th digit,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
which should be giving me e
to the minus m because this is

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:90%
equal to --

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:84%
this, remember, is equal to
1 if dm 2 if dm equals 1.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.915 align:middle line:84%
In particular, this
does not equal dm.

00:41:18.915 --> 00:41:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:27.885 align:middle line:84%
So I have proven that this
number does not equal itself.

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.310 align:middle line:90%
All right, I can never if--

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I can never have
this number, whatever

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
it is, equal to this thing
because I'm always changing it.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:84%
If this thing is 1,
then this number is 2.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.917 align:middle line:84%
If this number is not 1,
then this number is 1.

00:41:49.917 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
not equal to that.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.276 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.276 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is a contradiction.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it shows that
this set is uncountable.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So I hope I explained
that well enough.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You can also look in the
textbook for an explanation

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.045 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you can
ask me in office hours

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.480 align:middle line:90%
for more explanation.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.462 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.462 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me fuel up real quick.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.595 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we're moving
onto a new chapter.

00:42:48.595 --> 00:42:56.717 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:57.675 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get to--

00:42:57.675 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
now, we're going to get
to the analysis part.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So analysis as I've said
before, is the study of limits.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Real analysis is the
study of limits that

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:90%
has to deal with real numbers.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to our
first notion of a limit.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.915 align:middle line:84%
And that is the limit of a
sequence of real numbers.

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're moving onto
sequences and series.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
precise definition

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.145 align:middle line:90%
of a sequence of real numbers?

00:43:41.145 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.040 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:84%
A sequence of real
numbers is precisely

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
a function x from
the natural numbers

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:90%
into R, just a function.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be bijective,
surjective, injective,

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.770 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just a function from
the natural numbers to R.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's precisely what a
sequence of real numbers is.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, we typically don't think
of a sequence as a function.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't even
use that notation.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We denote x of n by x
sub n and the associated

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:51.900 align:middle line:84%
sequence by this curly brackets,
n equals 1 to infinity.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Or we might not even write the
n equals 1 to infinity part

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.470 align:middle line:90%
or just start listing them.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let me
quickly say that although--

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:84%
so again, a sequence,
unambiguously defined,

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:84%
is a function from the
natural numbers to real.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So don't confuse
this with a set.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.850 align:middle line:90%
A sequence is not a set.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So think of a sequence,
even though again it's

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:40.720 align:middle line:84%
defined as a function, as
just an infinite listing

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.330 align:middle line:90%
of elements of R--

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:84%
one element, the first
element, the second element,

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:90%
the third element, and so on.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
to be different.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So for example, 1, 1, 1, 1, that
is a perfectly good sequence.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what
is the function,

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:84%
this is x of n
equals 1 for all n.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But again, I will not
think of really a sequence

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:90%
as a function.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Just as we never thought about
functions as subsets of--

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:23.350 align:middle line:84%
as certain subsets of the
Cartesian product of two sets,

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:30.095 align:middle line:84%
you should really think of these
as just a list of real numbers.

00:46:30.095 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we refer to
them, we'll either

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.360 align:middle line:84%
write them like that
or with curly brackets

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.568 align:middle line:84%
around an expression
for x sub n.

00:46:37.568 --> 00:46:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.755 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I
were to write this,

00:46:48.755 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
this means this is the sequence
given by 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5,

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So here's another definition.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So a sequence is bounded
if, in some sense,

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.180 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't run off to
arbitrarily large values.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So sequence x sub n is
bounded if there exists

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.760 align:middle line:84%
some real number b
bigger than or equal

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to 0 such that for all n
in the natural numbers xn

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.900 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to b in absolute value.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, for example, if
we take a look back at both

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:90%
of those two sequences--

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
1, 1, 1, and the
sequence 1 over n--

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.970 align:middle line:90%
these are bounded.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Because every element in this--

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say element, but
every entry in this sequence

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.140 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 1.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's bounded by 1.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And every entry in this sequence
is less than or equal to 1.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's bounded by
1 in absolute value.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It's also positive.

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:90%
So they're both bounded.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Another example is the
sequence minus 1 to the n.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'll write equals,
although this shouldn't-- this

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.530 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean anything.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to write it--

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:84%
write it-- or start listing
the entries-- minus 1,

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.280 align:middle line:90%
1, minus 1, 1, minus 1, 1.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This is also bounded because
the absolute value of minus 1

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.830 align:middle line:90%
to the n is 1.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's bounded
by 1 for all n.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So what's a non-example?

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The sequence n-- in
other words, this

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is the sequence 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and so on.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, precisely why is it un--
so I should say this is bounded.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, I'll refer to x
sub n as unbounded, unbounded.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:90%
So why is it unbounded?

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the entries are getting
larger and larger in size.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to ask
you to prove this,

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.020 align:middle line:90%
you would have to show--

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is also a
good first exercise--

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean
to be unbounded.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So I said this at one
point, that if you

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.290 align:middle line:84%
come across a reasonably
interesting definition,

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:84%
you should look up or try
to come up with examples.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And typically, when you
do come up with examples,

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:84%
you should come up
with non-examples.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And what that requires you to
do is negate the definition.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.420 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean for
something to not be that?

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm saying
that if it's not bounded

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I call it unbounded,
I haven't actually

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:43.750 align:middle line:84%
written a mathematical
statement to this effect

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:90%
on what this means.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me make this
right here as a remark.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So a sequence is
unbounded, so if it doesn't

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.070 align:middle line:90%
satisfy that definition.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So we need to negate
this definition.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.910 align:middle line:84%
The definition says
this is bounded

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:09.450 align:middle line:84%
if there exists a b bigger
than or equal to 0 such

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:90%
that this holds for all n.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I negate a there
exists, that becomes a for all.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I negate a for all,
that becomes a there exists.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I negate
this condition.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence is unbounded
if for all b bigger than

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0 there exists
a natural number in n

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.840 align:middle line:84%
such that xn in absolute
value is bigger than b.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, using this-- so
this is-- if you like,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.630 align:middle line:84%
you can take that as
a second definition.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not really a definition,
since it's just the negation

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.160 align:middle line:90%
of the first definition.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Why is this set unbounded?

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
Archimedean property.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm giving you a
little short proof on why

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.760 align:middle line:90%
this sequence is unbounded.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Let b be bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:27.730 align:middle line:84%
By the Archimedean
property, there

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:84%
exists a natural number
n such that n is bigger

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:84%
than b, which is
exactly what we wanted

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
to prove because, in this case,
x sub n is n, is unbounded.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:54:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:09.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, what does
it mean for us

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.140 align:middle line:90%
to have a limit of a sequence?

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.272 align:middle line:84%
What does a limit
of a sequence mean?

00:54:14.272 --> 00:54:15.730 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
for a real number

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:17.950 align:middle line:90%
to be the limit of a sequence?

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:21.293 align:middle line:90%


00:54:21.293 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean for a sequence
to converge to something?

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence x sub n
converges to a real number

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.670 align:middle line:84%
x in R if the following
condition is satisfied--

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:55.760 align:middle line:84%
if for every epsilon positive,
there exists a natural number

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:01.940 align:middle line:84%
capital M such that
for all n bigger

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:08.270 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to capital M
xn minus x absolute value

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.112 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:55:10.112 --> 00:55:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember the
absolute value is

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.153 align:middle line:84%
meant to be something
like a distance.

00:55:13.153 --> 00:55:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So what does this statement say?

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.590 align:middle line:84%
This says if I give you a little
bit of tolerance, epsilon,

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and you go far enough
out in the sequence,

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:29.600 align:middle line:84%
then the distance between that
entry in the sequence and x

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:90%
are very close to each other.

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me finish stating the
rest of this definition

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do a little
more discussion.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:57.660 align:middle line:84%
If a sequence converges,
we say it's convergent.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we say
it's divergent.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:90%
So all right, let me draw--

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:24.610 align:middle line:84%
let me draw a little picture
of what this is meant to be.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So the real numbers,
it was this--

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is this
unique ordered field

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.160 align:middle line:84%
with the least upper
bound property.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
about the real numbers,

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.410 align:middle line:84%
think of it as you've
always thought about it,

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.790 align:middle line:90%
as just the real number line.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So what does this
definition mean?

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It means that a sequence
converges to some

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:02.710 align:middle line:84%
x if for every epsilon
I can do the following.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.530 align:middle line:90%
If I look at--

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:22.250 align:middle line:84%
if I give you an epsilon and you
go on either side of x epsilon

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:27.500 align:middle line:84%
amount, then you should be
able to find a capital M so

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that if you look at entries
in your sequence x sub n for n

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.980 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to
M they're in this guy.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So then I should have x sub
M there, x sub M plus 1,

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.560 align:middle line:90%
x sub M plus 2.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And in general, x sub
n should be in there,

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.930 align:middle line:84%
as long as n is bigger
than or equal to M.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So I should be able to do
this for every epsilon.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So for any amount of
tolerance epsilon,

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.560 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to go far
enough out in the sequence

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that all entries
in that sequence

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:12.280 align:middle line:90%
are within this tolerance of x.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, although this is a
picture of what the definition

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.740 align:middle line:90%
means, how should you--

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've probably
gotten plenty of experience

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.430 align:middle line:84%
with sequences when you
were doing calculus.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.490 align:middle line:90%
But what does this mean loosely?

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It means if I look close to x,
some little interval containing

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:13.730 align:middle line:84%
x, then all of the sequence, all
of the elements of the sequence

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.755 align:middle line:90%
should be eventually in this--

00:59:15.755 --> 00:59:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.840 align:middle line:90%
in this little interval.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Or another way to
think about it is

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:33.280 align:middle line:84%
that as I go on in the sequence,
the entries are getting closer

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and closer and closer to
x Now, the way one makes

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.420 align:middle line:84%
these last two intuitive
statements precise

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.850 align:middle line:90%
is via this definition.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The closer and closer
part is encapsulated

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:56.050 align:middle line:90%
in this for all epsilon part.

00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And eventually getting closer
and closer means for all n

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.260 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or
equal to capital M.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.870 align:middle line:84%
As long as I go far enough
out in the sequence,

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.420 align:middle line:90%
they're getting close to x.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.445 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that's pretty clear.

01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:44.080 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
All right, so again,
we have a definition.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%


01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's reasonably interesting.

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So we should do examples,
and then also negate it.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But before I do
either of those, I

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
do want to just prove
a very simple fact

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
about convergent
sequences, namely

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that if I have a sequence
which converges to x, then x

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing that
sequence can converge to.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I cannot have a convergent
sequence which converges to two

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.470 align:middle line:90%
different things.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, if you
go by this intuition

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that eventually the
x sub n's are getting

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
closer and closer and
closer to x, well,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
then there's no way they
can be also getting closer

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:34.733 align:middle line:90%
to something other than x.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
prove that real quick.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll do examples and
a negation of this definition.

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:43.531 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.531 --> 01:01:46.200 align:middle line:90%
So the following theorem--

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm going to state
first the theorem that

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with sequences,

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
but is a nice way if you want
to show two things are equal.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.587 align:middle line:84%
You can show they're
smaller than anything.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So the first theorem
that I'm going to state

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is if x and y are in R and
all epsilon positive x minus y

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
is less than epsilon,
then x equals y.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
surprising statement.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
If I have x and y and
the distance between them

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is arbitrarily small, then
they have to be the same thing.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:33.540 align:middle line:90%


01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%


01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Suppose xy is in R. And for
all epsilon positive, x minus y

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.700 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So now, I want to
prove x equals y.

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that this
does not hold and arrive

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.370 align:middle line:90%
at a contradiction.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a short
proof by contradiction.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Suppose x does not equal y.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Then remember we proved that
the absolute value of something

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
is 0 if and only if
that thing is equal to 0

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's always non-negative.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So x not equal to y means the
absolute value of x minus y

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%
is less than-- is bigger than 0.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%


01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Then by this
assumption, for epsilon

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
equal to x minus
y over 2, I get--

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%


01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
which implies if I just
subtract that over, x minus y

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.720 align:middle line:90%
is less than 0.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
So 1/2 is less than 0 or--

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's a very
false statement.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We've already proven that
the absolute value is always

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
non-negative.

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So if I have two real
numbers that are arbitrarily

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
close to each other, then
they have to be the same.

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use this
theorem to prove that--

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
I put a 1 there--

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
why limits-- and I have not
said that's what we call x--

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
but why a convergent sequence
can only converge to one thing.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.840 align:middle line:90%


01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So here is the statement
of the second theorem.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
If x sub n is a sequence
and it converges

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:49.270 align:middle line:84%
to x and it also converges
to y, then x equals y.

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:55.625 align:middle line:84%
So a convergent sequence can
only converge to one thing.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, like I said,
there should be clear

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
because what's happening is if
I have two things that are not

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
equal and x sub
n converges to x,

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that means as long as I go far
enough out in the sequence,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:16.340 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed to be here in
this small interval around x.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they're supposed
to be converging to y,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
if I go far enough
out, they're also

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be over here as
long as I go far enough out.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But you can't be in two
places at once ever.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
x must equal y.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Although, I suppose
that now we're

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
doing all the classes
online, some are recorded.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can be two places at
once, but at least not here.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going
to use this theorem

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:58.360 align:middle line:90%
to prove this statement.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.910 align:middle line:90%


01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Suppose-- converges to x and y.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want to verify that
for all epsilon positive

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.857 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of
x minus y is less than

01:06:19.857 --> 01:06:20.690 align:middle line:90%
or equal to epsilon.

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:27.340 align:middle line:90%


01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember if I'm proving
something for all epsilon,

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to-- that means I do
it for arbitrary epsilon.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
You get points just for setting
let epsilon be positive.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, I want to show the
absolute value of x minus y

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to epsilon.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're basically going to
do the argument that I just

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.400 align:middle line:90%
erased.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%


01:06:49.870 --> 01:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So since x sub n
converges to x, that

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
implies that there exists a
natural number M1 such that

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger
than or equal to M1,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
x sub n minus x is less
than epsilon over 2.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.502 align:middle line:90%
Why the epsilon over 2?

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:21.585 align:middle line:90%
You'll see, magic happens.

01:07:21.585 --> 01:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%


01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And since x sub
n converges to y,

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
thus this implies that there
exists an M2 natural number

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to M2--

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
so again, this is
the part that says

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
as long as I go far enough out
s sub n has to be close to x.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
part that says as

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
long as I go far enough out x
sub n has to be close to y--

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
so that for all n bigger than
or equal to M2 x sub n minus y

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.290 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon over 2.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%


01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:20.319 align:middle line:84%
Then since the sum M1 plus--
these are both natural numbers.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
This is bigger than
or equal to M1 and M2.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
This implies-- now, I'm going
to use these two inequalities

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and the triangle inequality.

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at the
absolute value of x minus y,

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.680 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to
the absolute value

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.404 align:middle line:84%
of x minus x sub n
plus x sub n minus--

01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:49.300 align:middle line:90%


01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
so let me-- not x sub n, but
x sub M1 plus M2 plus x sub M1

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.139 align:middle line:90%
plus M2.

01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:03.319 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the triangle
inequality, this

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to x
M2 plus M1 plus M2 minus y.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.189 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is less
than epsilon over 2

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
because M1 plus M2 is
bigger than or equal to M1.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:26.439 align:middle line:90%


01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And for the same reason,
since plus M1 plus M2

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.359 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal to
M2, this is less than epsilon

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.514 align:middle line:90%
over 2.

01:09:33.514 --> 01:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Ah, now you see why I
divided both of those

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
by 2 because when I add
them up, I get epsilon.

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.439 align:middle line:84%
So I've shown that for
every epsilon positive,

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.169 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of x
minus y is less than epsilon.

01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by the theorem
that I proved a minute ago,

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
x equals y.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:11.120 align:middle line:90%


01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Why did I state that theorem?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Because I want to use notation.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I want this notation
to be already apparent

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that it's consistent.

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.710 align:middle line:90%


01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
use terminology.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this is not
really a new definition.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just some terminology.

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:49.040 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:57.745 align:middle line:84%
We call x the limit
of the sequence.

01:10:57.745 --> 01:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%


01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fact that I've shown
only that there's only one

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
guy that a sequence
can converge to

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is why I get to use
the word "the--"

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
so not we call x a
limit of x sub n.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the limit because there's
only one, if one exists--

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.050 align:middle line:90%


01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and write x equals limit as n
goes to infinity of x sub n.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%


01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:46.582 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's pause on negating
the definition of what

01:11:46.582 --> 01:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
it means for a sequence
to be convergent.

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And let's do a
couple of examples

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of convergent sequences,
proving that they

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
are convergent sequences
and computing what they--

01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:00.040 align:middle line:90%


01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and at least proving
that these sequences

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
do converge to the limit
that I'm telling you.

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's look
at the constant sequence

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:19.225 align:middle line:84%
x sub n equals 1 for all N. So
that's the sequence 1, 1, 1,

01:12:19.225 --> 01:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.305 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm just going to
write 1, not x sub n.

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The limit as n goes to
infinity of 1 equals 1.

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
This proof is not
very enlightening,

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.880 align:middle line:90%
but I'll show you how it goes.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.680 align:middle line:90%
So you're supposed to show--

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
what does this mean?

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
This means for every
epsilon positive,

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
there exist a natural
number capital M such

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm bigger than
capital M, this minus the limit

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:52.310 align:middle line:90%
should be less than epsilon.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:53.930 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I have to now come
up with a capital M

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
so that x sub n minus
x is less than epsilon

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
whenever little n is bigger
than or equal to capital M.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.712 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to choose
capital M to be 1.

01:13:05.712 --> 01:13:07.045 align:middle line:90%
I can do that for this sequence.

01:13:07.045 --> 01:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%


01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Then if n is bigger
than or equal to M

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and I look at the n-th
entry in the sequence,

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
well, this is just
1 minus 1 equals 0.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's less than epsilon.

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So not very enlightening
because capital M equals 1

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.110 align:middle line:90%
is good enough.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's do something
a little more.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So how about the limit as
n goes to infinity of 1

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
over n equals 0?

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:54.320 align:middle line:90%


01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.595 align:middle line:90%
So let's do a proof of this.

01:13:55.595 --> 01:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%


01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm supposed to be
proving this epsilon statement

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in the definition in order to
be able to state this, which

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.990 align:middle line:90%
is for every epsilon statement.

01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So I start the proof off
with let epsilon be positive.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have to find--

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you how to
choose capital M to ensure

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that little n bigger than
or equal to capital M

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
implies x sub n minus 0, in
this case, is less than epsilon.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So I will say choose capital
M natural number such

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that m is bigger
than 1 over epsilon.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.827 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm not going
to write it that way.

01:14:45.827 --> 01:14:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to write it this way--

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%


01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.180 align:middle line:90%
1 over M is less than epsilon.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And Why Can I do this?

01:14:53.730 --> 01:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Why can I find such a natural
number that satisfies this?

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just insert
statements into your proof--

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
choose capital M to satisfy
the unicorn property--

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and not clarify
why you can choose

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
such a natural number that
satisfies the unicorn property.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I can do this by the
Archimedean property.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
This is equivalently
stating that I

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
can find a natural
number M so that n

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than 1
over epsilon, what

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I had written there originally.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So let me write it this way--

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.420 align:middle line:90%


01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
such an M exists by the
Archimedean property

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
of the natural numbers.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll say that a few
times if I have to

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
or to clarify why certain
natural numbers satisfying

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:53.318 align:middle line:90%
certain properties exist.

01:15:53.318 --> 01:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And then at one
point, I'll just stop

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.235 align:middle line:84%
because it should be clear
that I've done it enough times

01:15:57.235 --> 01:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you know how or why
something does exist.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I choose a natural
number and a natural number

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.950 align:middle line:90%
M so that I have this.

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I need to show you
that this number works.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So let n be bigger
than capital M. Then

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
if I look at x sub n minus my
proposed limit, which is 0--

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
so I look at 1 minus n 0--

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.130 align:middle line:90%
this is equal to just 1 over n.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Since little n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or
equal to capital M, which

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.715 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:16:43.715 --> 01:16:47.550 align:middle line:90%


01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I've proven
what I wanted to prove.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.150 align:middle line:90%
So how do these--

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
if I just give you a sequence
and I ask you to prove that--

01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
so this is some discussion.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
How do you come up
with these proofs?

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:06.727 align:middle line:84%
How should the proof
typically look?

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:07.560 align:middle line:90%
If I want to prove--

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.860 align:middle line:90%


01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:18.840 align:middle line:84%
equals L or x, what's the
proof of that look like?

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It should always-- so the
proof should be let epsilon

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:23.650 align:middle line:90%
be positive.

01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe you need
to do some explaining.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll say choose
M so that something.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.430 align:middle line:90%


01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And that such an
M exists probably

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
will be explained there
or in the same sentence.

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
part of the proof

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
should be showing that
this capital M works.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So then if n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
then you should
show that it works

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
by looking at x sub
n minus x and doing

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
a calculation or inequalities
and arriving at this being less

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
than epsilon, which is what
you're wanting to prove.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.670 align:middle line:84%
You're wanting, in the end, to
verify this definition, which

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
says for every epsilon,
you can find a capital M

01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%
so that I get this.

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So in a proof, you
are carrying that out.

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
You're saying for
epsilon positive,

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I choose M so that this happens.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do you--

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
how do you come up
with such a capital M?

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
just discussion.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we won't get
to any more examples.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll just finish
this discussion,

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:01.360 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll call it a day.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you come up
with such a capital M?

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:06.790 align:middle line:90%
How did I come up with M?

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Why did I choose M in this way?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
In the end, you
can see it here, is

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that I chose it because
if I fiddle around

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
with the thing I want to bound,
I ended up with 1 over n, which

01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I can control and make
it smaller than epsilon.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So typically, how do
you find capital M?

01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:37.070 align:middle line:90%


01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is a discussion, I
guess, within a discussion.

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:43.930 align:middle line:90%


01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Typically, you'll take x sub n
minus x, your proposed limit.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I give you a
sequence explicitly.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's a expression
involving some other sequences.

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And you fiddle around with it.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you write it differently,
or add and subtract something,

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
or multiply it by
1 in a fancy way.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get some
expression typically

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.280 align:middle line:90%
involving something involving n.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:23.270 align:middle line:90%


01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And as long as this expression
involving n is simple enough,

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
then you choose capital
M so that this thing

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.080 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, simple enough,
for example, 1 over n,

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I can choose capital M so
that this is less than epsilon

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:42.970 align:middle line:90%
by the Archimedean property.

01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
If, for example-- and
that's basically 1 over n,

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
or 5 over n, or
something like that,

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that exhausts all the
simplest ones for now.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But if, for example,
you ended up with 1

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
over n squared
minus 3n plus 100,

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I would not say this is a
simple enough expression

01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say choose
capital M so that this is less

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
than epsilon without more
explanation than what I just

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.720 align:middle line:90%
gave here.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%


01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do some more
examples next time

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
to flesh this out
a little bit more.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.340 align:middle line:90%
All right, so we'll stop there.

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:41.000 align:middle line:90%

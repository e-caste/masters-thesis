00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
PROFESSOR: What we
want to understand

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.490
now is really about
momentum space.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.350
So we can ask the
following question--

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.920
what happens to the
normalization condition

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.440
that we have for the
wave function when

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.200
we think in momentum variables?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.980
So yes, I will do this first.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:36.290
So let's think of integral
dx psi of x star psi of x.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.940
Well, this is what we called
the integral, the total integral

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.660
for x squared, the thing
that should be equal to 1

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.570
if you have a probability
interpretation,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.550
for the wave function.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
And what we would
like to understand

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.030
is what does it
say about phi of k?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.730
So for that, I have to
substitute what [? size ?]

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.990
r in terms of k and try to
rethink about this integral how

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.120
to evaluate it.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.930
So for example, here, I
can make a little note

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.690
that I'm going to use a
variable of integration

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.870
that I call k for
the first factor.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.920
And for this factor, I'm
going to use k prime.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.680
You should use different
variables of integration.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.120
Remember, psi of x is
an integral over k.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.580
But we should use different
ones not to get confused.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.410
So here we go--

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.520
dx 1 over square root of 2 pi--

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.360
integral-- we said
this one is over k.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.185
So it would be phi star--

00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:58.000
let me put the dk first--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.530
dk phi star of k e to
the minus ikx and dk.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.570
That's the first psi.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.945
This is psi star.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.665
And now we put psi.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.105
So this is the dk prime--

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:43.180
phi of x dk prime phi of k
prime e to the ik prime x.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.430
It's the same x in
the three places.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.000
OK, at this moment,
you always have

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.150
to think, what do I do next?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.630
There are all these
many integrals.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.590
Well, the integrals
over k, there's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.910
no chance you're going to be
able to do them apparently--

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.830
not to begin with, because
they are abstract integrals.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.770
So k integrals have no chance.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.220
Maybe the integral that
we have here, the dx,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.050
does have a chance.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:33.110
So in fact, let me write
this as integral dk phi

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:46.740
star of k integral dk
prime phi of k prime.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:55.230
And then I have 1 over
2 pi integral dx e

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.795
to the ik prime minus kx.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.840
I think I didn't
miss any factor.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.730
And now comes to help this
integral representation

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.210
of the delta function.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.280
And it's a little opposite
between the role of k and x.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.470
Here the integration
variable is over x.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.910
There is was over k.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.610
But the spirit of the equality
or the representation is valid.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.580
You have the 1 over 2 pi, a
full integral over a variable,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.280
and some quantity here.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.840
And this is delta
of k prime minus k.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.070
And finally, I can
do the last integral.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.665
I can do the integral,
say, over k prime.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.810
And that will just give me--
because a delta function,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.990
that's what it does.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.280
It evaluates the
integrand at the value.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.550
So you integrate over k prime--

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.390
evaluates phi at k.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:39.740
So this is equal to integral
dk phi star of k phi of k.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.330
And that's pretty neat.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.400
Look what we found.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.260
We've found what is called
Parseval's theorem, which

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.070
is that integral dx
of psi of x squared

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:04.400
is actually equal to
integral dk phi of k squared.

00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:11.644
So it's called
Parseval theorem--

00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:15.946
Parseval's theorem.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.860
Sometimes in the
literature, it's also

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.340
called Plancherel's theorem.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.770
I think it depends on the
generality of the identity--

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.200
so Plancherel's theorem.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.480
But this is very nice
for us, because it

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.940
begins to tell us there's,
yes indeed, some more

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.950
physics to phi of k.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.080
Why?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:02.000
The fact that this integral
is equal to 1 was a key thing.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Well, the fact that it
didn't change in time thanks

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.720
to showing the equation
was very important.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.600
It's equal to 1.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.230
We ended up with a
probabilistic interpretation

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.510
for the wave function.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.930
We could argue that this could
be a probability, because it

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.460
made sense.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.890
And now we have a very
similar relation for phi of k.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.470
Not only phi of k represents
as much physics as psi of k,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.360
as psi of x, and it
not only represents

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.900
the weight with which you
superimpose plane waves,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.180
but now it also satisfies
a normalization condition

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.580
that says that the
integral is also

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.286
equal to this integral,
which is equal to 1.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.690
It's starting to lead to
the idea that this phi of k

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.390
could be thought
maybe as a probability

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:05.210
distribution in this new
space, in momentum space.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.790
Now I want to make momentum
space a little bit more clear.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.200
And this involves a little
bit of moving around

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.690
with constants,
but it's important.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.270
We've been using k all the time.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.990
And momentum is h bar k.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.070
But now let's put things
in terms of momentum.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.160
Let's do everything
with momentum itself.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.128
So let's put it here.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.684
So let's go to momentum space,
so to momentum language--

00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:53.590
to momentum language.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.670
And this is not difficult. We
have p is equal to h bar k.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:11.010
So dp over h bar is equal
to dk in our integrals.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:16.830
And we can think
of functions of k,

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:23.680
but these are just other
functions of momentum.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.740
So I can make these replacements
in my Fourier relations.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.680
So these are the two equations
that we wrote there--

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.050
are the ones we're aiming
to write in a more momentum

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.250
language rather than
k, even though it's

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.750
going to cost a few h
bars here and there.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.480
So the first equation
becomes psi of x equal 1

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.840
over square root
of 2 pi integral.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.230
Well, phi of k is now
phi of p with a tilde.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:14.390
e to the ikx is e to
the ipx over h bar.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.320
And dk is equal
to dp over h bar.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.090
Similarly, for the second
equation, instead of phi of k,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.820
you will put phi tilde
of p 1 over square root

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:44.710
of 2 pi integral psi of x e
to the minus ipx over h bar.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:50.220
And that integral doesn't
change much [? dx. ?]

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.480
So I did my change of variables.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.550
And things are not completely
symmetric if you look at them.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.690
Here, they were
beautifully symmetric.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.800
In here, you have
1 over h bar here

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.080
and no h bar floating around.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.760
So we're going to do
one more little change

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.090
for more symmetry.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.020
We're going to redefine.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:34.370
Let phi tilde of p be replaced
by phi of p times square root

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.290
of h bar.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:41.330
You see, I'm doing
this a little fast.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.850
But the idea is that this
is a function I invented.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.460
I can just call it
a little different,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.270
change its normalization
to make it look good.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.800
You can put whatever you want.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800
And one thing I did,
I decided that I

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.630
don't want to carry all
these tildes all the time.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.690
So I'm going to replace phi
tilde of p by this phi of p.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.520
And that shouldn't be
confused with the phi of k.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.150
It's not necessarily
the same thing,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.650
but it's simpler notation.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.520
So if I do that here, look--

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.830
you will have a phi
of p, no tilde, and 1

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.780
over square root of h bar.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.110
Because there will be
e square root of h bar

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.560
in the numerator
and h bar there.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.160
So this first equation
will become psi of x 1

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:43.000
over square root of 2 pi
h bar integral phi of p e

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.340
to the ipx over h bar dp.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.930
And the second
equation, here, you

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.340
must replace it by a phi and
a square root of h bar, which

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.890
will go down to
the same position

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.460
here so that the
inverse equation is

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:11.380
phi of p, now 1 over
square root of 2 pi h bar

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:19.470
integral psi of x e to the
minus ipx over h bar dx.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:32.770
So this is Fourier's theorem
in momentum notation,

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:39.880
in which you're really
something over momenta.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.470
And you put all these h
bars in the right place.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.300
And we've put them
symmetrically.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.920
You could do otherwise.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.535
It's a choice.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.440
But look at the
evolution of things.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.310
We've started with a
standard theorem with k

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.910
and x, then derived
a representation

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:10.510
for the delta function,
derived Parseval's theorem,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:16.840
and finally, rewrote this
in true momentum language.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.210
Now you can ask what happens
to Parseval's theorem.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.500
Well, you have to keep track
of the normalizations what

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.330
will happen.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.530
Look, let me say it.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.690
This left-hand side, when
we do all these changes,

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.550
doesn't change at all.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:42.340
The second one, dk,
gets a dp over h bar.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.160
And this is becomes
phi tilde of p.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.240
But phi tilde of p then
becomes a square root,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240
then it's phi of p.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.130
So you get two square roots
in the numerator and the dk

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.670
that had a h bar
in the denominator.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.000
So they all disappear, happily.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.080
It's a good thing.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:12.920
So Parseval now
reads, integral dx psi

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:24.430
squared of x equal
integral dk phi of k--

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.730
phi of p, I'm sorry.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.250
I just doing p now.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:49.920
And it's a neat formula
that we can use.

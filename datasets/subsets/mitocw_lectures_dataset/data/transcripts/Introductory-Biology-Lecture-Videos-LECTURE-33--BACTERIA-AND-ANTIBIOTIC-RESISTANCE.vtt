WEBVTT

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.640
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
OK, I want to walk us

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.200
through a bit of an
exercise to understand

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.120
what happens when people become
resistant to an antibiotic.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180
What's the molecular
basis for resistance?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.170
It's nothing magical.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.080
It's really things
that you can understand

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.350
based on what you've
learned during various parts

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.290
of the course.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.790
But I just want to remind you
about this dreadful schematic

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.750
here, which shows how
rapidly resistance

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.670
emerges to different antibiotics
by showing you the year

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.810
that the drugs are introduced
and the year that resistances

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.930
develop.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.475
One of the newest antibiotics
to be introduced--

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.850
people thought, oh, it's a
different mechanism of action.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.680
It should be pretty resilient.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.880
It should last for a while.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.380
It should be useful
with daptomycin.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.060
It's a cyclic
peptide antibiotic,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.280
which has a particular
structure that doesn't

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.900
look like a lot of the others.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.300
And honestly, it was
two to three years

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.190
before resistance emerged.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.160
So what I want to
do is think together

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.440
about what are the ways in
which a bacterium could evolve

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.870
to develop resistance
against an antibiotic?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.430
So here we've got the target.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.770
We know that the
antibiotic is very

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.260
effective against the target.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.350
What types of things could
happen in the bacterium

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.330
to make it manage to just
ignore the antibiotic

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.320
and resist the antibiotic?

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.850
Any suggestions?

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.120
So it's very simple.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.030
There's a molecular target.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.190
It could be topoisomerase.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.480
It could be in fact the
ribosome and the machinery

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.850
for synthesizing proteins.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.270
It could be the machinery that
cross-links peptidoglycan.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
What sorts of approaches
and what sorts of strategies

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
might evolve to make that
antibiotic stop working?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.520
OK, fire.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.420
Yes.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.340
AUDIENCE: When two
hydrogen-holding enzymes

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.692
at-- create things that are
not [INAUDIBLE] absorbing.

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:32.900
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK, right.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.000
So antibiotic gets in.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.230
The enzyme breaks up the
antibiotic, so evolution

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.580
to destroy the antibiotic.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.160
And that's very much what
happens with penicillin.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.460
The key aspect of the
structure that's so useful

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.300
suddenly becomes invalidated
through a degradation

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.710
of the beta-lactam bond.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.690
So that's one of them.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.180
What's next?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.680
Yeah.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.950
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Ah, so maybe there

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:25.050
could be uptake decreased,
so that's quite hard,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.360
but there could be some
evolution of the cell wall

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.320
to make it less permeable
to the antibiotic

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.550
because we're usually relying
on antibiotics to diffuse

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.810
in passively.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.830
So if the membrane--

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.740
this could be in a membrane
of a Gram-negative bacterium,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.930
or the outer membrane of a
Gram-negative bacterium that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.820
has a slightly
different composition,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.110
could physically
change its structure.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.810
These are tough things
to evolve all at once,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.840
but it's certainly
a possibility.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.160
We've talked about uptake.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.660
What about-- what
else could happen?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.160
Yes.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.325
AUDIENCE: When you
get a [INAUDIBLE] out,

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:12.063
such that they have
oxygen [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:12.980
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.530
So this guy could just--

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.470
we've got a circular
antibiotic usually,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.410
but this just changes--

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.910
the target just changes.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.380
It can't bind anymore,
through mutation,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.090
so that the antibiotic
simply doesn't bind.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.850
It gets in, but it's changed,
and that happens a lot.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.460
It also happens a lot--

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.860
one can think of
antibiotic resistance

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.340
very much along the same veins
as one thinks of resistance

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.590
to chemotherapeutic agents.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.540
You're targeting a kinase.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.460
Your drug works great.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.800
A year later, the
cancer comes back

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.530
because there's a single
mutation in your target.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.380
This happens a lot with the
EGF, kinase, RAS's and so on.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.360
There's a dramatic change.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.030
So this change would be
a change in the target.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.250
You mentioned two things, right?

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.820
I thought.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.950
Maybe not.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.367
AUDIENCE: Well,
like I said, there

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:08.659
were some for that [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:09.600
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Ah.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.230
On the surface.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.030
AUDIENCE: A couple of days
you're going back, so.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.697
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
OK, so there could be

00:05:13.697 --> 00:05:16.600
some kind of import strategy.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.320
So some antibiotics
just diffuse.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.010
Some go in through
targeted import,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.780
and that might change so
that the antibiotic can't

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.075
get in anymore.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:26.700
Other thoughts?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.230
There's a couple of
other sneaky ways.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.660
I mean, you've got to sort
of give these bacteria credit

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.210
for maximum sneakiness.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.110
So if influx is an
issue, what about efflux?

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.320
The biggest problem
with antibiotics

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.550
against Gram-negatives is
that they way upregulate

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.050
efflux pumps.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.267
They just, like, cover their
cells with pumps that just go,

00:05:57.267 --> 00:05:58.850
you're going to give
me an antibiotic?

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.400
I'm just going to lob it
straight back out to you.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.630
So the efflux pumps increase.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.860
So their molecules, we
have a lot of efflux pumps

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.240
to just kick out
things that are not--

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.500
that we don't want in our cells.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.940
The bacteria have
similar things.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.900
They will-- they're
fairly promiscuous,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.450
exporting pumps that
will bind to things

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.150
that don't look like things
that should be in a cell,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.170
and literally bind to them on
the inside of the membrane,

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.680
[MAKES SQUIRT SOUND]
send them back

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.580
to the outside of the membrane.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.450
So Gram-negative
bacteria can massively

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.520
upregulate the
production of a pump

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.640
that they already have, but they
just make much more of them.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.080
So in many cases, you can
hardly test a new compound

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.530
because it's getting pumped out
as fast as it gets pumped in.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.790
What could be a strategy
when this happens?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.050
Because people are doing this.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.650
You inhibit the pump.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.500
So you make your antibiotic--

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.440
it works great, but you
stop the pump working.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.190
So you have to give two
drugs, the drug that's

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.430
the antibiotic to the target
and the drug that inhibits

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.980
the pump, and that happens.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.480
Similarly, with this mechanism,
where the antibiotic gets

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.610
destroyed, you can
recover from this

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.850
by inhibiting the
destroying enzyme,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.200
and then your antibiotic
doesn't get destroyed

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.130
when it gets into the cells.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.910
So there's one extremely
important formulation

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.980
of antibiotic that is used.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.285
It's called Augmentin.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.350
And what it is is
a penicillin plus

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.550
a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.950
It's the drug that
works plus a drug that

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.890
inhibits the enzyme
that destroys the drug.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.420
People get this all the time.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.340
Every day of the week,
this stuff is prescribed.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.510
It's a two-compound
cocktail that

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.480
has something to overcome the
resistance so that your drug

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.950
still works in a cell.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.790
All right?

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.130
And there's one
more key mechanism,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.370
and what bacteria will just do
is they say, well, you know,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.430
I'm getting dosed with
this much antibiotic.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:29.920
What's a good way around it
is to massively upregulate

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.520
the biosynthesis of the target
to a state where you just

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.320
can't saturate it all.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.440
So upregulation of the target
is a very, very common thing.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.770
So you-- this should have
just increased the number

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.419
of transcripts being made.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.960
You increase the amount
of target being made so

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.370
that, even if antibiotics
are flooding into cells,

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.120
there's just not enough to
inhibit all of the target

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.270
because it's been upregulated
by 10 or 100-fold.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.050
So what I think is cool
about all these mechanisms

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.143
is they all make sense.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:04.810
You just kind of have
to think of them--

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.280
do I stop the drug getting in?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.350
Do I stop it getting pumped out?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.420
Do I stop it getting degraded?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.340
Do I make more target?

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.380
All of those things
are very viable,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.380
and they are strategies that
are used quite commonly.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:23.710
So very commonly, both in
bacteria and in viruses,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.960
we seldom give one compound.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.820
We commonly give
multiple compounds

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.740
to sort of hit multiple
targets, because if you

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.790
gave a two-drug
cocktail to a bacterium,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.030
but you knew there was going
to be upregulation of a target,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.540
you could hope that the other
enzyme is still a target.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.150
So you give cocktails of drugs,
as opposed to single drugs.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.590
And you're going to see
that very relevantly when

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.430
we talk about the HIV
virus because it's only

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.880
been that HIV has become--

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.450
HIV-AIDS has become
a treatable condition

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.750
because of drug cocktails, not
because of singular drugs that

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.280
inhibit one step.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.470
And you'll see it very,
very commonly there.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.240
Any questions about this stuff?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.803
OK.

00:10:11.803 --> 00:10:13.345
So we're going to
move on to viruses.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.330
And so I will actually update
the slides that are on the web

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.790
to give you this
set of information

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.520
so you can see it in one place.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.160
OK, viruses.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.350
Viruses are
fascinating organisms.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.300
They don't have the
right to be alive

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.720
because they don't have
the machinery to be alive,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.690
but they exploit the
host's mechanisms

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.950
for completing their viability.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.030
So viruses, more
or less, I think

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:11.120
we like to think of them
as living a borrowed life.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:23.000
And they only survive
if they have spent

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.430
some time inside a host cell.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.440
So we will see with viruses,
some viruses specifically

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.510
target humans.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.050
Other viruses may spend some
time in different organisms,

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.960
and then target humans,
and be carried around

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.430
amongst different organisms.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.270
But the key thing is
that viruses can only

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.750
actually replicate once
they're inside a host cell

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.780
because they basically
exploit all of the host cell's

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.520
machinery to do that.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.850
So viruses don't make
many of their own enzymes.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.670
They don't have their
own amino acid supplies

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.520
or all the metabolic
enzymes that

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.550
are required for life, all the
replication, transcription,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.370
translation machinery.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.590
They just borrow the
host's machinery,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.160
but there are occasionally
individual components

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.960
that the virus will
bring along with it

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.850
to cover certain things that
are not provided by the hosts.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.890
But viral genomes are tiny.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.130
They may comprise
maybe eight genes.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.010
Some of them are a
lot-- are bigger,

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.000
but they are very,
very small genomes.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.890
They're very, what we
call, parsimonious genomes,

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.320
so there's overlapping
genes, so you can keep

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.960
the genome tiny by having--

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.720
compacting the
size of the genome.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.890
And then there are
bigger viruses.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.570
Some of the biggest viruses
approach the sizes of bacteria,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.820
like the mimiviruses,
and they may

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.150
have been an intermediate
step from virus

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.420
to more elaborated organisms.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.240
And those viruses have
a bit more machinery

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.740
within their contexts.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.720
People-- obviously, there's
no fossil record for viruses.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.800
It's not like we can go,
you know, go exploring

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.690
and find a fossil record.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.580
But where these
viruses are being found

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.310
is in the permafrost,
so they're frozen.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.160
They've been frozen
there for centuries.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.740
So people are finding
really sort of scary things

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.680
in the Siberian permafrost
because the viruses are

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.300
preserved there.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.000
And some of these
giant viruses are being

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.130
discovered in those locations.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.120
And if that's not the subject
for wonderful sci-fi books,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.060
I don't know what is,
because there are-- and I

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.850
tend to read those things
because my favorite thing is

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.610
finding mistakes in them.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.620
So there's a lot out there
about those kinds of things.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.642
So let me just show
you a tiny bit about--

00:14:08.642 --> 00:14:11.710
you know, this is that boring
old "learn genetics" thing

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.280
right from the beginning, but
what I want to take you back to

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.210
is sizes.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.380
So we know all this stuff.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.535
We've learned it to death,
hemoglobin, antibodies,

00:14:20.535 --> 00:14:22.030
and ribosome.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.870
But what I really want to
point out on this slide is that

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.170
the smallest viruses,
like the rhinovirus--

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.730
that's the common cold--

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.120
or the hepatitis virus
are not barely any bigger

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.250
than the ribosome.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.370
So obviously, there's
not much in the virus,

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.680
but all the components
of the virus

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.130
have evolved to enable them to
sneakily get into host cells,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.030
exploit the host cell
machinery, and then replicate

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.330
inside host cell, and then
get out of the host cell

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.940
and ready to infect
another host cell.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.030
So I want you to really
notice these sizes.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.650
So the rhinovirus is
similar to a ribosome,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.980
but some viruses, which
we will talk about,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.840
the influenza virus and the
HIV virus are a little bigger,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.820
but none of them compete up
to the size of a bacterium.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.900
And just to get you into that
mode, there are the bacteria,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.030
and there's the
mitochondria, and remember

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.690
endosymbiotic theory, bacteria,
similar size to mitochondria,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.880
and much, much bigger
than any typical virus.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.060
But giant viruses approach
some of these bigger sizes.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.790
They're a different
ballgame altogether.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.890
And we won't talk about
them, apart from the fact

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.396
that they're really cool, and
they're in the permafrost.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.680
All right, so another
impressive thing

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.300
about viruses, as they look--
some of them like this.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.110
Phage, a bacterial virus,
they look like things,

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.530
lunar landers, for example, or
sort of other kinds of things.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.110
Some of them are linear.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.510
Some of them are
different kinds of shapes.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.760
A lot of viruses are icosahedra.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.320
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.330
But the fact sheet about
viruses is first of all sizes.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.980
And the typical viral size,
if there is something typical,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:35.710
expand from 20 to 400
nanometers in diameter.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.810
So remember, the
ribosome sits right

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:47.030
at this end with respect
to size, but bacteria--

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:52.090
oh, yellow, I can't do
a yellow lecture here--

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.060
remember, are 1 to 10
micrometers in length,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.730
depending on what
dimension you're measuring,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.030
so considerably smaller,
nanometer scale,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.589
micrometer scale for bacteria.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.910
So that's the first thing
that it's important to know.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.760
They're very small.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.420
The next critical thing
is what's in a virus?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.109
What is its-- what's the
blood and guts of a virus?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:28.860
And it's either
DNA or RNA, and it

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.940
can be single-stranded
or double-stranded.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.690
So it has its genetic material.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.910
Its genetic material
is usually dedicated

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.170
to making more copies of itself.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.180
So if the virus has a
coat, a coat of proteins,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.460
the virus has to
have a gene for that

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.460
because the host isn't going
to have a coat for a virus.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.820
So the virus has to have
certain specialized things that

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.950
complete itself that can't be
borrowed from the host cell.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.280
And they can be--

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.420
let's see-- they can be what
are called capsid viruses

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.350
or enveloped.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.480
Capsid viruses just
have a protein coat.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.260
The enveloped viruses have
a membrane surrounding them

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.420
with proteins stuck into them.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:31.400
So the enveloped viruses
have an outer membrane

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.995
which is studded with proteins.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.570
But what is cool
about the virus is

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.100
it never makes
its own membranes.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.320
It doesn't make
its phospholipids.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.470
It just, as it emerges
from a host cell,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.690
pinches a piece of
the cell surface.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.500
It steals the cellular
membrane with it,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.660
as it's emerging from a cell.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.630
And you'll see this in
a video, how cool that

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.890
is, all the proteins that--
all the components of the virus

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.500
cluster near the
surface of a membrane,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.560
and then you have this
wonderful endocytosis

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.190
using the host membrane.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.232
So the virus never has
to make it own membrane.

00:19:11.232 --> 00:19:14.960
And not all viruses are
enveloped, just some of them,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.540
and you'll see examples of each.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.400
So the definition
really is that they're

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.270
small, infectious
agents, that they only

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.870
replicate inside living
cells because they

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.040
have to exploit a lot of the
machinery of living cells.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.150
And they can infect
humans, other animals.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.860
There are plant viruses.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.450
Bacteria have viruses.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:42.100
So all living organisms have
viruses that infect them.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.630
But viruses are usually targeted
very specifically to the cells

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.950
that they infect.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.530
And, in fact, you
will see with HIV,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.100
it's not just a virus
that infects a human host.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.140
It infects
specifically, and that

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.830
was why it was so terrifying,
this-- actually T cells.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.720
That's the one cell type in
the host that it goes after.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.210
So viruses very often
target to particular organs

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.810
within their hosts,
and that's why

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.250
we know some of the viruses.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.770
And you'll see that the
names of the viruses

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.300
are related to the organs
that they may infect.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.970
So I want to just briefly
describe the terms.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.100
We talk about these with
all infectious diseases,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.440
that they may be endemic,
epidemic, and pandemic.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.710
Endemic is the term
that we use for, there's

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.830
a very low level of
an infectious agent

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.420
in the population.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.760
It's completely out of--

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.230
within control.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.710
There's a few cases,
but there's not

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.200
a transfer from person to
person or animal to animal.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.550
We would call that endemic, a
very, very low level of virus

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.920
that doesn't cause any threat.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.390
As soon as the virus or
bacterial infectious agents

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.390
starts spreading amongst
a local population,

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.920
we would call that
a local epidemic, so

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.280
all of a community,
all of a country,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.890
so very much defined
geographically

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.660
into a particular space where
there's transmission of viruses

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.980
from person to person or animal
to person within a community.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.530
There has to be direct contact.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.480
But now, with
travel, many viruses

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.170
reach pandemic stages,
which means worldwide.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.220
So plane travel really
caused enormous trouble

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.220
because you can have a
virus in Africa or Asia.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.280
Somebody gets on a plane
and ends up somewhere else,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.210
and the virus has been
moved to a new country.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.430
I made the terrible mistake of
reading Hot Zone on a plane one

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.550
time, which is about
Marburg virus, which

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.820
is where people basically just
start bleeding out in the spot.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.430
And I'm reading
this book, and it's

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.010
describing the
steps of someone who

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.310
had Marburg and was just sort
of bleeding out next to them

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.090
on the plane.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.450
And I'm like, are you crazy,
reading this book on a plane?

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.360
Because they were describing
how Marburg was just

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.770
moved from its country of
origin to New York City,

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.240
or something like that.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.410
So you remember when we
had the Ebola concerns.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.260
There was a real,
genuine worry that Ebola

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.400
would jump through
flight travel,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.590
through people coming
in at airports,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.740
and end up with a
pandemic of Ebola.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:50.070
When there was a real problem
with the avian flu in Asia,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.030
Singapore, that's very, very
protective of its territory,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.930
had sensors that would--
you would go into Singapore,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.960
and you'd go down these
two huge escalators.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.750
And they had sensors
measuring people's temperature

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.220
at a distance as they came
down the escalator, and hauling

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.880
people over, and sort
of interrogating them,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.140
where have you been?--

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.260
to see whether they would be
allowed to enter Singapore,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.500
because the flight travel,
people getting on planes,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.230
spreading a very contagious
virus to a new country

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.780
is very, very realistic.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.460
The issue with spreading
to pandemic situations

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.600
is very, very important
when one thinks of history,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.030
because when the Europeans
were conquering the Americas,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.210
in particular South America
and Central America,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.070
they brought with
them a lot of viruses.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.220
But there was an innate
sort of resistance

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.220
to-- because of years
and years of exposure.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.520
But these communities have
never seen these viruses,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.910
so millions of people died
because they were suddenly

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.110
exposed to a human virus that
they had never seen before,

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.650
through transmission from a
country where there wasn't

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.700
such a problem with the virus.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.430
So the indigenous peoples
of the Americas, Australia,

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.810
and New Zealand had
terrible consequences there.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.690
Some of you have probably
heard of the Spanish flu,

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:23.460
and that was towards the
tail end of World War I

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.010
and is thought to have killed
as many as 100 million people.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.760
And that, in fact,
is quite interesting.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.910
It's called the Spanish flu,
but there's some evidence

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.670
that it might have
originated in the Americas,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.300
in the boats that took
troops over to Europe

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.740
to help at the tail end
of the First World War.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.330
And there's a really interesting
book about that whole story,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.780
that the Spanish flu may not
have originated in Spain.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.510
And that's a-- it's
definitely a worthwhile read.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.370
So that tells you a lot about
the statistics of viruses.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:01.050
I just want to highlight
here, we talk about HIV

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.420
as a very serious virus.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.790
It emerged in the early
'80s to this current--

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.320
well, in 2011, there were
35 million people infected.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.040
There's about 2 and 1/2
million new cases a year.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.190
But what's fascinating
about HIV--

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.010
there was a stage before
the really good antivirals

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.520
were available that,
if the mother had HIV,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.920
the baby would get HIV.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.950
But now, if there's
treatment of the mother,

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.330
and the baby is delivered,
often by a Caesarean section,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.390
the baby can escape
being infected

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.760
with the virus due to
the new antivirals.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.220
So that's really
important, that the--

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.920
originally, there were a
lot of cases of newborns who

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.280
simply got HIV during birth.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.520
But now that can be--
there's escape from that,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.840
which is really, really cool.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.450
The viral load can
be brought really low

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.570
with the common
antivirals against HIV,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.700
and that next generation
doesn't have that sentence.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.310
So I mentioned to you
that a lot of viruses

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.720
are basically named after
the organs that they hit.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.820
So I've just got
a human being here

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.020
with a lot of different viruses
that hit different places,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.480
and I just want to
point out a few points.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.520
Viruses may be targets nowadays
of childhood vaccinations,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.450
and many of you--

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.280
I hope all of you--

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.540
have had vaccinations to
many of these common viruses.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.980
There is a concern now with
communities that are deciding

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.700
not to vaccinate children.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.960
That's a huge social problem
that may, initially, sort of,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.750
people can get away
with it because there's

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.820
community vaccination.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.130
You're in a community
where a lot of people

00:26:53.130 --> 00:27:00.420
have a resistance or some
sort of immunity to a virus.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.440
But as communities become
less and less vaccinated,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.390
than later
generations will start

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.400
to get the disease seriously.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.860
And that's actually happening
in parts of the world where

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.440
there's--

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.280
there used to be no
polio, and now there's

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.630
polio emerging because
the community immunity has

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.280
been-- is fading away.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.530
So we hope that
people get vaccinated.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.970
That's for sure.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.800
The vaccinations work.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.310
Several vaccinations--
several viruses

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.410
were pretty much eradicated.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:39.360
Smallpox and polio were two
of the real poster examples

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.300
of childhood
vaccinations that worked

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.400
and worked amazingly well.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.590
But now, there's a
problem with failure

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.900
to vaccinate in certain
parts of the world.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.420
So that's a concern.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.080
And then, another interesting
thing is that some viruses--

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.070
whoops, oops, go back.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.570
Sorry.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.690
Go back, back, back, back.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.023
Don't now-- that's all a secret.

00:28:01.023 --> 00:28:02.560
You can't see that just yet.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.910
Some viruses lead to cancer,
so human papilloma virus,

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.800
where there is a vaccine,
the people who have HIV--

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.730
some of the types of
hepatitis and Epstein-Barr

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.630
are all associated with
later cases of cancer.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.040
That's important to know.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.090
So often cancers are named by
the organ that they attach,

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.100
so even though the three--

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.020
the five hepatitises all attack
the liver, they're not related.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.210
They're just five viruses
that go off to the liver.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.060
So if you've had a
vaccination against Hep A,

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.892
It doesn't protect you from
Hep B or C by a relationship.

00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:43.600
They're very, very
different, so you have

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.860
to have different vaccinations.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.610
So this just gives you a
nice view of human viruses,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.510
what their names are, what
organs they may attack,

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.450
what sorts of things they
might be associated with.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.360
But the trouble is, this
nomenclature doesn't get you

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.780
anywhere towards understanding
the mechanism of a virus.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:07.210
So what we will focus on
is a much better system

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.060
for describing
viruses that's based

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.010
on whether they have DNA
or RNA within the genomes

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.430
that they import
into host cells,

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.980
and whether that DNA or
RNA is single-stranded or

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.100
double-stranded, because
that truly tells us

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.280
a lot more about the virus
and maybe the steps that

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.880
could be inhibited to
prevent the viral infections.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.050
But first of all,
just a few pictures--

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.350
here's some-- so viruses
can be rod-shaped.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.510
They can look like--

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.640
they can be icosahedra.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.860
They can just have a capsid.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.380
So I mentioned they
may just have a protein

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.600
coat, the sets of
repeating proteins that

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.010
pack into a beautiful structure,
very commonly an icosahedron,

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.290
and I'll show you why that is.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.290
Or they may be
enveloped viruses,

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.180
like, influenza has a
membranous surface around where

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.560
the DNA is packaged.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.800
All of these have nucleic
acids packaged within them,

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.070
DNA or RNA, single
or double-stranded.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.240
And in the case of
the enveloped viruses,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.070
that membrane-- it's
a normal membrane.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.600
It's just like your membrane.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.070
In fact, it is your membrane--

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.730
will have proteins
dotted within it

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.750
that's actually-- serve as
recognition to the host cells.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.680
They'll grab onto host cells and
be the source of the infection

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.405
into the host cells.

00:30:34.405 --> 00:30:39.037
And this is a bacterial
virus, and as I said,

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.120
I just love the way they--

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.650
I mean, they really
look like this.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.748
You know, the cartoon
is really the cartoon

00:30:43.748 --> 00:30:45.790
of what the thing looks
like, and they're sort of

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.810
pretty amazing.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.220
And they kind of--

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.970
they keep their nucleic
acid in the head here.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.320
They land on their sort of feet,
and they shoot the nucleic acid

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.580
material into the host cells.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.590
So that's very interesting.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.330
Of course, this thing is--

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.830
OK.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:08.450
So why are many viruses that
are capsid viruses icosahedra?

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:13.120
So it ends up being a
problem of geometry.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.640
So how can you make a
perfect coat around something

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.820
with very, very few building
blocks of different types?

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.220
Like, if every building block
in that coat was different,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.150
the virus would have to
have genes for all of them.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.370
What viruses can
do is they can have

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:34.540
genes for, like, three pieces
of a module of the virus.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.020
So I'm going to show you
how these capsid viruses get

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.640
assembled.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.260
So here, color-coded,
is an icosahedral virus,

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.330
where I've coded in the
red, green, and blue,

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.510
a triangular component--
this is really cool--

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.970
that is a single sort of panel
on that icosahedral virus that

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.310
comes together as
a triangle through

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:05.110
noncovalent interactions
between three proteins.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.210
You see that panel there.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.510
What you can then do is
see how that panel would

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.920
fit into a pentagon with an
extra triangle stuck onto it,

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.290
and you can fit that
triangle into the pentagon

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.700
and also into the
additional piece.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.850
And then you can
start to visualize

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.200
how you could build an
icosahedron from those pieces

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.120
because they represent each of
those faces within the virus.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:40.210
So you can go from this, which
is a set of building blocks

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.660
that I just showed you--

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.840
then you can assemble
them like this.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.070
And one of these would be
this part of the icosahedron,

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.570
and then you just have
a bunch of copies of it.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.810
And you can see how you
would assemble that.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.710
And years ago, I decided to
decorate my Christmas tree

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.370
with icosahedra.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.450
So I went through this
geometrical thing,

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.320
and believe me, it
works really nicely.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.220
You can put together
an icosahedron

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.880
and build an icosahedron.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.330
You could spray it gold and
put it on your Christmas tree.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.550
It's kind of fanatical,
but it really-- it's

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.670
highly recommended.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.670
All right, so let's now get down
to something a little bit more

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.820
serious than Christmas
trees and things.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.450
All right, so I told you that
the classification of viruses

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:35.240
by what organ they attack or
who discovered them or anything

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.060
is just--

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.960
is a vagary that's not so
useful to the non-physicians

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.950
because you can't
immediately know,

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.300
oh, this is how the virus
gets into the host cell.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.930
This is how the virus
uses its genetic material

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.760
to make new viruses.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.280
So what was developed
by Baltimore--

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.540
David Baltimore used to be at--

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.880
it was kind of interesting.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.220
David Baltimore, a very famous
person and Nobel laureate,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.020
used to be at MIT
when I was at Caltech,

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.880
and we moved in
opposite directions.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.830
I'm not sure it was a
great trade for MIT,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.150
but it was a great
trade for Caltech.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.409
So I ended up with David
Baltimore's labs in Building 68

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:18.270
because we did that swap in
1999 or something like that.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.219
So I thought that was
pretty interesting.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.310
Anyway, so what
Baltimore decided

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.940
is-- was much better
to classify viruses

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.568
by the type of genetic material,
like, are they DNA or RNA?

00:34:31.568 --> 00:34:34.530
Is that DNA or RNA
single-stranded or

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.850
double-stranded?

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:39.989
Because, depending on what the
genetic material in the virus

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:44.370
is, once that gets
unloaded into a host cell,

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.219
certain steps have to happen
in order for the virus

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.159
to be able to replicate
that genetic material,

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.310
to convert it ultimately
into the proteins

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:59.340
it needs, and then to package
up new viral genetic material

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.940
into viral capsids
so that they can then

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.760
be sprung out of the cell
and go infect another cell.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.050
So the classification
basically went this way.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:17.070
So if you think of it, what the
major goal in the infected cell

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.850
is to get the virus to a
stage where the virus has

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.920
plus-messenger RNA.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.960
It has RNA that can be read
by the host's ribosomes

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.950
and convert it into proteins.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.130
So the overall
goal of the virus,

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:36.930
if we give it sort of some
conscience, shall we say,

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:41.710
is to make its viral
material into messenger RNA.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.580
Now, the virus doesn't
include messenger RNA.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.070
That's just what is
made transiently,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.550
but the virus may have
single-stranded DNA.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.490
It may have plus-sense RNA.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.890
It may have negative-sense RNA.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.440
It could have
double-stranded DNA,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.560
or it could even have
double-stranded RNA.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.290
And depending on what
that genetic material,

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.170
is what the Baltimore
classification of a virus

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:07.920
would be.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.200
So depending on what's
inside the virus,

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.090
then they can be classified.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.540
And what we're going to go
through today and on Friday

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:22.020
is examples of class I, class
V, and class VI viruses,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.130
so we can see how that
genetic material ultimately

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.310
becomes a new viral--

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:32.160
a new virus within a host cell,
or at least the components

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.070
thereof ready to be
sprung out of a virus.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:44.040
And there's one important point
that I want to also address--

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.740
oops-- budding or lytic.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.890
All right, there are
two ways in which

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.160
viruses escape their host cell.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.190
They may be budding.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.280
So here you have a host cell.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.740
The viral components
all congregate

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.970
near the surface of the
membrane from the inside,

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.710
and then the host cell buds off.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:17.790
The viral components go with
it, and the bud splits off.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.370
So the host cell
has its nucleus.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.840
It's still intact.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.970
HIV is such a virus.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.190
HIV doesn't kill its hosts.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.820
That's the best
sign of a parasite.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.650
It wants the host to stick
around, so it just buds off.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:37.410
The other types of
viruses are lytic,

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:42.720
and, basically, the cell just
bursts open and throws out

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.260
the virus.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.290
So they're in two categories.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.413
Some of them are budding,
though the enveloped viruses

00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.830
have to be budding
because they're

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.250
going to take with them the
membrane of the host cell.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:53.910
All right?

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.980
So that's another
important difference.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.350
So what have we got here?

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:04.050
So ultimately, the goal is to be
able to make a plus-strand mRNA

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.010
for protein synthesis.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.320
So we really need to have the
appropriate sense of the RNA

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.420
that will dictate the
protein synthesis.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.520
So let's first of all look at
one of the simple versions,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.930
a double-stranded DNA virus.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:23.280
And this is represented
by the smallpox virus.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.900
So everybody's heard of
that, and herpes simplex.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.090
And these are both
enveloped viruses,

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.305
so that means they
have a membrane shell.

00:38:33.305 --> 00:38:34.680
And so I'm just
going to walk you

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.920
through the steps of going
from the double-stranded DNA

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.420
to make a new virus.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.950
So here's the virus.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:46.500
It has a capsid, as well
as a membrane envelope.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.310
And there's recognition between
the virus and the host cell.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:54.090
And we'll talk very specifically
about what that recognition is

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.530
when we talk about HIV, because
that's very well categorized.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.380
Once the virus gets
into the host cell,

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.340
it sort of spills off
all the coat and dumps

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.140
out its double-stranded DNA, the
viral DNA, into the host cell.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.750
And then that DNA can--

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.570
in the nucleus, can
replicate into more copies

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:20.880
of the viral DNA, or
it can be transcribed

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.000
into messenger
RNA, which is then

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.830
the coat for all those capsid
proteins that the virus needs.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.550
And then these start to
self-assemble within the host

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:37.170
cell where the capsid
proteins wrap around

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.450
the viral genetic material.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.870
They accumulate near
the surface of the cell,

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.520
and then they bud
off from the cell.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.120
So that's how you
go from simple DNA.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.450
So these processes
are completely

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:56.790
based on the human enzymes
that do those processes.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.400
Replication, we've
got to replicate DNA.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.553
We're going to have to
do that in the nucleus.

00:40:01.553 --> 00:40:02.970
Transcription,
we're going to have

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.650
to ship out part of the DNA from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.300
and make--

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.240
we're going to have to make
a copy of the messenger RNA

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.010
and ship it out to the nucleus.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.520
And then we're going to use
the host ribosomes, the host's

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.130
amino acids, the building
blocks in everything,

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.850
to make a new protein that
is not a host's cell protein.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.610
It's the capsid protein.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.230
Obviously, the human
cell isn't going

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.310
to be making a capsid protein.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.050
So that's the main thing
that the virus had to encode.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.300
It had to have the
DNA to make that.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.460
So that all looks
sort of fairly simple,

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.240
and the steps make sense.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.710
This is why we cover this
virus first because it really--

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.790
it's kind of the most
transparent to understand,

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:50.470
so this transient stage of
sort of borrowing machinery.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.730
And as I mentioned
here, the virus

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.710
can spring out of the host cell.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.396
Yes.

00:40:57.396 --> 00:41:00.584
AUDIENCE: So all it means is--
one's that don't kill the host

00:41:00.584 --> 00:41:05.513
cells, how do they, like, on the
body, or the cells that they--

00:41:05.513 --> 00:41:08.055
BARBARA IMPERIALI: They start
to just be too much of a burden

00:41:08.055 --> 00:41:10.080
onto the body, so they're just--

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.650
you know, if they're
inside cells and exploiting

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.040
the resources of the
cell, they're basically--

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.830
they're harming it, but they're
not destroying it instantly

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:20.980
every life cycle.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.860
They're just using resources
to replicate, and then go--

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.140
get spread to another
cell, and another cell,

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.710
where they'll keep
using resources.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.890
So it's really just an
overload of the system.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.050
It's a very good point.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.670
But they can stick
around a long time,

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.610
and with HIV,
you're going to see

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.380
what really sneaky
thing they do is

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.420
because they put their
genome into the host genome.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.860
And that's sort of
really pretty terrifying.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.560
I always ask this question,
but it's kind of a silly one.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.570
You know, what is life?

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.280
A virus is alive.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.040
Well, they're kind of alive,
but they're not really alive

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.110
unless they have
some place to live.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.850
But aren't we all like that?

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.290
So that's very philosophical.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.660
So we'll move right on here.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.940
So when you think
of a virus, this

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.310
is the original
central dogma, all

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.920
the moving parts of
the central dogma.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.230
And note-- so that when
you think of a virus,

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.190
what double-- what does
double-stranded DNA need

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.440
from the host?

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.060
It's got all of these things.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.090
It's got the-- the host
has the polymerase.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.400
It has the DNA-dependent
RNA polymerase.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.580
It's got all the
ribosomal machinery.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.920
So the only thing
that the virus needs

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.010
is the gene for its
capsid proteins.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.060
So you can peel out from
that entire life cycle

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.630
the one unique thing
about the virus.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.380
So that's a double-stranded DNA.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.650
Let's now move to a
different type of V,

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.370
which is a
negative-stranded RNA virus.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.560
And these are quite
important because these

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.020
form the basis for--

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.950
let me just go to the diseases.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.940
This is the influenza
virus, and I'm

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.770
going to mention some
very important points

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.290
relative to influenza virus.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:10.395
So influenza virus is what's
known as a segmented virus.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.470
And what that means
is that its genome--

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.630
in this case, it's
negative-stranded RNA--

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:25.375
is in pieces.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:45.280
A lot of other viruses just
have a single strand of genome,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.240
a single nucleic acid strand.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:44:00.740
So it's just one piece, where
portions of that nucleic acid

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.830
code for different
proteins, and they'll often

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.710
code for initially polyproteins
that get broken up.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.400
And we'll see a virus
with a single strand

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.140
when we look at HIV.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.630
But the influenza virus
has a segmented genome.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.270
And that's very relevant
for its lifestyle

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.980
because we'll see in a moment
how influenza virus can cause

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.820
more damage than we anticipate
because of recombination

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.580
of different copies
of the segmented virus

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.610
through differences.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.610
But let's first
of all take a look

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.830
at the life cycle of this
virus, and then we'll

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:40.550
move on to dealing with the
issue of the segmentation.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:45.740
So here's a typical enveloped
virus with a capsid.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:50.300
Inside, there's the
negative-stranded RNA that gets

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.850
into the host cell,
and you make--

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:58.130
and you dump into the host
cell the viral genomic RNA.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.230
That can get copied.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.700
The minus-strand RNA gets
copied to the plus-strand RNA,

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.120
which becomes the messenger for
protein synthesis in the cell.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.700
So you've gone in
with minus strand.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.090
You've made the plus strand,
which is the messenger,

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:16.430
and that encodes all
the proteins that

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.170
are needed for a new virus.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.900
And some of those proteins
may have signal sequences.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.900
They may be shipped to
the surface of the cell,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.980
and they may be planted in
the outside cellular membrane

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.420
of the host cells.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.050
And what you see here is
copies of those proteins

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.970
actually in the
surface of a cell.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.170
So what happens with this
virus is, once all the moving

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:46.490
parts are made, they congregate
at the surface of a cell,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.010
get packaged, and then
bud off from the cell.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.990
So remember all the rules you
learned about where proteins

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.110
end up in the cell are
all good still here

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.580
because the capsid proteins
have to get to a cell membrane,

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.220
so they're translated
with a signal sequence.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.150
They congregate-- I don't know
how this self-assembly occurs,

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:12.020
but it's a fascinating
process, so that ultimately you

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.370
bud off an intact virion
from the host cell.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.220
But the key thing that
the virus has to have

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.930
is something that will
copy negative-stranded RNA

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:27.840
to plus-stranded RNA, which
is going to be the messenger.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.760
So the virus also has to code
for a particular protein that's

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.890
unique to its lifestyle.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:38.360
So it has an RA-dependent
RNA polymerase.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.900
We don't use an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:45.890
but the virus needs it to
take its negative-strand RNA

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.590
to a plus-strand RNA, which
will be the messenger.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:49.760
So does that make sense?

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.920
So obviously,
that's a moving part

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.690
that it needs to
provide to the host.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:58.700
Now, what's this about segmented
viruses that's quite important?

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.740
Oh, and I just want
to underscore here,

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.500
what defines the destination
of these proteins,

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.380
whether they're capsid
proteins or proteins that

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.930
are going to be packaged
within the virus,

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.210
is basically just
the same rules that

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.460
apply that we talked
about when we talked

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.790
about protein trafficking.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.820
So every year,
there's a whole panic.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.480
Did you get your flu shot?

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.000
Is it going to work this year?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.370
Oh my god, millions of
people are going to get sick.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.390
Go get your flu shot.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.490
It's tetravalent, it's
trivalent, and so on.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.300
So what we're trying
to do every year

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.430
is predict what the virus
is going to look like.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.440
So we have to--

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.770
there are teams of people,
who sometimes get it wrong,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:47.170
who predict the
variation in these genes.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.780
And they look at winter in
the Southern Hemisphere,

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.610
because that
precedes us, and try

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.520
to guess what's going to happen
in winter in the Northern

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.420
Hemisphere.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.190
And we get to try and put
together a vaccination package.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.940
But the problem with the
viral influenza virus

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:10.190
is that there can be not
just a drift, like mutations,

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:13.100
small mutations happening
a little bit at a time,

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.850
but there can be
recombination of the genes,

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:21.770
because they are segmented,
into totally new virus particles

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.960
that have different properties.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.700
So viruses don't just drift
in their genomic sequence.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.130
They can have dramatic shifts
in their sequences that occur--

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.310
whoops-- through combinations
of viruses that come-- that

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.450
have infected different animals.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.300
So some of the
common strains, when

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.360
we talk about certain strains
that have been very, very

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.710
troublesome to humans, may
result from such a combination.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:54.170
So this would be the Eurasian
pig flu, the classic pig flu,

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.810
the human flu, the bird flu.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:00.370
If, in certain communities
where people often

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.040
live with their
livestock, a cell

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.430
gets infected with
viruses, a human virus

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:11.200
and the swine virus, they
can mix and match together.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.620
And you can make a totally
different viral composition,

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.520
where you've got one piece
of genetic information

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.880
from the swine flu and seven
more from the human flu.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.910
And what that can
suddenly mean is

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.630
that the-- first of all, the
vaccines don't work at all,

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.690
but that they may have very,
very different properties

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.910
for infectivity.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.780
The protein that is
expressed that may cause

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.870
that very first attack of
the virus on your cells

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:44.440
in the upper lungs may be
very different to the type--

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.720
to the protein that
comes from the swine flu

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.590
and may give you much more
serious lung infections

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.870
because they can go
deeper into the lungs.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.050
So it can be very small
changes by pulling

00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:00.840
an enzyme, a piece of gene, from
a completely different organism

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.640
and matching it up with
the rest of the genes

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.480
from the human virus that
makes for dramatic shifts

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.990
in viral infections
that cause these sorts

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:13.870
of sudden tectonic
shifts where we've really

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.880
got to deal with a virus.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.560
There are two terms up here.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.740
There's H and N. These
are hemagglutinin and

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.120
neuraminidase.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.240
They are two proteins that
are in the viral coat,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.400
so you'll often hear viruses
referred to as H1N1, H3N3,

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.430
and it's just the variant
of those proteins that

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.330
are in the viruses.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.980
See these little terms here--

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.370
that's what that means,
what type of hemagglutinin,

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.790
what type of neuraminidase, is
on the surface of the virus.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.700
So I am done for
today, and next class

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.660
will be exclusively about the
AIDS-HIV virus, where we'll

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.450
go into that life
cycle and also talk

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.780
about resistance to therapeutic
agents and combination

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.630
therapies.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.320
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.650
Today we try to wrap up
our present discussion

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.620
of partial derivatives by means
of a rather practical example,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.110
which not only has
wide application

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.320
but which ties in many of
the individual principles

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.510
that we've talked about in the
last two blocks of material.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.640
The particular topic
that I have in mind today

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.900
is the topic known as the theory
of maxima/minima of functions

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.770
in several variables.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.090
You see, in part
one of our course

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.740
we studied the
special case where

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.840
we had a function from the real
numbers into the real numbers.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.330
And what we were
looking for were

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.420
values of the independent
variable for which f

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.920
was either maximum or minimum.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.600
And so a natural extension of
this is simply the following:

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.110
given a real-valued function
of several real variables--

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.670
in other words, assume that f
is a mapping from n-dimensional

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.660
space into the real numbers, f
is a function from E^n into E.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.560
Then the n-tuple a bar, in E sub
n, is called a local maximum--

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.140
and I suppose we might as
kill two birds with one stone

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.370
here and put in the
definition for a local minimum

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.710
at the same time.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.530
It's called a local
maximum of f if and only

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.510
if there exists a neighborhood
n of a bar such that f of a bar

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.940
is greater than or equal to
f of x bar for every x bar

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.310
in the neighborhood.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.990
I suppose, by the
way, while we're

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.290
at this, for a local minimum
the condition would be what?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.600
For a local minimum,
instead of f of a bar

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.020
being greater than or equal to f
of x bar, it would be less than

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.270
or equal to.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.700
In other words,
what you're saying

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.740
is that what you mean by a
local high point or low point

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.450
is what?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.610
That in a neighborhood
of the point in question,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.260
for example, if
that output exceeds

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.130
every other possible output
in a sufficiently small

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.000
neighborhood, then we say
that that particular input

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.080
is the local maximum.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.530
And a similar definition
for local minimum.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.540
In other words,
again, keep in mind

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.590
that this is
precisely and almost

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.740
a word-for-word translation
of what the terms relative

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.050
maximum and relative minimum
or local max and local min

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.210
meant for functions of
a single real variable.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.310
Consequently, except for the
fact that in several variables

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.850
it's much more difficult
to describe domains because

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.730
of all the degrees of
freedom that you have,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.990
one would expect that these same
particular tests for membership

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.370
would occur for functions
of several variables

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.020
when we're looking for high-low
points or max-min points

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.320
as in the case of one
independent variable.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.150
So let's just very
quickly summarize this.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.360
How do we test for candidates
for max-min points?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.780
Now, the idea is simply
this, that if we're

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.840
going to have a relative
high or a relative low point,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.730
think of the thing graphically.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.820
If you take a cross section
with respect to any one

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.240
of the independent variables.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.150
In other words, if you look at
f as a function just of x_1,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.370
say, and hold x_2
up to x_n constant,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.960
then when w is viewed as
a function of x_1 alone,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.120
then one would expect
that you have what?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.360
That just in the w,x_1-plane,
you must have a candidate,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.920
which means that one would
expect that if you took

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.590
the partial of f with respect
to x_1, that must be 0.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.960
Similarly, the partial
of f with respect to x_2

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.490
must be 0, et cetera.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.630
The partial of f with
respect to x sub n must be 0.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.280
In other words, to find a
candidate for a max-min point,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.120
notice that right
off the bat we're

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.269
back to a practical application
of the study of systems

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.470
of several equations
in several unknowns.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.000
Namely, we must solve
the systems of equations

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.470
the partial of f with respect
to x_1 equals 0, et cetera,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.250
the partial of f with
respect to x_n equals 0.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.460
Find simultaneous
solutions, whenever

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.160
such simultaneous
solutions exist.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.950
Now of course, there may
be points in our domain

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.380
where the partials
don't exist, just

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.170
like there was in the case of
calculus of a single variable.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.410
In other words, the second thing
we do in testing for candidates

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.160
is we find points in the domain
where f is not differentiable.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.970
For example, f might
not be continuous.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.530
f might not be defined.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.200
Whatever the reason
is, we look to see

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.160
where f is not differentiable.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.210
And all points in the domain at
which f is not differentiable,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.030
they also become candidates
for max-min points.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.920
And thirdly, we check the
boundary of the domain of f.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.810
In other words,
if the domain of f

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.890
happens to be a
two-dimensional region,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.190
we check the boundary
of the region.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.730
Again, the reason being
the same as in the calculus

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.390
of a single real variable.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.730
If a function is
differentiable, it

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.290
must take on its maximum
and minimum values

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.540
some place, if
the domain happens

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.140
to be a closed set, in
other words, a connected set

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.320
with a boundary.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.160
And we won't go into
that in any more

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.420
detail at this particular time.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.900
But essentially, what do we do?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.670
We look at the function
wherever it's differentiable,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.440
take all of its partials,
set them equal to 0,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.790
solve that system simultaneously
to see what values of x_1

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.180
up to x_n give us permissible
candidates for max-min points,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.280
we check to see where the
derivative does not exist,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.250
and that gives us
another batch of points,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.110
and then we check
the boundary values

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.900
to see if anything
peculiar happens there.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.010
Same three tests as we had for
calculus of a single variable.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.090
And why is this
so closely allied

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.700
to calculus of a
single variable?

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.560
Well, if we take
the case n equals 2,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.000
we again get a nice
geometric interpretation.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.570
Namely, if w is a
function of x and y,

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.700
notice again our
notation for what

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.980
happens when we have two
independent variables.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.040
They're called x and
y, and usually we

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.740
let the dependent variable
be w in that case.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.320
Let's take a look and see
what happens over here.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.800
Suppose, for the
sake of argument,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.030
that we know that we
have a relative low point

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.080
corresponding to
the input a comma b.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.990
In other words, suppose we
know that f of a comma b

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.560
is the lowest value of f, the
lowest height on the surface,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.840
in a sufficiently small
neighborhood of the point

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.990
a comma b.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.160
All I'm saying is this:
take any slice whatsoever,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.260
any plane through the point a
comma b, pick any direction s.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.720
Take that plane
perpendicular to the xy-plane

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.850
in the s direction,
and slice the surface w

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.260
equals f of x, y
with that plane,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.640
and we get a slice
something like this.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.550
Not something like this, this
is the slice that we get.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.670
Now, let's take a look at
where that low point is.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.750
Since that is to be a low
point in the entire region,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.310
obviously it must be a
low point, in particular,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.390
with respect to the
particular slice that we took.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.420
How could it be the
lowest point every place

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.400
if it's not the lowest
point with respect

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.120
to any particular slice?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.580
And all we're saying
then is that with respect

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.980
to this slice, notice that
w is a function of s alone.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.140
In other words, we can
talk about the directional

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.050
derivative df/ds.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.630
And again, all we're saying is
that directional derivative,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.270
df/ds, evaluated at
the point a comma b,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.730
must be 0 for all directions s.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.140
And as we have seen
throughout our course,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.390
if f happens to be a
continuously differentiable

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.060
function of the
variables x_1 up to x_n,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.560
then the directional derivative
is determined completely

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.220
by our knowledge of the partials
with respect to x_1 up to x_n.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.060
And you see, as far as
the theory is concerned,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.680
that's all there is to it.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.060
As the cliche goes,
the rest is commentary.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.330
Now what kind of
commentary do I mean?

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.640
Well, among other
things, once we

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.830
have located all the particular
max-min candidates-- see,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.140
notice why I call these
things candidates.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.710
All we're saying
is that wherever

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.559
the system of
possible derivatives,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.930
setting them equal
to 0, yields a value,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.410
that point is simply a
candidate for a max-min point.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.160
Just, again, like in the
calculus of a single variable.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.855
If f prime of a is 0, we cannot
conclude that a is a local max

00:08:56.855 --> 00:08:58.930
or a local min. it
might be a saddle point,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.260
a stationary point where
the thing just levels off.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.650
It's just that once
we have the candidate,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.870
how do we test whether it
really is a max or a min?

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.290
Well, what we have to do is,
looking at f of a comma b,

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.240
we have to see whether that's
the lowest possible value

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.200
or the highest possible
value in a sufficiently small

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.390
neighborhood of that point.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.400
Well, how do you characterize
a neighborhood of the point?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.950
You look at some nearby point,
which we can denote as what?

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.560
a plus h comma b plus k.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.610
As if this h and k
seem strange to you,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.800
notice that h is often
what we call delta x,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.330
and k is what we
often call delta y.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.170
In other words, we look at some
nearby point, a plus delta x

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.360
comma b plus delta y.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.540
And what we're saying
is that if this

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.140
is to be, for
example, a high point,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.850
it means that when you
compute this difference,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.920
this difference had better
be negative all the time.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.140
Because when you look at this
particular thing over here,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.220
if this is to be the
greatest possible value

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.004
in a neighborhood
when you subtract it

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.670
from something else
in the neighborhood,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.410
you should get a negative value.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.790
In other words, to put it
in still other terms, what

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.740
we're saying is that to--
let's just read this again.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.430
Once a max-min candidate
a comma b is found,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.450
we must investigate the sign
of f of a plus h comma b

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.080
plus k minus f of a, b for
all sufficiently small values

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.965
of h and k.

00:10:28.965 --> 00:10:30.110
OK?

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.270
That's for all sufficiently
small values of h of k,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.150
which can be messy.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.040
I don't mean that.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.695
I mean for all sufficiently
small values of h and k,

00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:39.070
in other words,
in a neighborhood

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.710
of the point a comma b.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.360
And what I'm saying is that
this particular computation

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.470
can itself be very messy.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.970
You see?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.170
This is, again, going back
to this idea of how we

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.520
invert equations and the like.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.260
It's difficult to compute f
of a plus h comma b plus k,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.140
in general, if f is
a messy function,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.664
if f is a computationally
complicated thing.

00:10:59.664 --> 00:11:01.830
And not only that, but we
may have several unknowns,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.310
more than two unknowns.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.150
And you see, this was
true in one variable.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.610
We saw in the case of one
variable that, technically

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.930
speaking, to test
whether f of a was

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.540
a high point of a
low point, we had

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.160
to look at f of a plus h minus
f of a for all sufficiently

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.630
small values of h.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.810
And that could have been
a messy computation too.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.260
Of course, the thing that
happened in the single variable

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.010
that was very helpful to
us was that in the case

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.390
of a single variable,
we were often

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.130
able to use f double
prime of a as a hint.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.870
In other words, whenever
f double prime of a

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.250
wasn't equal to 0, we can
conclude, or could conclude,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.580
whether f of a was
a max or min, once

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.280
we know that f prime of a was 0.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.430
Remember, that was
that holding water

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.100
versus spilling water routine.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.980
If f double prime
of a was positive,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.190
that meant that the
curve was holding water.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.410
Holding water meant that
you had a minimum value.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.000
If f double prime
of a was negative,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.160
that meant that the
curve was spilling water.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.329
And spilling water
yielded a maximum value.

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:09.620
And the only problem was, is
when the second derivative

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.577
was 0, in which case
the test failed.

00:12:12.577 --> 00:12:14.160
What did it mean
that the test failed?

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.990
When f double prime of
a was 0, the only way

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.030
we could test to see
whether a was a max or a min

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.870
on neither, meaning
a saddle point,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.320
what was to actually look at
f of a plus h minus f of a

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.050
and see what happened
in that particular case.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.320
Now, one would like to believe
that an analogous result held

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.520
for the case of
several real variables,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.860
in particular for the case
of two independent variables.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.960
The point is that in a
manner of speaking, it does.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.980
But in another
manner of speaking,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.300
things are much more
complicated than what

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.120
happened in the case of
one independent variable.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.950
In particular, what goes
wrong is the following,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.440
and that is that the
second derivative,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.940
in the case of two
independent variables,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.400
involves three
separate partials.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.290
See what do you mean
by a second derivative?

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.600
You mean you must
differentiate something twice.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.630
Well, you could've
differentiated

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.250
the function twice with respect
to x at the point a comma b.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.280
That's what we mean
by f sub xx, recall.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.950
Or you might have differentiated
first with respect

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.270
to x and then with respect
to y, in which case

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.870
it would have been f
sub xy of a comma b.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.300
In fact, I should
be careful here.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.883
There should be a
fourth one here too,

00:13:25.883 --> 00:13:28.240
and that is f sub y,x.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.490
Namely, first differentiate
with respect to y and then

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.740
with respect to x.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.680
The reason I left
that out over here

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.780
was simply because, if we
have a nice function, meaning

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.810
one that's continuous, and the
derivatives are continuous,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.360
and the mixed derivatives
exist and are continuous,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.550
we showed that the
order in which we

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.740
take the partials made no
difference, that f sub xy

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.730
was equal to f sub yx.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.640
But getting back to this
idea, the third possibility

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.580
is that you can have
differentiated twice

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.170
with respect to y and formed
and f sub yy of a comma b.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.150
And so the question is, with all
of these different second-order

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.770
partial derivatives
floating around,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.560
what do you mean by the
second partial derivative?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.880
And the key
expression, and I think

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.810
this is far from intuitive,
but the key expression

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.860
turns out to be that the
determining factor is

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.200
the second partial with
respect to x, in other words f

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.730
sub xx, multiplied by the second
partial with respect to y, f

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:33.200
sub yy, minus the square
of the mixed partial.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.830
And that particular factor,
the sine of that factor,

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.830
determines whether you have a
maximum point, a minimum point,

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.270
a saddle point, or else
the test might fail.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.840
By the way, this is a rather
difficult proof to come by.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.040
The proof is done in chapter
18 of the Thomas text,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.270
and is assigned for you.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.300
I tried to give you learning
exercises that take you

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.320
through the proof step by step.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.540
And I have also included an
optional supplementary lecture

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.370
for those of you who may still
have difficulty following

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.660
both the text and the
supplementary notes

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.210
and the learning exercises,
because it's all written out

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.090
and might like to
hear the thing spoken.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.140
What I will do is
derive this for you

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.570
in an optional lecture for
those of you who want it.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.170
But for the time being,
to give us our overview,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.790
let me simply state
what the properties

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.220
of this particular quantity are.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.900
That the main result-- and as I
just write here to remind you,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.580
that the details
are derived later,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.290
both in the text, in
the learning exercises,

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:39.220
and in an optional lecture--
that suppose we have solved

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.220
our simultaneous
system and have found

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.670
points a comma b,
where the partial

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.570
of f with respect to x and the
partial of f with respect to y

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.820
equals 0.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.790
So we now have a
candidate, meaning

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.120
a comma b now is eligible to be
tested to see whether it yields

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.790
a maximum or a minimum value.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:04.190
The test turns out to be this,
you compute f sub xx times

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:10.330
f sub yy minus f sub xy
squared at the point a comma b.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.680
And if that particular number
turns out to be greater than 0,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.930
then a comma b yields
a local minimum

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:25.230
of f if f sub xx
happens to be positive,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:30.740
and a local maximum if f sub
xx happens to be negative.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.800
Now, the easiest
way to remember that

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.430
is to think in terms of a
partial derivative, again.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.620
Imagine that we've sliced the
surface so that we're looking

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.440
at a cut in the wx-plane.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.360
In the wx-plane, notice that
if the second derivative of w

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.800
with respect to x
is positive, that

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.070
means that the curve
is holding water.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.270
And holding water seems to
indicate a minimum, you see.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.050
And similarly, if it's
negative it's spilling water,

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.630
and that would
indicate a maximum.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.750
You might say, what happens
if f sub xx happens to be 0.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.510
And the answer is, lookit,
if f sub xx happens to be 0,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.210
this case couldn't have
occurred in the first place,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.480
because if f sub
xx happens to be 0,

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.480
this term drops
out, in which case

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.280
this could not be a
positive expression.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.630
With this term missing, the
smallest the square can be

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:37.200
is 0, and a negative of a
positive or non-zero number

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.430
can't be negative.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.780
In other words, you could
not obey this inequality

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.967
if f sub xx happened to be 0.

00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:44.550
If you want to argue,
why couldn't you

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:49.350
look at f sub yy instead of f
sub xx, the answer is, f sub xx

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.630
and f sub yy must both
have the same sign.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.340
Because if we just
look at this thing,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.880
notice that this term
has to be positive.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.160
You're subtracting off
something positive,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.120
therefore the term
you're subtracting from

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.340
must be positive.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.270
And the only way the product
of two numbers can be positive

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.370
is if each of the factors
has the same sign.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.490
But again, I don't
want to belabor that.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.670
I just want to go through this
thing fairly rapidly with you.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.820
It turns out, by the way, if
this key factor, this key term,

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.610
f sub xx f sub yy minus the
square of the mixed partial,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.000
happens to be negative,
then you can be sure

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.600
that you have a saddle point.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.230
In other words,
what that means is

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.390
for any neighborhood
of the point

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:36.080
a comma b, for some values of
f, for some values of x comma

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.290
y in that neighborhood, the
function will be greater than f

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.520
of a comma b, and for others
it will be less than f

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.390
of a comma b.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.640
So it's neither a max nor a min.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.880
And it turns out that the
situation in which to test

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.460
fails is if this particular
expression happens to equal 0.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.530
So again, you see that from
a purely mechanical point

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.180
of view, this test is
rather easy to memorize.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.305
The hard part is the proof.

00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:04.680
And that's why,
as I say, there's

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.750
extra drill on that part, if you
happen to be interested in it.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.060
And by the way, if you're
not interested in it,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.490
skip the proof.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.020
In fact, for the
sake of this course,

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.930
I am not concerned with how well
you handle max-min problems.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.390
I'm interested more
in showing you overall

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.090
what max-min
problems mean and how

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.520
all of the principles of
partial differentiation

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.320
seem to come up in that
particular application

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.040
of max-min problems.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.960
So from a theoretical
point of view,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.580
that would complete
the study of how

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.260
one handles max-min problems,
except that an even more

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.050
difficult and subtle form
of computational difficulty

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.440
comes up, in terms of some
of the practical applications

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.990
that we have, which
motivate such mechanical and

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.425
computational devices
known as, for example,

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:59.010
the Lagrange multipliers and
things of this sort that,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.550
again, are discussed in the text
and in the learning exercises

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.850
and which I will not discuss
in the lecture, other

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.440
than to motivate for
you why they occur.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.570
And let me just finish up
today's lesson in terms of one

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.620
more topic.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.510
And this is a bad
name for this topic,

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.800
because we've already used this
word in a different context.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.170
But this very often
happens in mathematics,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.020
that the same word is used
in more than one context.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.300
But one often talks
about constraints

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.400
when one deals with functions
of several variables.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.190
In other words,
in many cases when

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.980
one wants to
maximize or minimize

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.100
a function of
several variables, it

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.870
turns out that certain
external conditions

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.510
happen to be imposed.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.540
Now, if that sounds like
a difficult mouthful

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.490
to comprehend, I would
like to start off

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.540
with an example that's
already occurred

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.250
in a max-min problem in
part one of our course,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.470
but in such a subtle
way that we never

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.960
noticed that it was really
involving a function

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.220
of several variables.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.291
In fact, if it hadn't
have been that subtle,

00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:00.040
we'd have been in
trouble, because in part

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.570
one of our course, we did
not talk about functions

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.270
of more than one real variable.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.060
But for example, let's revisit
a type of problem that says

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.270
let's find the minimum
distance, say, from the origin,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.230
0 comma 0, the minimum distance
from the origin to the curve

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.960
x*y equals 1.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.030
Well, to find that
minimum distance,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.400
notice that what we have to
do is minimize a distance

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.970
function, namely the
square of the distance--

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.160
I use the square simply to
eliminate the square root

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.530
sign here-- the square of
the distance from the origin

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.490
to any point x comma y is
x squared plus y squared.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.720
Well, notice that
in this form, this

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.220
is a function of two
independent variables.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.860
The trouble is, you don't want
the distance from the origin

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.180
to any old point.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.380
The point that you're
investigating has to be

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.950
on the curve x*y equals 1.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.410
And that means that x and
y, for your investigation

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.710
in this problem,
are not independent.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.680
Namely, x and y are related.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.540
Now by the way, sometimes this
equation can be so messy that

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.000
we cannot solve for y
explicitly in terms of x.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.200
In this particular case,
as long as x is not 0,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.850
we can solve specifically for
y in terms of x, in which case

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.140
we get y equals 1 over x.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.890
And that is, in
this particular case

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.840
then, the function that
we want to minimize,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.880
even though it looks
like a function of two

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.510
independent variables,
is really a function

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.050
of one independent
variable, because since y

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.850
is equal to 1 over x in our
investigation, f of x comma y

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.650
is really f of x comma 1 over x.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.040
In other words, going back
to what f is explicitly

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.570
in this case, f of x comma y
is just x squared plus 1 over x

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.970
quantity squared.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.970
And that in turn is also
just a function of x.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.310
Now you see, what makes
this thing more difficult

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.300
is, first of all, we may not be
dealing with a function of just

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.300
two variables to minimize.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.280
And secondly, we may have a very
difficult constraint imposed.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.190
Or what makes things
even more difficult

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.270
is that if we have to
minimize a function,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.010
say, a five variables, there
may be two or three or even

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.780
four constraints imposed.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.420
And the question is, how
do you maximize or minimize

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.220
a function, taking
into consideration

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.570
the fact that there are
constraints imposed?

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.940
And this is what brings up
all of the type of material

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.110
that I gave you as
exercises in the last unit,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.450
where we talked about
the Jacobian matrix,

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.890
and handled the
inverting systems,

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.130
and how we could solve
explicitly or implicitly

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.490
for functions, implicit
function theorems,

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.470
things that we talked
about in those exercises.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.830
All of those things come up
in solving max-min problems

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.110
in several unknowns.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.990
See, more generally,
what we're saying

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.540
is we have more
variables than two,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.380
and we have more
implicit constraints,

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.120
meaning more constraints than
just a single constraint,

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.560
and also using more variables,
and also more involving

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.630
modifying implicit that
you just can't solve

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.290
for one of the
variables explicitly

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.120
in terms of the other,
even though there

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.290
is an implicit
relationship involved.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.880
Now, I hate to work
abstractly in general,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.430
but in this particular
lecture I'm going to do that.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.850
I'm going to talk with
you abstractly here,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.480
but all of the exercises will
deal with concrete situations

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.910
so that you'll see all
of the theory come alive

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.920
in the problems.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.370
But because I want to give
you the material as compactly

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.370
as possible, let me just
state what the situation is.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.680
For example, suppose we
want to maximize or minimize

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.790
a function of what appears to
be three independent variables,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.770
say, f of x, y, z.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.450
And all of a sudden,
somebody tells us,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.290
hey, in the domain that we're
interested in, x, y, and z

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.570
are not independent.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.150
There's a certain constraint.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.300
And let's write
that symbolically

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.340
as some function of
x, y, and z equals 0.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.190
Remember, that's
simply our abstract way

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.170
of saying that there is some
functional relationship that

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.280
relates x, y, and z.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.440
And we'll simply call that
g of x, y, z equals 0.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.840
Maybe I could solve for z
explicitly in terms of x and y

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.520
from this particular
relationship.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.780
Maybe I can.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.230
But at any rate, what we
do know from the learning

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.340
exercises of last time,
that g of x, y, z equals 0,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.330
will implicitly define z as
some function of x and y,

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.960
say k of x, y,
except in that case

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.060
where the partial of g with
respect to z happens to be 0.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.110
And I put this thing
in parentheses for you

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.370
simply to give you
motivation to review

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.250
the exercises of last time if
this seems a bit vague to you.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.050
At any rate, what this
thing means in plain English

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.750
is that subject
to the constraint,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.830
that z is some
function of x and y.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.350
We take this constraint,
we put that back

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:54.590
into our original function
that we're trying to maximize.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:00.300
Notice that f of x, y, z now
becomes f of x, y, k of x, y.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.140
See? z is k of x, y.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.200
If we now look at
this expression,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.780
notice only x and y appear, so
that subject to the constraint

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.990
g of x, y, z equals
0, the function f

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.710
is a function of only two
independent variables,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.720
not three.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.992
And to indicate that, let's
simply say that f of x, y,

00:26:21.992 --> 00:26:25.130
z-- f of x, y, k of
x, y in this case--

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.950
is some function h of x and y.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.680
And what our problem
is now saying

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.190
is, minimize or
maximize the function

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.890
h, which is a function of
two independent variables.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.720
Now notice here--
it's been quite a

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.050
while since we've dealt
with the chain rule--

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.180
but notice here that the
chain rule now comes up

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.960
in a very important practical
application, namely,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.020
this looks like an eyesore
f of x, y comma k of x, y.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.500
How can we handle that?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.330
Notice that another
way of saying this,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.664
utilizing the chain rule, is
to say h of x, y is f of x, y,

00:27:00.664 --> 00:27:05.376
z where z is some
function k of x and y.

00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:08.160
See, f is a function
of x, y and z,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.225
and z is a function of x and y.

00:27:10.225 --> 00:27:12.100
In fact, if you wanted
to say it another way,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.310
you could say what?

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:18.490
f is some function of x, y, z,
where x equals x, y equals y,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.120
and z equals k of x, y.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.620
You see?

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.620
That's your
particular chain rule.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.820
Now, lookit.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.610
See, this is, again, one of
the problems of mathematics,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.400
which I hope is crystal
clear by this time.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.000
Granted, that we discussed
the chain rule in block three.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.290
That's no reason why in
block four we can beg off

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.711
and say, we had a long time
ago, I don't remember that.

00:27:39.711 --> 00:27:40.210
No.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.060
Hopefully, we've made
the chain rule so clear

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.640
that any time I tell you
that we have to invoke it,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.190
you can just write it
down very, very quickly.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.050
How does the chain
rule work now?

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.770
To differentiate
this with respect

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.060
to x, say, we take
the partial of this

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.760
with respect to x, times the
partial of x with respect to x,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.490
plus the partial
of f with respect

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.690
to y times the partial
of y with respect

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.990
to x, plus the partial of
f with respect to z times

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.700
the partial of z
with respect to x.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.800
In other words, the general
theory hasn't changed at all.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.914
To maximize or minimize
h, what we're going to do

00:28:14.914 --> 00:28:17.080
is we're going to take the
partial of h with respect

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.150
to x and set that
equal to 0, we're

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.780
going to take the partial
of h with respect to y

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.900
and set that equal
to 0, and solve

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.860
that system simultaneously.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.820
But the hard point
computationally

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.160
is, sure, you can say let's
set the partials is equal to 0.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.370
But before you can do
that, you had better

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.600
be able to take the partials.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.170
And that's where the
computationally skill comes in.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.780
So how do we take the partial
of h with respect to x here?

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.300
Well, we just said that.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.280
The partial of h with respect
to x, using the chain rule,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.020
is f sub x times the partial
of x with respect to x, plus f

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.600
sub y times the partial of y
with respect to x, plus f sub

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.390
z times the partial of
z with respect to x.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.460
Now notice that the partial
of x with respect to x is 1.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.740
So that gives me f
sub x over there.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.650
Keep in mind that whereas z
is a function of x and y--

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.490
let's go back here and take
a quick look at that-- notice

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.140
that in our function
h, we're assuming what?

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.050
That x and y are the
independent variables,

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:20.100
but that z is a
function of x and y.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.860
The point, therefore,
is that since x and y

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.680
are independent
variables, by definition

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.580
that means that the partial
of y with respect to x is 0.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.510
In other words, the fact
that y and x are independent

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.280
means that the change in y
with respect to a change in x

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.850
is 0, because we can change
x without changing y.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.010
And finally, given
that z is k of x, y,

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.400
we can compute the partial
of z with respect to x.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.055
And so, what we wind up with
is that the partial of h

00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:51.460
with respect to x is the
partial of f with respect to x,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:57.020
plus the partial of f
with respect to z times

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.830
the partial of z with respect x.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.210
And we must set that equal to 0.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.240
Again, leaving the details to
you as a review of the chain

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.750
rule.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.090
In a similar way, we show that
the partial of h with respect

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.390
to y is the partial of
f with respect to y,

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.570
plus the partial of
f with respect to z,

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.860
times the partial of
z with respect to x,

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.670
and we set that equal to 0.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.110
Now, the thing to keep in mind
is to observe that f of x, y, z

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.380
was a given function.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.020
We know what that looks like.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.580
Consequently, these four
quantities are known.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.360
The trouble is that
g of x, y, z equals 0

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.940
defines z implicitly as
a function of x and y.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.770
And consequently,
if it turns out

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.410
that we could not have
solved our system for z

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.740
explicitly in terms of x
and y, the question mark

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.701
would be, for example--

00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:49.200
I'm sorry.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.850
This is a misprint over here.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.090
This should be, of course,
the partial of-- we're

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.800
differentiate with respect to y.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.010
This is the partial of
f with respect to y,

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.430
plus the partial of
f with respect to z,

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.710
times the partial of
z with respect to y.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.500
The key point over here is
simply that we must know what?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.410
If we can't solve for z
explicitly in terms of x and y,

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.040
how do we know what
these two quantities are?

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.350
We only know them implicitly.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.460
And this gives us
our review, again,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.090
of setting differentials
equal to 0 and the like.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.610
Namely, if g of x, y,
z is identically 0,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.580
we can equate the derivative
on both sides to 0.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.780
And to differentiate
this thing implicitly,

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.690
it's, again, using the
chain rule, we get what?

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.720
The partial of g with respect
to x, plus the partial

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.025
of g with respect to z,
times the partial of z

00:31:40.025 --> 00:31:42.010
with respect to x is 0.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.410
Notice, by the way, that
g is given explicitly.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.600
We're told what the function
g of x, y, z looks like.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.400
Consequently, these
things here are known.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.630
And we can now solve for the
partial of z with respect to x.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.570
In fact, what is the partial
of z with respect to x?

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.770
That's nothing more than what?

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.450
It's minus the partial
of g with respect

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.740
to x divided by the partial
of g with respect to z.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.430
And that's why the partial
of g with respect to z

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.990
had better not be 0, otherwise
we wind up in trouble here.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.000
Similarly, we can find what the
partial of z with respect to y

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.630
is.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.150
That's going to
turn out to be what?

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.820
Minus the partial
of g with respect

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.860
to y divided by the partial
of g with respect to z.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.780
Knowing what these two values
are from these two equations,

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.900
we come back into the here.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.430
And now we know what
these are, and now

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.550
we simply have all of
the known functions

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.890
on the right-hand side,
and we solve this system.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.580
Now hopefully, this
is one of the times

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.390
I hope things don't
sound too clear to you,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.570
meaning you have an
overview, but you

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.030
begin to suspect that this
is a very messy situation.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.480
Because, you see, what
I wanted you to see

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.250
is that solving such
a system like this

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.980
can be extremely cumbersome.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.710
And that's why, in the
exercises, we do two things.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.740
We have to solve
systems like this

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.160
to get the experience
of seeing that there's

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.330
a big difference between
knowing theoretically

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.880
how to solve a
system of equations

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.160
and knowing pragmatically
how to carry it out.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.110
And secondly, we hope that
some of these computations

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.140
become cumbersome enough
so that you practically

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.530
beg to find some shortcuts.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.170
Because if you're not
begging to find a shortcut,

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.620
then such things as
Lagrange multipliers

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.490
and the like, which
are techniques

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.310
for solving max-min problems
subject to constraints,

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.180
that those shortcuts
don't appeal to you

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.920
and you fail to see
their significance,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.080
and you say, why do I have
to learn these things.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.180
Don't I have enough
problems without it?

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.300
You see, again, notice the
difference between what's

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.510
happening here
abstractly and what's

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.010
happening computationally.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.150
Abstractly, the
theory of max-min

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.110
is not that difficult. But
computationally, to handle it,

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.890
you have to be extremely
adept at handling systems

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.450
of n equations and n
unknowns, not necessarily

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.690
linear equations, being
able to throw in constraints

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.409
and seeing what's
happening here.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:15.370
And at any rate, that's
what the learning exercises

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.929
will be all about, and
the material in the text.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.719
And I think that's enough
of a mouthful for this time.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.650
So until next time, good bye.

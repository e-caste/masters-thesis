00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:26.960
PROFESSOR: I'm Ernst Frankel.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.430
I'll be teaching
next two lectures.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.030
I'd like to encourage you to
contact me outside of class

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.990
if you have any questions,
if you want to meet.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.045
And also, please, during
class, ask questions.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:38.420
It's a somewhat impersonal
setting with the video cameras

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.270
and the amphitheater, but
hopefully we can overcome that.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.470
This unit is going to focus
on moving across scales

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.392
in computational
biology, looking

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:49.850
from computational
issues that deal

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.260
with the fundamentals of protein
structure at the atomic level

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.695
to the level of protein-protein
interactions between pairs

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:59.760
of molecules, protein
DNA interactions

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.630
and small molecules,
and then ultimately

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.700
into protein network.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.640
So we've got a lot
of ground to cover,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.460
but I think we'll be able do it.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.410
As you've seen in the syllabus,
the first couple of lectures

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.190
are really a detailed
look at protein structure,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.230
molecular level
analysis, and then we'll

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.540
move into some of these
other levels of higher

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.910
order, including protein
DNA interactions and gene

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.790
regulatory networks.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.730
I think may of you are probably
familiar with this quote,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.910
that "nothing in
biology makes sense

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.770
except in the light
of evolution."

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.310
And I'd like to offer a
modified version of that, which

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.050
is little in biology make sense
except in light of structure,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.887
protein structure,
DNA structure.

00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:43.470
We've, of course, seen this very
early on in molecular biology

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.410
when the structure of DNA was
solved, and immediately became

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.870
clear why it was the
basis for heredity.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.200
But protein structures have been
even more lasting impact time

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.957
and time again, many,
many more events,

00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:59.040
which have really
revolutionized the understanding

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.020
of particular
biological problems.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.050
So one example that was
stunning at the time

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.520
had to do with the most
frequently mutated protein

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.300
in cancer.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.070
This is the p53 gene.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.870
It's mutated in about
half of all cancers,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.435
and what was observed
early on-- this

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.143
was in the days before
genomic sequencing

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:18.310
when it was actually
very expensive and hard

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.860
to identify mutations in tumors.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.900
So they focused on
this particular gene,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.960
and they observed that
the mutations clustered.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.835
So this is the structure of
the gene from the n-terminus--

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:30.960
the protein from the
n-terminus and the c-terminus,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.081
and the bars indicate the
frequency of mutations.

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.330
And you can see that they're
all clustered pretty much

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.910
in the center of this molecule.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.680
Now, why is that?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.380
It was enigmatic until the
structure was solved here

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.217
at MIT by Carl Pabo
and his post-doc

00:02:44.217 --> 00:02:46.950
at the time, Nikola Pavletich,
and they showed, actually,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.320
that these correspond
to critical domains.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.870
And in a second
paper, they actually

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.400
showed why the mutations occur
in those particular locations.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.590
So if you look at the
plot on the upper left,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.520
here's the protein
sequence; above it,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.300
the frequency of
mutations; below it,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.990
the secondary
structure elements.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.720
And you'll see that
mutations occur

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.010
in regions that don't have any
regular secondary structure

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.570
and can occur
frequently in regions

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.081
with secondary
structure or not all

00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:16.580
in regions with
secondary structure.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.038
So the mere fact that there's
a secondary structure element

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:21.314
does not define why
there're mutations.

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:22.980
But when the
three-dimensional structure

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.817
was solved in the
complex with DNA,

00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:26.650
over here on the right--
this is the protein

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.747
structure on the left, the
DNA structure on the right,

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:32.080
and in yellow are some of
these highly mutated residues.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.260
It turns out that all of the
frequently mutated residues

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.390
are ones that occur at
the protein DNA interface.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.950
All right, so in
a single picture,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.020
we now understand
what was an enigma

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.390
for years and years and years.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.760
Why are the mutations so
particularly clustered

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.532
in this protein in
non obvious ways?

00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:49.490
Since that is the interface
between the protein

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.950
and the DNA, these
mutations upset

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.700
the transcriptional regulation
through the action of p53.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.304
So if we want to understand
protein structure in order

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:01.845
to understand protein
function, where

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:03.860
are we going to get
these structures from?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.710
So the statistics on how
proteins themselves-- I

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.400
show here.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.510
This is from the-- I'll call it
the PDB, the Protein Database.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.130
Its full name is the
RCSB Protein Database,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.685
but it's usually
just called the PDB.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.810
And here, it shows that,
at the time of this slide,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.560
around 80,000
structures have been

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.460
determined by x-ray
crystallography.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.410
The next most frequent method
was NMR, Nuclear Magnetic

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.230
Resonance, which identified
about 10,000 structures,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.300
and all the other
techniques produce

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.690
very, very few
structures, hundreds

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.010
of structures rather
than thousands.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.400
So how do these techniques work?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400
Well, they don't magically
give you a structure.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.900
Right?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.483
They give you information that
you have to use computationally

00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:44.490
to derive the structure.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.880
Here's a schematic
of how structures

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.750
are solved by x-ray
crystallography.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.970
One has to actually grow
a crystal of the protein

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.872
or the protein and
other molecules

00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:54.330
that you're interested
in studying.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.190
These are not giant
crystals like quarts.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.950
They're even smaller
than table salt.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.950
They're usually barely
visible with the naked eye,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.095
and they're very unstable.

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:07.150
They have to be kept in
solution or, often, frozen,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.910
and you should a very
high powered x-ray

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.870
beam through them.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.204
Now, most of the x-rays are--
what are they going to do?

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:14.661
They're going to pass right
through because x-rays interact

00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:15.770
very weakly with matter.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.561
But a few of the x-rays
will be diffracted,

00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:19.390
and from that weak
diffraction pattern,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.350
you can actually deduce
where the electrons were

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.560
that scattered the x-rays
as they hit the crystal.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.800
And so this is a
picture, the lower right,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.620
of electron density cloud in
light blue with the protein

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.040
structures snaking
through it, and what

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.530
you can calculate,
after a lot of work,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.450
from these crystallographic
diffraction

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.441
patterns is the location
of the electron density.

00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.190
And then there's a
computational challenge

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.810
to try to figure out the
location of the atoms that

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.360
would have given rise
to that electron density

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.050
that then, when hit with
x-rays, would have given rise

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.900
to the x-ray
diffraction pattern.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.170
So it's actually an
iterative process

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.494
where one arrives at the initial
structure and then calculates,

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:05.410
from that structure,
where the electrons would

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.330
be, from the
position of electrons

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.920
where the diffraction pattern
would be when the x-rays hit

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.690
it, and determines how well
that predicted diffraction

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.140
pattern agrees with the
actual diffraction pattern,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.739
and then continuously iterates.

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.030
And so this is obviously a
highly computational problem

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.500
because you not
only have to find

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.540
positions that are maximally
consistent with the observed

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.020
diffraction pattern, but also
positions that are actually

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.620
consistent with physics.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.270
So if we have a piece
of a molecule here,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.190
we can't just put
our atoms anywhere.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.370
They need to be positioned
with well defined distances

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.300
for the bonds, the
bond angles, and so on.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.980
So it's a highly coupled
problem that we have to solve,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.897
and we'll look at some of
the techniques that underlie

00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:47.980
these approaches, although
we'll look specifically

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.470
at how to solve x-ray
crystal structures.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.450
I mentioned the second
most common technique

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.810
is nuclear magnetic
resonance, and this

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.860
is a technology that does
not require the crystals,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.180
but requires a very
high concentration

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.320
of soluble protein, which
presents its own problems.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.610
And the information
that you get out

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.500
of a nuclear magnetic
resonance structure

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.380
is not the electron
density locations,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.900
but it's actually
a set of distances

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.420
that tell you the relative
distance between two

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.510
atoms, usually protons,
in the structure,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.440
and that's what's represented
by these yellow lines here.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.830
And once again, we've got a
hard computational problem

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.910
where we need to figure out a
structure of the protein that's

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.540
consistent with all
the physical forces

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.910
and also puts particular
protons at particular distances

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.460
from each other.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.350
So we talk about solving
crystal structures,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.980
solving NMR
structures, because it

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.300
is the solution to a
very, very complicated

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.190
computational challenge.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.690
So these techniques
that we're going

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.300
to look at, while
not specifically

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.040
for the solution of
crystal and NMR structures,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.520
underlie those technologies.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.270
What we're going to
focus on is actually

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.980
perhaps an even more
complicated problem,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.080
the de novo discovery
of protein structures.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.210
So if I start off
with a sequence,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.590
can I actually
tell you something

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.800
important and accurate
about the structure?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.599
Now, there's a nice
summary in a book called

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.140
Structural Bioinformatics
that really

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.410
deals with a lot of the issues
around computational biology

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.360
is relates to structure,
that highlights many

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.350
of the differences between the
kinds of algorithms we've been

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.830
looking at up until now in
this course and the kinds

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.430
of approaches that
we need to take

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.550
in our understanding
of protein structure.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.020
So the first and
most fundamental

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.130
obvious thing is
that we're dealing

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.546
with three-dimensional
structures,

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:28.180
so we're moving away from the
simple linear representations

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.860
of the data and
dealing with more

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.770
complicated
three-dimensional problems.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.320
And therefore, we encounter
all sorts of new problems.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.950
We no longer a
discrete search space.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.525
We have a continuous
search space,

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:41.900
and we'll look at
algorithms that

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.290
try to reduce that continuous
search space back down

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.044
to a discrete one to make
it a simpler problem.

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:49.960
But perhaps most
fundamentally, the difference

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.410
is that now we have to bring
in a lot of physical knowledge

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.610
to underlie our algorithms.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.240
It's not enough to solve this
as a complete abstraction

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.790
from the physics,
but we actually

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.014
have to deal with the physics
in the heart of the algorithms.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:03.680
And we'll look at the
issues highlighted

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.590
in red in the rest of this talk.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.090
Another thing that's
going to emerge

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.959
is that it would
be nice if there

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:12.250
was a simple mapping of
protein sequence to structures,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.916
and if that were the
case, you'd imagine

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:16.457
that two proteins that are
very different in sequence

00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:17.790
would have different structures.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.970
But in fact, that's
not the case.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.410
You can have two proteins
that have almost no sequence

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.659
similarity at all but adopt
the same three-dimensional

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.486
structure, so clearly, it's an
extremely complicated problem

00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:28.860
made more complicated
by the fact

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.360
that we don't know
all the structures.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.401
It's not like we're
selecting from a discrete set

00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:35.090
of known structures to figure
out what our new molecule is.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.110
We have, in potential,
infinite number

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.187
of confirmations and protein
chains we need to deal with.

00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:43.770
OK, so I hope that you've had a
chance to look at the material

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.910
that I've posted online for
review of protein structure.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.320
If you haven't, please do so.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.480
It'll be very helpful
in understanding

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.160
the next few lectures,
and I'll assume

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.368
that you're familiar with
the basic elements, protein

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:55.110
structure, what
alpha helices are,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.880
what beta sheets are, primary
structure, secondary structure,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.750
and so on.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.190
And I'll also encourage
you to become familiar

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.899
with amino acids.

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.314
It's very hard to understand
anything in protein structure

00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:06.790
without having some knowledge
of what the amino acids are.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.600
The textbook has
a nice figure that

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.535
summarizes the many overlapping
ways to describe the features

00:10:12.535 --> 00:10:16.020
in amino acids, so please
familiarize yourself with that.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.550
So these are resources
that we posted online.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.130
Also, the Protein
Databank, the RCSB,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.540
has fantastic resources
online for beginning

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.820
to understand protein
structure, so I

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.689
encourage you to look
at their website.

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:29.230
In particular, in
their website, they

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.444
have tools that you can
download to visualize protein

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.860
structures, and
that's going to be

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.349
a critical component of
understanding these algorithms,

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.640
to actually understand what
these structures look like.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.598
I've highlighted, too,
that I find particularly

00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:42.400
easy to use PyMOL
and Swiss PDB Viewer.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.954
You can not only
look at structures

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:46.120
with these techniques, you
can actually modify them.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.560
You can do homology modeling.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.950
So before we get into algorithms
for understanding protein

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.590
structure, we need
to understand how

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.350
protein structures
are represented.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.652
I've already mentioned that
there are these repeating units

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:01.860
that I'd like you already
know about-- alpha helices,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.420
beta sheets.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.550
We won't go into
those in any detail.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.461
But the two more
quantitative ways

00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:07.960
of describing protein
structure have

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.751
to do with a
three-dimensional coordinates,

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.290
the XYZ coordinates
of every atom,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.890
and internal
coordinates, and we'll

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.820
go through those a
little bit of detail.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.150
So again, this PDB
website has a lot

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.800
of great resources
for understanding

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.760
what these
coordinates look like.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.260
They have a good description
of what's called a PDB file,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.000
and those PDB files look
like this at the outset.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.360
They have what is now called
metadata, but at the time

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.320
was just information about
how the protein structure was

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.080
solved.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.630
So it'll tell you what organism
the protein comes from,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.630
where it was actually
synthesized if it wasn't

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.260
purified from that organism, but
if it was made recombinantly,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.250
details like that, details about
how the crystal structure was

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.160
determined.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.810
The sequence-- most of
this won't concern us,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.880
but what will concern us is
this bottom section shown here

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.380
in more detail.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.240
So let's just look at what
each of these lines represents.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.410
The lines that contain
information about the atomic

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.850
coordinates all begin
with the word ATOM,

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.950
and then there's a
index number that

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.620
just is referenced for
each line of the file,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.050
tells you what kind of atom it
is, what chain in the protein

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.660
it is, and the residue number.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.540
So here, it's starting
with residue 100.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.110
The sequence here
can be arbitrary

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.210
and may not relate to the
sequence of the protein

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.372
as it appears in
SWISS-PROT or Gen Bank.

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:26.830
And then the next
three columns are

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.455
the ones that are
most important to us,

00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:31.050
so these are the XYZ
coordinates of the atom.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.012
So to identify the
position of any molecule

00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:34.720
in three-dimensional
space, obviously you

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.340
need three coordinates,
and so those

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.140
are what those three
coordinates are.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.390
And they're followed by these
two other numbers, which

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.080
actually are very interesting
numbers because they tell us

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.260
something about how certain
we are that the molecule is

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.890
really-- the atom is really at
that position in the crystal

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.040
structure.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.710
So the first of these
is the occupancy.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.312
In a crystal structure,
we're actually

00:12:55.312 --> 00:12:57.520
getting the information
about thousands and thousands

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.734
of molecules that are in the
repeating units of the crystal,

00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:02.150
and it's possible
that there could

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.720
be some variation in the
structure between one

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.620
unit of the crystal
and the next.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.030
So you could have a side
chain that, in one crystal,

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.230
is over here and in
the next crystal--

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.880
a repeating unit of the
crystals over there.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.110
If there are discrete
confirmations,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.830
then you imagine that the
signal will be reduced,

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.580
and you'll actually
get some superposition

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.920
of all the possible
confirmations.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.870
So number one here
means that there

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.877
seems to be one
predominate confirmation.

00:13:27.877 --> 00:13:30.460
But if there is more than one,
and their discrete-- if they're

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.084
continuous, it'll
just look like noise.

00:13:32.084 --> 00:13:34.080
It'll be hard to
determine the coordinates.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.580
But if they're
discrete positions,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.700
then you might find, for
example, an occupancy of 0.5

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.050
and then another line
with the other position

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.270
with an occupancy of 0.5.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.950
So that's when there's
discrete locations where

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.200
these atoms are located.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.410
The B factor's called
the thermal factor,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.030
and it tells you how
much thermal motion there

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.089
was in the crystal
at that position.

00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:57.130
Now, what does that mean?

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.380
If we think about a
crystal structure,

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.580
there'll be some parts of
it that are rock solid.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.660
In the center, it's
highly constrained.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.860
The dense core of the
protein, not too much

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.110
is going to be changing.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.730
But on the surface
of the protein,

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.770
there can be residues
that are highly flexible.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.070
And so as those are being
knocked around in the crystal,

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.800
they are scattering the x-rays
in slightly different ways.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.880
But they're not in
discrete confirmations,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.180
so we're not going to see
multiple independent positions.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.227
We'll just see some
average positions.

00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:27.560
And that kind of noise can
be accounted for with these B

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.510
factors, where high numbers
represent highly mobile parts

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.120
of the structure,
and low numbers

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.035
represent very stable ones.

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.820
A very low number here
would be, say, a 20.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.890
These numbers of 80--
typically, things like that

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.390
occur at the ends
of molecules where

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.180
there is a lot of
structural flexibility.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.920
So we have this one
way of describing

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.010
the structure of a protein where
we specify the XYZ coordinates

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.620
of every one of these atoms,
and we'd have these other two

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.200
parameters to represent thermal
motion and static disorder.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.380
Now, are those coordinates
uniquely defined?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.780
If I have this
structure, is there

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.360
exactly one way to write
down the XYZ coordinates?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.000
Hands?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.900
How many people say yes?

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.650
How many people say no?

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.984
Why not?

00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:14.370
AUDIENCE: You can rotate it.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.578
PROFESSOR: You can rotate it.

00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:16.370
You set the origin.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.894
Right?

00:15:16.894 --> 00:15:18.560
So there's no unique
way of defining it,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.390
and that'll come up again later.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.372
OK, now, this is
a very precise way

00:15:22.372 --> 00:15:24.330
of describing the
three-dimensional coordinates

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.120
in protein, but it's not a very
concise way of representing it.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.490
Now, why is that?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.476
Well, as the static
model represents,

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.350
there are certain parts
of protein structures

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.080
that are really not going
to change very much.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.940
The lengths of the
bonds change very little

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.770
in protein structures.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.510
The angles, the tetrahedrally
coordinated carbon,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.520
doesn't suddenly
become flat, planar.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.550
These things happen very-- there
may be very small deformations.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.960
So if I had to specify the XYZ
coordinates of this carbon,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.460
I really don't have
too many degrees

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.820
of freedom for where
the other carbon can be.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.380
It has to lie in a sphere
at a certain distance.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.860
So instead of representing
XYZ coordinates of every atom,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.020
I can use internal coordinates.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.590
So here in this slide,
we have amino acids--

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.830
the amino nitrogen,
the carbonyl carbon.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.580
So this is a single amino acid.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.020
Here's the peptide bond
that goes to the next one.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.050
And as this diagram
indicates, the bond

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.922
between the carbonyl
carbon of one amino acid

00:16:20.922 --> 00:16:22.505
and the amide nitrogen
of the next one

00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:25.597
is planar, so that angle
isn't even rotating.

00:16:25.597 --> 00:16:28.180
So that's one degree of freedom
that we've completely removed.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.986
The angles that rotate in the
backbone or called phi and psi;

00:16:31.986 --> 00:16:37.410
phi over here,
and psi over here.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.160
So those are two
degrees of freedom

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.930
that determine how
this amino acid is--

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.560
the confirmation
of this amino acid.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.640
So instead of specifying
all the coordinates,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.630
I can specify the
backbone simply

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.280
by giving two numbers to every
amino acid, the phi and psi

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.220
angles, with the
assumption that the omega

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.560
angle, this peptide
backbone, remains constant.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.057
And similarly for
the side chains,

00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:01.890
and we'll go into this
in more detail later,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.859
we can then give the
coordinates, the rotation,

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.930
of rotatable bonds
in the side chain

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.155
and not specify every
atom as we go out.

00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:11.530
OK, so we've got these two
different ways of representing

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.569
protein structure, and we'll
see that they're both used.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.829
Any questions on this?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.540
Great.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.774
OK, so if we're looking
at protein structures,

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:23.440
one question we want
to ask is how do we

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.339
compare two protein
structures to each other?

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.070
So I already mentioned
that proteins

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.410
can have similar
structure, whether or not

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.950
they are highly
similar in sequence.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.380
So if I have two proteins that
are highly homologous, that

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.350
do have a high level of sequence
similarity-- for example,

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.050
these two orthologs,
this one from cow

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.195
and this one from rat--
you can see, at a distance,

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:43.820
they both have very
similar structures.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.480
They also have 74%
sequence similarity,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.970
so that's not surprising.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.400
But you can get proteins
that have very low sequence

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.570
similarity.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.660
They're still
evolutionary related,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.330
like these orthologs, two
different species that

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.630
have the same protein, or
paralogs, a single species that

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.890
have two similar copies,
but non identical copies,

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.410
in the same protein that
maintain the same structure

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.410
when they only have about 20%
to 30% sequence similarity.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.440
And you can get even more
distant relationships.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.500
So here are two
proteins, both in

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.580
human, evolutionarily related,
but only 4% sequence identity.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.077
And yet at a distance,
they look almost identical.

00:18:24.077 --> 00:18:25.910
And those are evolutionary
related proteins,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.880
but we can also have things
that are called analogs, which

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.570
have no evolutionary
relationship,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.020
no obvious sequence
similarity, and yet adopt

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.410
almost identical
protein structures.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.950
So this adds to the complexity
of the biological problems

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.605
that we're going
to try to solve.

00:18:38.605 --> 00:18:40.320
All right, so how
do I quantitatively

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.510
compare two protein structures?

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.180
So the common
measurement is something

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.760
called RMSD, Root
Mean Square Deviation,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.260
and here, I have a
set of structures

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.542
that were solved by NMR.

00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:53.000
And you can see that there's
a core of the structure that's

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.510
well determined
and then there are

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.635
pieces of the structure
that are poorly determined.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.862
There weren't enough
constraints to define them.

00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:00.570
And these proteins
have all been aligned,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.510
so the XYZ coordinates have
been rotated and translated

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.625
to give maximal agreement.

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.000
And what's the
agreement measure?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.541
It's this Root Mean
Square Deviation.

00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:12.230
So I need to define pairs of
atoms in my two structures.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.970
If it's, in this case, the same
structure, that's really easy.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.780
Every atom has a match
in this structure that

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.107
was solved with
the same molecule.

00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:23.190
But if we're dealing with
two homologous proteins,

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.981
then that becomes a
little bit more tricky.

00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:27.480
We need to define which amino
acids are going to match up.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.447
We can also define whether we
care about changes in the side

00:19:30.447 --> 00:19:33.030
chains, or whether we only care
about changes in the backbone,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.030
whether we're going
to worry about

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.064
whether the protons in
the right places or not.

00:19:36.064 --> 00:19:37.730
And you'll see that
these alignments can

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.710
be done with either only
heavy chain, heavy atoms,

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.940
meaning excluding the hydrogens,
or only main chain atoms,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.600
meaning excluding the
side chains completely.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.359
But once we've defined the
pairs of corresponding atoms,

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:53.650
then we're going to take the
difference in the distance

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.729
squared, sum of the
squares of the distances

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:58.020
between the corresponding
atoms and their x-coordinate,

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.680
their y-coordinate, and
they're z-coordinate.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.055
Take the square
root of that sum,

00:20:01.055 --> 00:20:03.917
and that's going to give us
the Root Mean Square Deviation.

00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:06.250
And of course, we have to
minimize that Root Mean Square

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.200
Deviation with these
rigid body rotations

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.310
to account for the fact
that I could have my PDB

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.305
file with the
origin of this atom.

00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:14.680
Or I could have my PDB file
with the origin of that atom,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.940
and so on.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.150
OK.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.770
Any questions so far?

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.450
Yes.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.079
AUDIENCE: Do we consider every
single atom in the molecule?

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.370
PROFESSOR: So we have a choice.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.530
The question was do we
consider every single atom

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.197
in the molecule?

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:31.029
We don't have to do,
and it depends, really,

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.810
on the problem that
we're trying to solve.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.760
So if we're looking for
whether two proteins have

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.130
the same fold, we might not
care about the side chains.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.770
We might restrict ourselves
to main chain atoms.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.170
But if we're trying to
decide whether two crystal

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.410
structures are in good
agreement with each other,

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.554
or say, as we'll
see a few minutes,

00:20:47.554 --> 00:20:49.720
we're going to try to predict
the structure protein,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.870
and we have the experimentally
determined structure

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.619
of the same protein,
and we want to decide

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.203
whether those two
agree, in that case,

00:20:55.203 --> 00:20:56.660
we might actually
want to make sure

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.760
that every single atom
is in the right position.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.600
So it'll depend on the question
that we're trying to answer.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.360
Good question.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.193
Any other questions?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.197
OK.

00:21:08.197 --> 00:21:09.780
All right, so so
far, I've shown a lot

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.690
of static pictures of molecules.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.185
I do want to stress
that molecules actually

00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:16.560
move around a lot, so I'll
just show a little movie here.

00:21:19.548 --> 00:21:23.034
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:18.954
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:20.870
PROFESSOR: OK, so that
was, in part, an excuse

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.390
to play a little New
Age music in class,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.570
but more fundamentally,
it was to remind you

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.050
that, despite the
fact that we're

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.350
going to show you a lot of
static pictures of proteins,

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.250
they're actually
extremely dynamic.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.170
And they have well
defined structures,

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.590
but they may have more than
one well defined structure,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.849
especially those molecules
that are doing work.

00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:42.390
They're actually
moving things along.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.640
They have multiple structures.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.670
And so when we consider
the protein structure,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.730
it's an approximation,
and we're always

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:52.150
going to mean the protein
structures, not singular one.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.010
OK, so what determines
the protein structure?

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.640
Well, I've told
you it's physics.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.620
Fundamentally, it's
a physical problem,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.170
so the optimal protein structure
has to be an energetic minimum.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.450
There has to be no net
force acting on the protein.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.180
The force is negative derivative
of the potential energy,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.120
so that derivative has to be 0.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.307
So we have to have a minimum
of protein structure.

00:24:13.307 --> 00:24:15.640
Now, that doesn't mean that
there's exactly one minimum.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.140
Those proteins that had multiple
confirmations in that movie

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.980
obviously had multiple minima
that they could adopt depending

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.630
on other circumstances,
but there

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.540
has to be at least
a local minimum.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.055
So if we knew this U, this
potential energy function,

00:24:30.055 --> 00:24:31.680
and we could take
the derivative of it,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.830
we could identify the protein
structure or the protein

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.020
structures by simply
identifying the minima

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.770
in that potential
energy function.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.280
Now, would that life
were so simple, right?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.385
But we will see that there are
ways of parameterizing the U

00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:48.340
and using it to optimize
the structure so it finds

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.790
this, at least local, minimum.

00:24:52.345 --> 00:24:53.720
And we're going
to look primarily

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.920
at two different ways of
describing the potential energy

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.610
function.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.890
One of them, we're going to look
at the problem like a physicist

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.348
one, and the other
way, we're going

00:25:01.348 --> 00:25:03.500
to look at it as a
statistician would.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.080
So the physicist wants to
describe, as you might imagine,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.200
the physical forces that
underlie the protein structure,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.580
and so as much as
possible, we're

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.080
going to try to
write down equations

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.665
that represent those forces.

00:25:14.665 --> 00:25:16.040
Now, we're not
always going to be

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.380
able to do that because
a lot of forces involved

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.790
are quantum mechanical.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.360
The mere fact the
two solid objects

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.260
don't pass through each other is
because of exclusion principles

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.644
that deal with
quantum mechanics.

00:25:26.644 --> 00:25:29.060
We're not going to write down
quantum mechanical equations

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.726
for every atom in our
protein structure,

00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:33.134
but we will write down equations
that approximate those.

00:25:33.134 --> 00:25:34.550
And wherever
possible, we're going

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.100
to try to tie the
terms in our equations

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.320
into something
identifiable in physics,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.190
and a very good example of this
approach is the CHARMM program.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.350
And these approaches
actually were the ones

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.450
that won the Nobel Prize in
chemistry this past year.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.540
At the other end of the spectrum
are the statistical approaches.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.831
Here, we don't really care
what the underlying physical

00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:54.470
properties are.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.600
We want equations that
capture what we see in nature.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.860
Now, often, these two
approaches will align very well.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.860
There'll be some approximations
that the physicist makes

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.422
to capture a fundamental
physical force.

00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:07.880
That's simply the best way to
describe what you see nature,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.160
and so those two terms may look
indistinguishable in the CHARMM

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.150
version or my favorite
statistical approach, which

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.360
is Rosetta.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.330
So we'll see that some
terms in these functions

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.749
agree between
CHARMM and Rosetta.

00:26:18.749 --> 00:26:20.790
Well, there'll be places
where they fundamentally

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.040
disagree on how to describe
the molecular potential energy

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.180
function because one is trying
to describe the physical forces

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.230
and the other one is trying to
describe the statistical ones.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.750
Do we have any native speakers
of German in the audience?

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.020
AUDIENCE: I'm a speaker.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.914
PROFESSOR: You want to
read the joke for us?

00:26:35.914 --> 00:26:36.538
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:36.538 --> 00:26:39.810
Institute for Quantum
Physics, and it says

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.767
"You can find yourself
here or here."

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:42.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.610
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.150
PROFESSOR: All right,
so for the video,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.710
it's the Institute
for Quantum Mechanics.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.315
And you go to a map at MIT,
and it'll say, you find,

00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:51.940
"You are here."

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.410
Right?

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.535
But in the Institute for
Quantum Mechanics, it says

00:26:54.535 --> 00:26:56.216
"You're either here or here."

00:26:56.216 --> 00:26:57.590
So that's the
physicist approach.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.080
We really do have to think
about those quantum mechanical

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.470
features, whereas on
the right-hand side

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.850
is the statisticians approach.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.130
It says "Data don't
make any sense.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.140
We'll have to resort
to statistics."

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:08.950
OK?

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.190
So the statistician
can get pretty far

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.936
without understanding the
underlying physical forces.

00:27:13.936 --> 00:27:16.060
All right, so let's look
at this physicist approach

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.393
first, so we're going to break
down the potential energy

00:27:18.393 --> 00:27:21.722
function into bonded terms
and non-bonded terms.

00:27:21.722 --> 00:27:23.180
So the bonded terms,
as they sound,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.990
are going to be atoms that
are close to each other

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.370
in the bonded structures, so
certainly these two atoms,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.690
because they're connected
by a single bond,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.000
are going to be bonded terms.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.170
But we'll see groups of three
or four atoms near each other

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.359
will also be bonded terms.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:36.900
And the non-bonded
terms will be when

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.690
I have another molecule that
comes close, but isn't directly

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.330
connected.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.160
What are the physical
forces between these two ?

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.560
So these bonded terms
then first break down

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.754
into a lot of sub terms.

00:27:47.754 --> 00:27:49.420
I'll show you the
functional forms here.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.070
We'll just look at a
few of them in detail

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.278
and then give you a sense
of what the other ones are.

00:27:53.278 --> 00:27:55.100
So this first one
is the bonded term

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.060
that describes, actually, the
distance between two bonded

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.150
atoms.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.800
Now, again, this
is fundamentally

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.020
quantum mechanical
property, but it

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.646
would be too
computationally expensive

00:28:04.646 --> 00:28:06.020
to describe the
quantum mechanics

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.630
and not really necessary because
you can do pretty well by just

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.720
describing this
as a stiff spring.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.360
So that's what this quadratic
form of the equation

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.380
represents.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.670
So we simply define
b naught here

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.710
as the equilibrium
position between these two

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:23.950
atoms, particular types.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.546
There would be two tetrahedral
coordinated carbons,

00:28:26.546 --> 00:28:28.170
and that would be
determined by looking

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.753
at a lot of very,
very high resolution

00:28:29.753 --> 00:28:31.350
structures in small
molecule crystals

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.760
so we know what the typical
distance for this bond is.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.302
We get that as a parameter.

00:28:36.302 --> 00:28:38.260
There would be a big file
in the CHARMM program

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.801
that lists all those parameters
for every one of these bonded

00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:44.290
terms, and then if there's
a small deviation from that,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.090
because the molecules
stretched a bit

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.540
in your refinement
process, there

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.190
would be a penalty to
pull it back in just

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.630
like a spring pulls it back in.

00:28:56.314 --> 00:28:58.230
Now, it turns out that
when you go this route,

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.396
you have to actually come
up with a lot of equations

00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:03.000
to maintain the geometry
because, again, we're

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.584
going to have to not only worry
about these distance bonds,

00:29:05.584 --> 00:29:07.000
but we need to
worry about angles.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.810
So we've got the angle between
this bond and this bond.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.070
What keeps that in place?

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.610
So we need to add another
term that's a second term here

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.024
to make the angle
between these fixed,

00:29:17.024 --> 00:29:18.440
and then we have
to deal with what

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.650
are called dihedral angles
to make sure that these four

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.015
atoms lie in the
allowed geometry.

00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:27.640
And so each one of
these terms accounts

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.850
for something like that.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.770
This last term over
here makes sure

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.090
that the phi and psi angles
are consistent with what

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.725
we see in quantum mechanics as
corrected for any deviations

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:39.040
that we see in these
small molecules

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.100
so a lot of terms with a lot
of parameters they're trying

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.492
to capture the best description
of what we observe in each one

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:46.950
is motivated by
the fact that there

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.650
is some quantum mechanical
principle underlying it.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.339
So-- yes?

00:29:50.339 --> 00:29:51.714
AUDIENCE: Why is
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:58.407
PROFESSOR: I actually don't
know the answer to that.

00:29:58.407 --> 00:29:59.990
But there's a reference
there that I'm

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.239
sure will give you the answer.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.894
OK, now what about
these non-bonded terms?

00:30:06.894 --> 00:30:08.310
So non-bonded terms
of the set are

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.760
molecules that are distant from
each other in the structure

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.470
of the protein, but
close to each other

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.720
in three-dimensional space.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.300
And there are two
fundamental forces here.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.890
The first one is called the
Leonard Jones potential,

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.020
and the second one of
the electrostatic one.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.320
And the Leonard Jones potential
itself has these two terms.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.390
One is an R6 term, a negative
r to the 6th dependency.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.780
The other one is
positive nr to the 12th.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.260
The negative r to the 6th
is an attractive potential.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.840
That's why it's
negative, and it's

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.400
because of small
induced dipoles that

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.950
occur in the electron clouds
of each of these atoms that

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.560
pull the molecules together.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.370
And the 1 over r to
the 6th dependency

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.120
has to do with the physics
of two dipoles interacting.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.280
The r over 12 term
is an approximation

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.540
to a quantum mechanical force.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.520
So the reason the two molecules
don't pass through each other,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.690
as we said already, is because
quantum mechanical forces.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.440
That would be very
expensive to compute,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.540
so we come up with a term
that's easy to compute.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.430
And of course, an
r 12 term is simply

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.330
the square of an
r to the 6th term,

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.957
so if you already computed 1
over r to the 6th between two

00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:14.540
atoms, you just square that, and
you get 1 over r to the 12th.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.165
So it's very
computationally efficient,

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:19.920
and you adjust the
parameters, these r mins,

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.150
so that it works out so that
these things agree reasonably

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.750
well with the
crystal structures.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.875
And these are crystal
structures of small molecules

00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:28.502
that we know in great detail.

00:31:28.502 --> 00:31:29.960
And then the
electrostatics is what

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.510
you might expect
for electrostatics.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.110
It's got a potential that
varies as 1 over the distance,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.930
and as the product
of those charges,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.980
these can be full charges or
they can be partial charges.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.892
And there's a term
here, this epsilon,

00:31:42.892 --> 00:31:45.100
which is the dielectric
constant, and that represents

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.890
the fact that, in vacuum,
there'd be much greater

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.440
force pulling two
oppositely charged molecules

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.790
together than in water because
the water's going to shield.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.970
And so these
electrostatic terms,

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:01.730
this dihedral dielectric
potential term,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.990
can vary from one, which is
vacuum, to, say, 80 for water.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.640
And setting that
is a bit of an art.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.810
OK, so what do these
potentials look like?

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.800
Those are shown here.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.370
This is the, in dark lines,
the sum of the van der Waals

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.580
potential.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.850
It consists of that
attractive term,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.910
which has the r
over 6 dependency,

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.660
and the repulsive term
with the r over 12.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.964
And why does it go up so
high at short distances?

00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:27.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.628
PROFESSOR: Right,
because you can't

00:32:28.628 --> 00:32:30.574
have molecules that overlap.

00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:31.990
You'll see that
there's a minimum,

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.930
so there's an optimal
distance barring

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.890
any other forces
between two atoms.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.130
So that's roughly what
these hard sphere distances

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.880
represent in the scale models.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.380
And then the
electrostatic potential

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.700
also, obviously,
has attractive term,

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.830
but it's going to
blow up as you get

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.340
to small values,
increasingly favorable.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.910
And so the net sum of
those two is shown here,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.510
the combination of van der
Waals and electrostatics.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.354
It, again, has a strong
minimum but becomes

00:33:03.354 --> 00:33:05.270
highly positive as you
get to close distances.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.110
OK, any questions
on these forces?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.610
Yes?

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.930
AUDIENCE: Do the van der
Waals equal the Leonard Jones

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.430
potential?

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.513
Or is that something else?

00:33:16.513 --> 00:33:18.874
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
typically, those two terms

00:33:18.874 --> 00:33:19.915
are used interchangeably.

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.224
Yeah.

00:33:21.224 --> 00:33:21.890
Other questions?

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.620
OK.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.450
All right, so that's
how the physicist

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.300
would describe the
potential energy function.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.850
Rosetta, as I told
you, is an example

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.250
of the statistical approach.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.870
It rejects all this
sharp definition

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.870
of trying to compute exactly
the right distance between two

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.510
atoms by having a stiff
spring between them

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.727
and says let's just fix
a lot of these angles.

00:33:44.727 --> 00:33:46.935
So we're going to fix the
distance between two atoms.

00:33:46.935 --> 00:33:48.540
There's no point
in having them vary

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.890
by tiny, tiny fractions
in the bond length.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.906
We're going to fix a
tetrahedral coordination

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.030
of our tetrahedral carbons.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.780
We're not going to let them
deform because that never

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.470
would happen in
reality, and so we're

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.350
going to focus our
search over the space

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.240
entirely over the
rotatable bonds.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.220
So remember, how
many rotatable bonds

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.900
did we have in the backbone?

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.650
We had two, right?

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.080
We had the phi and
the psi angles,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.790
and then the side
chains then will

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.659
have rotatable bonds
over the side chains.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.030
So in this example,
this is a cysteine.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.580
Here's the backbone.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.670
Here's the sulfur.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.991
And we have exactly one
rotatable bond of interest

00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:23.449
because we don't really care
where the hydrogen is located.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.854
So we've got this chi 1 angle.

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:26.270
If there were more
atoms out here,

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.040
this would be called
chi 2 and chi 3.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.719
And these can rotate, but
they don't rotate freely.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.440
We don't observe, in
crystal structures,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.790
every possible rotation
of these angles,

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.770
and that's what this plot
on the left represents.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.929
For this side chain, there's
a chi 1, a chi 2, and a chi 3,

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.792
and the dark regions represent
the observed confirmations

00:34:47.792 --> 00:34:49.250
over many, many
crystal structures.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.210
And you can see it's
highly non uniform.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.172
Now why is that?

00:34:53.172 --> 00:34:54.741
I see people with
their hands trying

00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:55.949
to figure it out in the back.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.910
So why is that?

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.210
Figure that's what
you guys are doing.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.370
If not, it's very
interesting sign language.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.390
So if we look down one of
these tetrahedral carbon-carbon

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.340
bonds, we have apparently
a free rotation.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.099
But in fact, some
these confirmations,

00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:12.890
we're going to have a
lot of steric clashes

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.940
between the atoms on one carbon
and the atoms on the other,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.510
and so this is not a
favorable confirmation.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.629
The favorable
confirmation is offset,

00:35:20.629 --> 00:35:23.170
and that propagates throughout
all the chains in the protein.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.503
So there'll be certain angles
that are highly preferred,

00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:26.920
and other ones that are not.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.417
These highly preferred
angles are called rotamers,

00:35:29.417 --> 00:35:30.750
and so we'll use the term a lot.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.200
It stands for
rotational isomers.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.235
And so now, we've turned
our continuous problem

00:35:35.235 --> 00:35:38.070
of figuring out what the
optimal angle is for this chi 1

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.370
rotation into a discrete
problem where maybe there

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:45.000
are only two or three possible
options for that rotation.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.760
And so now, we
can decide is this

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.550
better than this
one or this one?

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.750
Questions on rotamers
or any of this?

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.690
Excellent.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.092
OK, so how do we determine--
we've decided then

00:36:00.092 --> 00:36:01.550
we're going to
describe the protein

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.770
entirely by these
internal coordinates--

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.550
the phi, the psi, the backbone,
the chi angles of the side

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.480
chain.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.170
We still need a potential
energy function, right?

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.600
That hasn't told us how to
find the optimal settings,

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.880
and we're going to try to
avoid the approach of CHARMM,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.740
where we actually look
at quantum mechanics

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.387
to decide what
all the terms are.

00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:22.220
So how do they actually
go about doing this?

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.150
Well, they take a number of high
resolution crystal structures,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.910
and they characterize
certain properties

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.076
in those crystal structures.

00:36:29.076 --> 00:36:30.960
For example, they
might characterize

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.960
how often a certain
aliphatic carbon-- how often

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.569
aliphatic carbons are
near amide nitrogens,

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:38.110
and they might
measure the distance--

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.940
they do measure the distance
between these amide nitrogens

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.790
and aliphatic carbons across
all the crystal structures

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.290
and determine how often
those distances occur.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.700
And you can actually turn
those observations, then,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.890
into a potential energy
function by simply

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.980
using Boltzmann's equation.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.380
So we can figure
out how frequently

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.537
we get certain
distances on the x-axis

00:36:58.537 --> 00:37:01.860
is distance, on the y-axis is
frequency, number of entries

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.770
in the crystal structure,
and then by Boltzmann's Law,

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.152
we can compute the
density of states

00:37:11.152 --> 00:37:13.610
over some reference, which is
actually very hard to define.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.850
And you can look at some
of the references referred

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.350
to in the slides to figure out
how currently that's defined,

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.010
but we have to find some
arbitrary reference state

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.270
to figure out the probability
of being any one of these states

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.880
is going to be a function,
a logarithmic function,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.837
of the frequency
of those states.

00:37:29.837 --> 00:37:32.170
All right, so we've got an
energy term that's determined

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.200
solely by the
observations of distances,

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.670
that doesn't say I know that
this one's charge and this one

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.169
isn't.

00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:40.730
It just says here's
an oxygen attached

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.230
to a carbon with double bonds.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.484
Here's a carbon that's not.

00:37:44.484 --> 00:37:46.400
How often are they at
any particular distance?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.610
And we go through lots and
lots of other properties,

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.630
and we'll go into detail now
to what those other terms are

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.630
to look through high
resolution crystal structures,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.191
see what certain
properties are, turn those

00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:59.190
into potential energy
functions that we can then

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.750
use to identify the optimum
rotations for the side

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.558
chain and the backbone.

00:38:05.558 --> 00:38:08.100
Oh, and I should also point
out that when we do this,

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.600
we'll have different terms
for different things.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.730
We'll have a term for distances
between different kinds

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.290
of atoms.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.659
We'll have terms for some
of these other pieces

00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:19.200
of potential energy that we'll
describe in subsequent slides,

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.575
and we're going
to need to decide

00:38:20.575 --> 00:38:23.350
how to weight all of those,
all those independent terms,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.126
to get them to give
us reasonable protein

00:38:25.126 --> 00:38:26.250
structures when we're done.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.830
And that, once again, is
a curve fitting exercise,

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.400
finding the numbers
that best fit the data

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.640
without any guiding physical
principle underneath it.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.060
So you'll be using PyRosetta.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.830
And in PyRosetta,
you'll see the terms

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.430
on the board for
the potential energy

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.920
functions, the
different features

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.330
of the potential
energy function,

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.996
and I'll step you
through a few of these

00:38:45.996 --> 00:38:48.850
just so you know
what you're using.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.670
There'll also be files
in PyRosetta installation

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.830
that will give you the
relative weights for each

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.310
of these terms.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.750
OK, so these first
are the van der Waals,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.460
and here, the shape of the curve
looks just like we saw before.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.560
It has to, in some
sense because they're

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.490
trying to solve the
same physical problem,

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.570
but the motivation
is very different.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.820
There's no attempt to
decide that it should be a 1

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.230
over r to the 6th because of
dipole-dipole interactions.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.050
And simply, how do I find
the function that accurately

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.440
represents what I
see in the database?

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.510
So again, computed, this is
the fa attractive and the fa

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.800
repulsive, and
those are determined

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.300
based on the
statistics of what's

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.930
observed in the
crystal structures.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:35.590
This one, the hbond, breaks down
into backbone and side chain,

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.240
long range and short range.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.810
And the goal of the
hbonds-- so hydrogen bonds

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.810
are one of the principal
determinants of protein

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.430
structure, and you'll see
that in the reading materials

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:46.590
that are posted online.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.756
And one of the critical
things about a hydrogen bond

00:39:48.756 --> 00:39:50.730
is that it needs to
be nearly planar.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:59.164
So the line between-- the
angle between this atom,

00:39:59.164 --> 00:40:01.330
which has the hydrogen
attached, and this one, which

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.170
is the free electron
pair, has to be

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.710
as close to linear as possible.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.300
And the more it
deviates from linear,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.250
the weaker the
hydrogen bond will be.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.970
And so this hydrogen
bonding potential

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.040
has terms that describe the
distance between the atoms that

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.400
are donating and
accepting the hydrogen

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.420
as well as the
angle between them,

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.870
and it's been parameterized
to represent, separately,

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.540
things that are far from each
other, close to each other,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.470
things that are side
chain, or main chain.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.730
And here's where it's
really the statistician

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.460
against the physicist.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.630
Why divide up side
chain and main chain?

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:37.500
There's no physical principle
that drives you to do that.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.440
It's simply because that's what
gives the best fit to the data,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.540
so the statistician is not
afraid to add terms that

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.010
make their models
better fit reality,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:50.800
even if they don't represent any
fundamental physical principle.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.255
And we'll see it gets
even more dramatic

00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:55.190
with some these other terms.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.667
So this is the
Ramachandran plot,

00:40:57.667 --> 00:40:59.250
which you'll also
see in your reading.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.230
It represents the
observed frequencies

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.490
of phi and the psi angles.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.960
And as you know that there
are only a couple positions

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.839
on this phi and psi plot
that are frequently observed,

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:11.130
representing the different
regular secondary structures

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.600
primarily, alpha helix and
beta sheet is indicated.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.400
And rather than trying to
capture the fact that protein

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.950
should form alpha
helices by having

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.890
really good forces all
around, they simply

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.217
prefer angles that are observed
in the Ramachandran plot.

00:41:25.217 --> 00:41:27.300
So we're going to give a
potential energy function

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.340
that's going to penalize you
if your phi and psi ends up

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.220
over here, and reward you
if your phi and psi ends up

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.820
in one of these positions.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.250
So from the physicist,
this is cheating,

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.250
and for the statistician,
it makes perfect sense.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.906
Shouldn't laugh at that.

00:41:43.906 --> 00:41:46.030
OK, and this same will be
true for the row numbers.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.571
So we said that,
for the side chains,

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.920
there are certain angles
that we prefer over others

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.410
because that's what we
observe in the database.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.118
Again, we're not going
to try to get them

00:41:53.118 --> 00:41:55.500
by making sure that there's
repulsion between these two

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.910
atoms when they're eclipsed.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.910
We're going to get
there simply by saying

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.050
the potential energy
is lower when you're

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.830
in one of these
staggered confirmations

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.705
than you're one of the
eclipse confirmations.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.640
OK, now, the place
where the difference

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.670
between the statistician and
the physicist is most dramatic

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:16.690
comes when we look at
the salvation terms.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.909
So a lot of what goes on
in protein structure--

00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:20.700
determines protein
structure, I should say,

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.930
is the interaction of
the protein with water.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.850
It's bathed in a bath of
55 molar water molecules,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:28.516
highly polar.

00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:30.640
They normally are hydrogen
bonding with each other.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.600
When the protein sits
in there, the protein

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.620
has to start hydrogen
bonding with them.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.680
And where do we find
hydrophobic residues

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.430
in a protein structure,
with your hands?

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.750
Outside or inside?

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.582
Inside, right?

00:42:41.582 --> 00:42:44.040
So the hydrophobic residue's
all going to be buried inside.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.662
Why is that?

00:42:45.662 --> 00:42:47.330
Well, it's actually
really, really hard

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.163
to describe in terms
of fundamental physical

00:42:49.163 --> 00:42:50.270
principles.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.940
In fact, it's really hard to
describe the structure of water

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.540
by fundamental
physical principles.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.340
Simulations that try
to get water to freeze

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.270
were only successful
a few years ago.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.300
So we've tried to
simulate water using

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.390
basic physical principles.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:03.566
It's very hard to
get it to form ice

00:43:03.566 --> 00:43:05.190
when you lower the
temperature, so it's

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.981
going to be even harder,
then, to represent

00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:10.370
how a complicated protein
structure immersed in the water

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:14.750
actually interacts with
those water molecules.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.200
So you've got all these
water molecules interacting

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.300
with polar residues
or non-polar residues.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.936
The physicist really
struggles to represent those.

00:43:21.936 --> 00:43:23.310
And just to show
you why that is,

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.570
let me show you,
again, a little movie.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.770
Unfortunately, no new
age music with this one.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.310
I apologize.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.940
So what's shown here
is a sphere immersed

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.310
in a bunch of water molecules.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.310
The red is the oxygen.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:01.415
The little white parts
are the hydrogens.

00:44:01.415 --> 00:44:02.790
You can see them
wiggling around.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.900
And what's the fundamental
feature that you observe?

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.800
All right, they're
forming almost a cage

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.420
around this
hydrophobic molecule.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.170
Why is that?

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:14.670
Yeah?

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.336
AUDIENCE: It's hard
for them to interact

00:44:16.336 --> 00:44:18.170
with a non-polar residue.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.819
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it's hard for them

00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:21.360
to interact with a
non-polar residue.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.332
So the water molecules
want to minimize

00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:24.290
their potential energy.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.070
They're going to
do that by forming

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.070
hydrogen bonds with something.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:31.310
In bulk solvent, they form it
with other water molecules.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:35.250
Here, they can't form any
hydrogen bonds with a sphere,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.440
so they have to dance to
this complicated dance

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.050
to try to form hydrogen
bonds with each other

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.680
with this thing stuck
in middle of them.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.540
And this is, at its heart,
the fundamental driving force

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.150
between the hydrophobic
effect, that

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.524
which causes the hydrophobic
residues to be buried inside

00:44:51.524 --> 00:44:52.870
of the protein.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.720
Very, very hard, as
I said, to simulate

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.770
using fundamental
physical forces.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.350
So what does the
statistician do?

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.730
The statistician has a mixture
of experimental observation

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:10.210
and statistics at
their benefit, so we

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:13.360
can measure how hydrophobic
any molecule is.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.190
We can take carbons and drop
them to non-polar solvents,

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.900
into polar solvents, and
determine what fraction of time

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.134
a molecule will spend
in a polar environment

00:45:23.134 --> 00:45:25.050
versus a non-polar
environment, and from that,

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.350
get a free energy for
the transfer of any atom

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.750
from a hydrophobic environment
to a hydrophilic environment.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:38.280
That can give us is delta
G Ref, shown over here.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.460
OK, now, in a
protein, that molecule

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.087
is not fully solvent exposed
even when it's on the surface,

00:45:46.087 --> 00:45:47.670
because water molecules
trying to come

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.420
at it from this direction
can't get to it,

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.240
from this direction
can't get to it.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.230
So the transfer
energy for this carbon

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.130
to go from fully solvent
exposed to buried

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:01.140
is different from
the isolated carbon.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.730
And so the statistician
says, OK, I'll

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.438
come up with a function
to describe that.

00:46:04.438 --> 00:46:07.910
I will describe what
else is near this atom

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.486
in the rest of the
protein structure.

00:46:09.486 --> 00:46:11.110
That's what the term
on the right does.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:14.507
It's a sum over all
other neighboring atoms

00:46:14.507 --> 00:46:16.590
and describes the volume
of the neighboring group.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.830
Is the thing next to it
really big or really small?

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:20.030
Usually not described,
necessarily,

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.946
at the level of atoms.

00:46:20.946 --> 00:46:22.510
It might be side
chains depending

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.180
on which program is doing it.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.530
But I have some measure of
the volume of the neighbors.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.488
If that volume is really
large, then this thing

00:46:28.488 --> 00:46:30.420
is already in a
hydrophobic environment

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.150
even when it's taking
water because it's

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.130
surrounded by bulky things.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:35.700
If the neighbors
are small, then it's

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.620
a more hydrophilic environment
when it's taking in water,

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.870
and that's going to
modulate this free energy.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.810
Is this function clear?

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:51.440
OK, so by combining this
observation from small molecule

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.257
transfer experiments
and these observations

00:46:54.257 --> 00:46:55.840
based on the structure
of the protein,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.600
we can get an approximation
for the hydrophobic effect.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.310
How expensive is it
to have this piece

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.644
of the protein in solvent
versus in the hydrophobic core?

00:47:03.644 --> 00:47:05.810
And again, we never had to
do any quantum mechanical

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:06.510
calculations.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.354
We never had to actually
explicitly compute

00:47:08.354 --> 00:47:10.270
the interaction of this
molecule with solvent.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:13.164
We don't need any
water in the structure.

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:15.080
It's simply the geometry
of the protein that's

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.340
going to give us a good
approximation to the energy

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.820
function.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.950
All right, so you can look
through all the details

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.200
of these online in the
Rosetta documentation

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.430
that we provided to get
a better sense of what

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.300
all these functions
are, but you can

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.480
see there are a lot of terms.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.011
It's increasingly incremental.

00:47:34.011 --> 00:47:35.760
You find something
wrong with your models.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.650
You add a term to try
to account for that.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.690
Again, not driven necessarily
by the physical forces.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.470
OK, so what have we seen so far?

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.180
We've seen the
motivation for this unit,

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.710
to begin with
protein structures,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.085
that the protein
structure really

00:47:48.085 --> 00:47:50.700
helps us understand the
biological molecules that we're

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.755
looking at.

00:47:51.755 --> 00:47:54.130
These structures are going to
influence our understanding

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.760
of all biology, so we need
to be good at predicting

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.830
these protein structures
or solving them

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:02.160
when we have experimental data.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.862
The computational
methods that we're

00:48:03.862 --> 00:48:05.320
going to use--
we're going to focus

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.652
on solving protein structures
de novo, predicting them,

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:09.110
but those same
techniques are going

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:10.740
to underlie the
methods that are used

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.264
to solve x-ray
crystallography in an MR.

00:48:13.264 --> 00:48:15.430
And fundamentally then, we
have these two approaches

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.630
to describing the
potential energy.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:21.310
That's the statistician and
the physicist's approach.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.400
And remember, the
key simplifications

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.330
of the statistician are that
we used a fixed geometry.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.960
We're not trying to
figure out the XYZ

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.230
coordinates of every atom.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.800
We're simply trying to
figure out the bond angles.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.440
We're going to use
rotamers, so we're

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.320
going to turn our
continuous choices often

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.190
into discrete ones.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.190
And we're going to derive
statistical potentials

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.950
to present the potential
energy, which may or may not

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.994
have a clear physical basis.

00:48:44.994 --> 00:48:47.410
All right, so let's start with
a little thought experiment

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.200
as we try to get into some of
these prediction algorithms.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.620
So I have a sequence.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.700
It's about, I don't know,
100 amino acids long,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.270
and here are two
protein structures.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.980
One is predominantly
alpha helical.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.620
One is predominantly beta sheet.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.859
How could I tell-- this is
not a rhetorical question.

00:49:00.859 --> 00:49:02.150
I want you to think for second.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:05.117
How could I tell whether
the sequence prefers

00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:07.450
the structure on the top or
the structure on the bottom?

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.650
So we have, actually, a
lot of the tools in place.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:14.530
Yes, in the back.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.480
AUDIENCE: Can you, based on
previously known sequences,

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.945
know which sequence is
predominant in which

00:49:22.945 --> 00:49:23.950
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.100
PROFESSOR: OK, so
the answer was we

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.395
could look at previously
known sequences.

00:49:28.395 --> 00:49:30.270
We can look for homology,
and that's actually

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.770
going to be a very
powerful tool.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:35.570
So if there is a homologue in
the database that is closely

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:39.390
related to this protein, and
it has a known structure,

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.810
then problem solved.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.340
What if there isn't?

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.400
What's my next step?

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.315
Yes?

00:49:46.315 --> 00:49:49.780
AUDIENCE: What if you
start with a description

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:55.720
of the secondary structure,
say the helices and the sheet,

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.175
and you counted how often a
particular amino acid showed up

00:50:00.175 --> 00:50:02.650
in each of those structures?

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.850
Could you then compute
maybe a likelihood

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.702
across a stretch of amino acids?

00:50:07.702 --> 00:50:08.410
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.430
So that answer was
what if I looked

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.880
at these alpha helices
and beta sheets

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.850
and computed how often
certain amino acids occur

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.050
in alpha helices
versus beta sheets,

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.932
and then I looked in
my protein structure

00:50:20.932 --> 00:50:23.140
and checked whether I have
the right amino acids that

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.348
are more favorable than
alpha helices or beta sheets.

00:50:25.348 --> 00:50:28.220
And we'll see that's an approach
that's been used successfully.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.420
That's secondary
structure prediction.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.910
OK, other ideas.

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.300
Yep?

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.670
AUDIENCE: So if you have the
position of the 3D structure,

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.670
you can feed your sequence
through the structure

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.100
and then put it through
your energy function,

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.285
see which one is the
lower [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:46.285 --> 00:50:47.160
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.280
So another thing I can do is, if
I have these two structures, I

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.450
have their precise
three-dimensional structures,

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.010
I could try to put my
sequence onto that structure,

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.590
actually put the right
side chains for my sequence

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.189
into that backbone confirmation.

00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:03.230
And then what would I do?

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.710
I would actually measure
the potential energy

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:09.170
of the protein in top structure
and the potential energy

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.110
of the protein in
the bottom structure.

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.630
If the potential
energy is higher,

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.360
is that the favorable structure
or the unfavorable structure?

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.990
Favorable?

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.074
Unfavorable?

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:19.240
Right, it's the unfavorable.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.460
So I want the lower
free energy structure.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.480
OK, so let's think
about-- that's correct,

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.759
and that's where we're headed.

00:51:26.759 --> 00:51:28.800
But what are going to be
some of the complexities

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.020
of that approach?

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.980
So first of all, what
about these side chains?

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.330
I have to now take a
backbone structure that

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.399
had some other amino
acid sequence on it,

00:51:38.399 --> 00:51:40.190
and I have to put these
new side chains on.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.140
Right?

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.030
If I put those on in the
wrong way-- let's say,

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.224
this is the true one--
let's say one of these

00:51:47.224 --> 00:51:48.140
is the true structure.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.730
Let's begin with
a simplification.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.809
All right, so let's say your
fiendish labmate has actually

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.350
solved the structure
of your protein,

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.090
but refuses tell you
what the answer is.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.350
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.810
PROFESSOR: And she actually
has solved two structures,

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.500
neither one of which she's going
to give you the sequence to.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.020
But she's giving you the
coordinates for both of them.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.330
They're the same length.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.090
And so she asks you,
ha, you took 791.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.350
You can figure this out.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.581
Tell me whether that
your sequence is actually

00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:15.080
in this structure
or that structure.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.010
She says one of them
is exactly right.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.510
You just don't know which one.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.510
OK, so she gives you the
backbone coordinates,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:21.080
so you go.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.320
You put your amino
acid sequence, say,

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:28.070
with Swiss [? PDB. ?] You add to
the backbone all the right side

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:28.570
chains.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.486
But now, you have to
make a bunch of decisions

00:52:30.486 --> 00:52:32.990
for these side
chain confirmations.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.710
If you make the wrong
decision, what happens?

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:39.350
Well, you stick this atom close
to where some other atom is.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:41.820
Now, you've got an
optimization problem, right?

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.410
You believe that one
of these backbone

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.826
coordinates is
correct, but you've

00:52:44.826 --> 00:52:47.970
got a very highly coupled
optimization problem.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:51.560
You need to figure out the right
rotations for every single side

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.040
chain on this protein, and
you can't do it one by one.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.026
You can't take a greedy approach
because if I put this side

00:52:57.026 --> 00:52:59.400
chain here, and I put this
side chain here, they collide,

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.230
but if this was wrong and
supposed to be over there,

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.740
then maybe this is the
right conformation.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.640
So I have a coupled
problem, so it turns out

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.550
to be computationally
expensive thing to compute.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.380
So we're going to look at
what to do if we know backbone

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.080
confirmation, but we don't know
the side chain confirmation.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.996
We can try to solve that
optimization problem,

00:53:15.996 --> 00:53:18.190
and you'll actually do
that in your problem set.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.000
Now, what if the
backbone confirmation

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.570
isn't exactly correct?

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.470
So let's say you do what
was first suggested,

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.630
and you search the
sequence database.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:28.660
You take this sequence, and
you find that it actually

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.360
has two homologs, two
things with similar sequence

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.210
similarity.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:34.550
There are two proteins
with 20% sequence identity

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:37.210
that have completely
different structures.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.770
This one has 20%
sequence identity,

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.960
and this one has 20%
sequence identity.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.970
So you have no way of deciding
which one's which, right?

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:47.190
And neither one is going to be
the right protein structure.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.786
So you know that by putting the
side chains onto these protein

00:53:49.786 --> 00:53:52.410
structures, you do have to solve
those problems with side chain

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.430
optimization, but what,
obviously, is the other thing

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.221
that you're going to
need to have to solve?

00:53:57.112 --> 00:53:59.320
All right, you're going to
need to solve the backbone

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.710
optimization problem, and
this becomes even more

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:05.040
coupled because when
I move this backbone,

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.860
then the side
chains move with it.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.110
So now, I've got a very,
very complicated optimization

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:09.985
problem to deal with.

00:54:09.985 --> 00:54:13.790
The search space is enormous,
and even if I discretize it,

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:15.560
it's still very, very large.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.160
In fact, there's
something famous

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.530
called the Levinthal Paradox.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:20.540
Of course, Cy
Levinthal, who was once

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.180
upon a time a professor here
and then moved to Columbia--

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.380
he did a back of the
envelope calculation

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.110
for extremely simple models
of protein structure.

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.560
If you imagine the proteins
were to randomly search over

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.710
all possible confirmations
with very rapid switching

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.180
between possible
confirmations, it

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.060
would take basically
the lifetime

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.240
of the universe for a
protein to ever fold.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.030
So proteins don't
do random searches

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.590
over all possible confirmations,
and they can check out

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.426
confirmations
incredibly rapidly.

00:54:47.426 --> 00:54:49.050
So we certainly can't
do that, so we'll

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.224
look at the
optimization techniques.

00:54:52.224 --> 00:54:55.920
All right, so we discussed
how to use energy optimization

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.610
functions to try to decide
which one's correct,

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:03.107
and that even if the
structure is the correct one,

00:55:03.107 --> 00:55:04.940
we have the side chain
optimization problem.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.940
If the structure's the incorrect
one, we've got two problems.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.570
We've got the backbone
confirmation and the side

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.270
chain.

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:12.470
This is frequently called
fold recognition or threading.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:14.460
This choice of, you've
got a protein structure.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.780
You want to decide if
your sequence matches

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.120
this one or that one.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.620
There are a couple
of other problems

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.150
that we're going to look at.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:26.260
So this was already raised by
one of the students, the idea

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.292
that we try to predict
the secondary structure

00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:30.500
of this protein, so we'll
look at secondary structure

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.860
prediction algorithms.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.110
This was a very early area
of computational effort

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:38.220
in structural
biology, and we'll see

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.574
that the early methods
are remarkably good.

00:55:41.574 --> 00:55:42.990
We can look for
domain structures,

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.540
and this is really
a sequence problem.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.081
So we can look
through our sequences,

00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:48.680
and rather than looking for
sequence identity or similarity

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.080
with known
structures, we can see

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.690
whether there are
certain patterns,

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:53.273
like the hidden
Markov models that you

00:55:53.273 --> 00:55:54.980
looked at in a
previous lecture, that

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.660
can allow us to recognize the
domain structure of a protein

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:02.120
even without an identical
sequence in the database.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.874
So we won't go over that
kind of analysis anymore,

00:56:04.874 --> 00:56:06.290
and then we'll
spend a good amount

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.510
of time looking at ways of
solving novel structures.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:10.810
So if you don't have a
fiendish friend who solved

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.110
your structure for you,
and there is no homologue

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.930
in the database,
all is not lost.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:18.424
You actually can now predict
novel structures of proteins

00:56:18.424 --> 00:56:19.465
simply from the sequence.

00:56:22.085 --> 00:56:25.260
All right, so a little
history as to the prediction

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.320
of protein structure.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.995
It really starts
with Linus Pauling,

00:56:28.995 --> 00:56:32.010
who went on to win the
Nobel Prize for this work.

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.940
And this is in the era-- this
paper was published in 1951.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.960
This was what computers
looked like in 1951,

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.960
and that thing probably
has a lot less computing

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.640
power than your iPhone
or your Android.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.140
So Linus Pauling did
not solve the structure

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.040
of the alpha helix, predict
that alpha helices existed,

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.785
using computers.

00:56:51.785 --> 00:56:54.680
He actually did it
entirely with paper models.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.220
And in fact, he solved this--
he got the key insights

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.780
for the alpha helix when
he was lying sick in bed.

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.600
That's a very productive sick
leave, you might imagine.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.840
He was using paper
models, but it

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.330
wasn't all done
while lying in bed.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.460
So he and others,
the field as a whole,

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.520
have spend a lot of time
observing small molecule

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.490
distances, so they
have some idea what

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:18.929
to expect in protein structures.

00:57:18.929 --> 00:57:20.970
They didn't know the
three-dimensional structure,

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.511
but they knew a lot
of the parameters

00:57:22.511 --> 00:57:23.940
about how far apart things were.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.542
And they also knew
that hydrogen bonds

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.500
were going to be extremely
favorable in protein

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.360
structures.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.320
And so he looked for
a repeating structure

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.940
that would maximize the
number of hydrogen bonds

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.930
that occur within the
protein backbone chain.

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:43.610
And he knew, also, the
backbone-- that the amide bonds

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:44.860
would be planar and so on.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.810
So there were a lot of
principle that underlay this,

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:50.290
but it was really
a tour de force

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.010
of just thinking
rather than computing.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.990
Another really important
contribution early on

00:57:54.990 --> 00:58:00.150
was made by Ramachandran,
was at Madras University,

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.180
and his insight had
to do with the fact

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.940
that not all backbone
confirmations were

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.690
equally favorable.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.606
So remember, we have
these two rotatable bonds

00:58:06.606 --> 00:58:07.510
in the backbone.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.200
We have the phi angle
and the psi angle.

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.150
And this plot
shows that there'll

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:16.250
be certain confirmations
of phi and psi angles

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.430
that are observed within
these dashed lines,

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:22.320
and then the other
confirmations, which are almost

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.947
never observed.

00:58:23.947 --> 00:58:25.280
Now, how did he figure that out?

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.240
Once again, it wasn't
with computation.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.350
It was simply with paper
models and figuring out

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.677
what the distances would be, and
then carefully reasoning over

00:58:32.677 --> 00:58:33.760
those possible structures.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.620
So you can get very far in
this field, initially, back

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:39.450
then, by simple hard thought.

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:40.909
OK, so with these
two observations,

00:58:40.909 --> 00:58:42.366
we knew that there
were going to be

00:58:42.366 --> 00:58:44.260
certain kinds of regular
secondary structure

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.520
and that not all
backbone confirmations

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.040
were equally favorable.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.740
OK, but now, we want to advance
actually predicting structures

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.670
of particular proteins, not just
saying that proteins in general

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:55.810
will contain alpha helices.

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.480
So how do we go
about doing that?

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.090
So the first
advances here, we're

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:01.990
trying to predict the
structure of alpha helices,

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.910
and this paper in
the 1960s introduced

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.770
the concept of a helical wheel.

00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:09.870
Now, the idea here,
if you'll imagine

00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:13.430
that this eraser
is an alpha helix,

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.820
I'm going to look down the
backbone of the alpha helix.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.440
And I'll see that
the side chains

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.150
emerge at regular positions.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:21.990
There's going to be
100 degree rotation

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:25.680
between each sequential
residue in the backbone

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.200
as it goes around helix.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.580
It's going to be displaced
and rotated by 100 degrees,

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.510
and I could plot,
on a piece of paper,

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.749
the helical projection,
which is shown here.

00:59:36.749 --> 00:59:38.040
So here's the first amino acid.

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.770
100 degrees later, the second.

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.440
100 degrees later, the third.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.720
And I can ask whether the
residues on that backbone

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.250
have a sequence that
puts all the hydrophobics

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.410
and hydrophilics on the
same side, as in this case,

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:53.784
or on different sides.

00:59:53.784 --> 00:59:55.200
Now, what difference
does it make?

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.741
Well, if I have an
alpha helix that's

00:59:56.741 --> 01:00:00.430
lying on the surface
of a protein,

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.540
this could have one side
that's solvent exposed and one

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.350
side that's protected.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.040
So we would expect that some
of these alpha helices lying

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.100
on the service would
be amphipathic.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.440
Half of them would be
hydrophobic, hydrophobic,

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.220
and half of them
would be hydrophilic.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.340
And purely, as someone
suggested from the pattern

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.220
of the amino acids, and here the
hydrophobicity of the pattern

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.330
of the amino acids, we could
make reasonable predictions

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:27.000
of whether this protein forms a
particular kind of alpha helix,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.080
an amphipathic alpha helix.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.334
Now, is that going to help
us for all alpha helices?

01:00:32.334 --> 01:00:34.500
Obviously not, because I
can have alpha helices that

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.440
are totally solvent
exposed, and I

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.575
can have alpha helices
that are totally protected.

01:00:39.575 --> 01:00:41.950
So this pattern will occur in
some alpha helices, but not

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:42.720
all.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.520
So another idea
that was raised here

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.151
and was used early
on with great success

01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:49.400
was to actually figure out
whether certain amino acids

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.860
have a particular alpha
helical propensity.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.270
Do they occur more
frequently in alpha helices?

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.340
At the time, it was
also thought maybe

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.131
you could find propensities
for beta sheets

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.260
and other structures.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.600
So compute the statistics
over for every amino acid,

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.450
shown as a row here.

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.160
How often is it observed
in the database?

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.150
How often does it
occur in alpha helix?

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:11.450
And how often does it occur
in beta sheet or in a coil?

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.110
And from these, then, we
would compute probabilities

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:17.510
and compute using, perhaps,
Bayesian statistics to compute

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.524
the poster
expectation for having

01:01:20.524 --> 01:01:21.940
a certain sequence
in alpha helix.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.130
They didn't quite use
Bayesian statistics here.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:28.254
They came up with a
rather ad hoc approach,

01:01:28.254 --> 01:01:29.670
and when you read
it in hindsight,

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:30.930
it seems kind of crazy.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:31.850
But actually, you
have to remember

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.940
when this was being done.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.330
This is being done before a
big influence of mathematicians

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.120
into structural biology.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.849
This is 1974, and they used
more physical reasoning.

01:01:41.849 --> 01:01:43.640
They knew something
about how alpha helices

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.960
formed from chemistry.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.390
They knew that,
typically, there's

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:49.610
nucleation event, where a small
piece of helix forms initially,

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.257
and then that extends.

01:01:51.257 --> 01:01:53.090
They knew that there
were these propensities

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.280
for certain amino acids
to form alpha helices,

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.820
and other amino acids, which
tended to break the helix.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.080
And they came up with
an ad hoc algorithm

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.980
that counted how often
you had strong helix

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.300
formers, how often you breakers.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.180
You can see all the
details in the references.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.700
The amazing thing is, with this
very ad hoc thing and a very,

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.464
very small database
of protein structures,

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:15.380
you could look at the
total number of residues

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.380
that they're looking at
over all the structures,

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.320
there's 2,473 and
residues, not structures.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.680
And now, we have
many, many more times

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.160
than that of
structures of proteins.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.820
Even with that,
in 1974, they were

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.420
able to achieve 60%
accuracy in predicting

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.080
the secondary
structure of proteins,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.320
so it's really an
astounding accomplishment.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.570
And to put that in
perspective, there

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.750
was an evaluation of a whole
bunch of secondary structure

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.220
prediction algorithms
done about a decade ago,

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.740
and things haven't changed
that much since then, where

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:50.820
between 1974 and
2003, almost 30 years,

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.200
they went from 60%
accuracy to 76% accuracy.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.905
OK, well, that's not
bad, but it's not a lot

01:02:57.905 --> 01:02:59.530
for-- you'd expect
maybe over 30 years,

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.200
you could do a lot better.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.110
So the simple approach
really captured

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:06.696
the fundamentals of predicting
secondary structure.

01:03:06.696 --> 01:03:08.570
There's a lot of work
that's been done since,

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.361
and I encourage you to
look in the textbook

01:03:10.361 --> 01:03:13.020
if you're interested, to look
at all the newer algorithms that

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.270
have tried to solve the
secondary structure prediction

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.310
problem.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.204
OK.

01:03:19.204 --> 01:03:21.370
All right, so secondary
structure prediction, then--

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:23.536
you can look in the textbook
for the modern methods,

01:03:23.536 --> 01:03:26.050
but the fundamental ideas were
laid down by Chou and Fasman

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:28.500
in the 1974 paper.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.420
We're already said that looking
at the kinds of approaches

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.240
that we discussed
earlier in the course

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.984
can help you solve
domain structures.

01:03:34.984 --> 01:03:37.150
I would like to focus on,
at the end of this lecture

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.733
and the beginning-- and the next
lecture about how to actually

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:43.457
solve novel structures from
purely amino acid sequence,

01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:45.040
and we're going to
go back to the idea

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.790
that there is a potential
energy function.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:50.390
We now have both the CHARMM
approach and the Rosetta

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:53.930
approach to protein
structure, and so there

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:55.450
is some protein
folding landscape.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:56.701
There's an energy function.

01:03:56.701 --> 01:03:58.200
If you have different
conformations,

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.580
you'll be at different
positions in landscape,

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.710
and we'd like to
figure out how to go

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:06.310
from some starting confirmation
that may be arbitrary and find

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.080
our way to the minimum
energy structure.

01:04:14.489 --> 01:04:18.620
All right, so there are going
to be three fundamental things

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.210
that we'll talk about
in the next lecture.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:23.840
We're going to talk about
energy minimization,

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.300
how to use these potential
energy functions that we

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.250
started off with to go
from approximate structures

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.640
to the refined structure.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.380
That's the thought
problem I gave you.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.120
You have the structure, but
you have the wrong side chains.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.470
Could you minimize them?

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:38.280
And so that's making
small changes.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.960
We'll discuss
molecular dynamics,

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.552
which actually tries to simulate
all the forces on a protein

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:46.510
and to actually carry
out a physical simulation

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:47.279
of the process.

01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:48.820
That's the CHARMM
approach, and we'll

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.589
see some interesting
variants on that.

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:53.630
And then we'll look at
simulated annealing, which

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.005
is an optimization technique
that's actually quite broad,

01:04:56.005 --> 01:04:57.490
but can be applied
here, to search

01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.770
over large, large
conformational spaces,

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.860
much further than a protein
would actually evolve

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.560
in a molecular dynamic
simulation that's

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.855
simulating protein function.

01:05:04.855 --> 01:05:07.230
You allow the protein, now,
to jump between confirmations

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.790
that have no real
potential to transfer

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:14.220
between in a normal room
temperature in water,

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.580
but can be done, obviously,
easily in the computer.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.480
So I'll stop here.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.010
Any questions before we close?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.500
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so we're going to try to--

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.450
I was giving a little bit
more time for more people

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.910
to show up--

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.070
chat about what did we
cover this semester.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.010
So I'm going to
try to talk about--

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920
we started out--
money and ledgers,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.520
and why does that matter, and
if you go away from all this.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.820
Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation--
what is that again?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.250
The economics of
blockchain technology,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.400
why the financial sector is
so entwined in all of this,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.780
though it's not the
only place we're going.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.790
A little bit about crypto
finance and public policy

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.680
frameworks, and then wrap
it up with a quote from Ben

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.620
Franklin-- will be the last
thing we talk about at the end,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.790
about paying it forward.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.020
I don't know how
many people read

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.690
the article I wrote
for Coin Desk, which

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.520
will run in a day
or two or something,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.430
but that, too, just like helped
me wrap up the whole semester.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
As I told you, I'm neither a
maximalist or a minimalist,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.260
but in a few
minutes, I'm probably

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.570
going to ask you all to kind of
let me know where you ended up.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.860
So the role of money.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.800
Anybody remember
the role of money

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.570
in an economy, the three things?

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:48.730
AUDIENCE: Medium of
exchange, unit of account,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.990
store of value.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.360
GARY GENSLER: Medium of
exchange, unit of account,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.350
store of value.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.910
I don't think we
really know, when

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.360
we go through all the history
and the archeology of it,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.660
which came first, but
all three really matter.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.160
So how many people
think that Bitcoin--

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.060
just Bitcoin.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.940
I'm not talking about
the other 1,600 tokens--

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.290
Bitcoin fulfills these
three roles of money?

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.635
James, was that a hand up?

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:22.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.077
Yep.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.410
GARY GENSLER: You're saying yes.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.815
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:26.690
GARY GENSLER: Alexis?

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.420
Oh, we got two.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.920
Hugo?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.090
Somebody take the other side.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.780
Tom?

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.060
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
GARY GENSLER: That's it?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.560
That's it?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.765
A whole semester, and
all you can say is nope?

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.750
GARY GENSLER: Nope?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.610
All right.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.990
Anybody want to give more?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.446
Brotish?

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.740
AUDIENCE: So not a store of
value because of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.280
GARY GENSLER: So Brotish
says not a store of value,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.310
but isn't it $60 billion
of value right now?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.610
So there is a value,
but it's too volatile.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.775
GARY GENSLER: James?

00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:03.210
AUDIENCE: I
respectfully disagree.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.360
It's volatile when you think
of it in exchange of a dollar,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.940
but if you move your
mindset, a bitcoin

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.290
is a bitcoin is a bitcoin.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.930
Right?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.818
It's only volatile if you
think [INAUDIBLE] a dollar.

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:16.860
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.050
Here we go.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.480
Ross?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.005
AUDIENCE: But that same
thing is true of corn, right?

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:24.680
A bushel of corn is--

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.722
I'm with Brotish on this.

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:27.097
GARY GENSLER: I'm
sorry, were you

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:28.920
in the no camp or the yes camp?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.150
That it's a store of value.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.230
AUDIENCE: I'm in the no camp.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.938
GARY GENSLER: No?

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:33.240
Is it a medium of exchange?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.050
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.290
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
medium of exchange.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.800
Sean?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.895
AUDIENCE: In response
to [INAUDIBLE] none

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:41.520
of the currency can
actually be treated

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.670
as a stand alone currency.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.780
Everything has to be
treated as a pair.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.460
So everything's a
relative comparison.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.720
So you can't really treat
Bitcoin on a standalone basis.

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:57.290
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if I agree with that.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.180
But I would say that pretty much
anything can fit into all three

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.000
of these buckets.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.430
It just depends on
how dependable it is.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.700
In those three buckets,
with US dollar's

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.710
very good at being
medium of exchange,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.690
very good at being a
dependable store of value,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.490
and a steady unit of account.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.867
But you could also have a
bushel of wheat or something.

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:18.450
It would be all three
of these things,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.320
but it wouldn't be equality.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.550
GARY GENSLER: Right, but--

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.519
please, Jihee.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.860
AUDIENCE: So the fiat
currency-- the reason why

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.910
I think US dollar is
stable is because there

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.650
is a US central bank that
actually backs up that.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.450
Because it's just
that fiat currency.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.900
It is a liability
of the central bank,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.998
whereas Bitcoin
doesn't have a center

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:42.040
to worry that banks have.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.774
GARY GENSLER: Nice music
that we're getting.

00:04:43.774 --> 00:04:44.710
[INAUDIBLE] a serenade.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.252
AUDIENCE: So therefore,
I don't think

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:48.363
the store of value
argument will work.

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:49.530
GARY GENSLER: So you think--

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.905
[INAUDIBLE] saying,
well, there's

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.310
no central bank behind it,
so maybe it doesn't hold up.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.120
But if you take anything
away from the class--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.630
and I'm going to have
some other takeaways, too.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.470
Remember, the three things
that about the role of money--

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.870
but it's a social construct.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.430
Even with a central bank--

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.970
a central bank is, ultimately--
we enshrined in law.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.420
We enshrine it in a big
institution, and bricks,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.770
and mortar, and columns usually.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.520
You always have to
have those columns.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.750
But it's still a
social construct.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.160
And Bitcoin does, in some
ways, have all three of these.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.260
It's just not
broadly acceptable.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.030
It's rarely used as
a unit of account,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.390
but it is sometimes
used as a unit account

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.100
in some initial coin offerings.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.180
It's not used, generally,
as a medium of exchange.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.460
But some people are
paid in Bitcoin some.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.010
Software developers are
actually paid in Bitcoin.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.030
And it's $60 billion.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.440
It might be volatile.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.460
It has a store value.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.900
So I'm not trying to take
maximalist or minimalist,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.660
but I'm probably
between Tom and James,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.290
because it does have
all of those qualities

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.390
in to some extent in there.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.440
Early money-- remember some
of our walk down memory lane.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.620
Some of these early monies
fell apart, became extinct,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.428
when they got debased.

00:06:24.428 --> 00:06:26.220
And we talked about,
early in the semester,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.900
even the story about it.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.990
It was, I think, a British--

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.960
when the British got
to the island of Yap,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.900
they went off a couple miles
and quarried the stones

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.450
and kept bringing
more yap stones there.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.240
And all of a sudden,
it got debased.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.710
And then, of course, money
turned to paper money.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.950
And in the bottom
left-hand corner,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.730
it started as
warehouse receipts.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.040
So the paper was
just a representation

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.630
of the store of value--

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.310
the metal, or the corn, or
the wheat that we had earlier.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.460
Another important
thing was ledgers.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.930
Who wants to remind the
class what a ledger is?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.510
Why do ledgers matter?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.310
Anybody want to-- ledgers?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.865
All right, clearly I
didn't make it on ledgers.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.605
Hugo?

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.780
AUDIENCE: It's transaction
history, basically.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.630
GARY GENSLER: A store
transaction history.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.620
What else is there?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.460
AUDIENCE: Balances.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.312
GARY GENSLER: Balances of?

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:30.640
AUDIENCE: Accounts.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.810
GARY GENSLER: Accounts.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.420
So it stores a balance
and a transaction.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.980
So you can think of it
as a flow and a balance.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.510
The flow is the transaction--

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.380
I give Hugo money.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.470
Regardless of who gives Hugo
money, here's his balance.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.410
So an income statement
and a balance sheet

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.210
is a flow and a balance.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.440
But ledgers and keeping ledgers
go back thousands of years.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.550
So blockchain technology
is really about money,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.860
but it's also about a
database that has ledgers.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.750
And ledgers usually
store things of value.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.130
So then we got to fiat currency.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.460
And fiat currency,
as Jihee said,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.440
they were represented by
central bank notes, central bank

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.285
reserves, and bank deposits.

00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:17.800
So there's three things.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.950
Does anybody want
to see if anybody

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.480
listened in those classes?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.130
[LAUGHS] I'm kidding around.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.680
Elan, you're going to say,
why is it those three things?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.872
They're all forms of fiat money.

00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:31.330
AUDIENCE: I thought
you were asking

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.950
about the illicit
activity in that list.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.980
Is that the question?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.480
GARY GENSLER: All right,
answer the question

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.340
you want to answer.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:38.965
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:39.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.335
[INAUDIBLE] there
are things that

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:45.466
are important in fiat
currency, or is helpful.

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:50.440
Fiat currency is important
for paying taxes.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.230
And it is allegedly backed
by the social understanding

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.707
that the central bank will
respect those notes at the end.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:01.540
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.850
So it's actually--
you're on to this.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.130
It's accepted for taxes.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.330
It's legal tender.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.283
So actually, society
gets together,

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:11.200
through its parliament,
through its executive,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.740
and passes a law that
says it's legal tender.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.280
That gives it a huge leg up.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.440
But this is what
it's really about.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.900
It has huge network effects.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.890
And I wrote this in
the CoinDesk article.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.440
The question I have
for any new currency

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.780
is, how does it compete with
those incredible network

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.250
effects?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.400
And we talk about Facebook
has incredible network effects

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.510
because--

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.400
two billion members.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.880
But even money, as a
technology, has a network effect

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.090
because people readily accept
it as a unit of account,

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.480
a medium of exchange,
a store of value.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.200
And it only loses that
network effect, usually,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.050
when it gets
debased, when people

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.840
can't be confident that
it's a good store of value

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.240
because somebody else
can mint a lot of it,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:06.170
or print a lot of it, or a king
starts to print too much of it.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.380
But it has an extraordinary
network effect.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.030
On the other hand,
sometimes currencies

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.850
are a little bit challenged,
like the euro right now.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.930
Will the euro ultimately work?

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.230
That's for a different class
and a different lecture,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.650
but will the euro
ultimately work long term?

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.300
I have my doubts whether it
will work for decades to come,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.620
because there's so
many jurisdictions.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.230
And there's not a
unified fiscal account,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:40.790
not a unified economy, and not
truly free movement of labor

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.850
across that continent.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.590
So that's fiat currency.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.970
It's sort of the game in town
that then Satoshi Nakamoto

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.070
is was addressing.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.900
And you all read the
eight-page paper,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.540
but that was the first line.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.218
"Been working on a
new electronic cash

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.260
system that's fully
peer-to-peer, with no trusted

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.280
third party."

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.470
Basically, as Jihee
said, no central bank.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.450
Forget about that central bank.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:12.000
That was the core
inspiration that was there.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.180
But interestingly, it
wasn't the first try.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.160
And we talked early
in the semester

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.730
about at least a handful
of early attempts

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.400
that all failed
because they were still

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.320
centralized-- like DigiCash
was still very centralized.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.870
Or they couldn't solve
the double spending.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.510
On the internet, you
can send an email twice.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.090
It doesn't need a
central authority.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.620
So what if it gets copied?

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.140
But the double spending
is the big issue.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.940
So how did he solve
it, or she solve it?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.060
Does anybody still not know
who Satoshi Nakamoto is?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.560
No?

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.820
All right.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.290
I was hoping, I was hoping.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.160
So we talked about
blocks of data

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.655
using cryptography
and consensus.

00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:10.280
So if you're at a
dinner party, and you

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.767
can't remember anything else
from this class, [LAUGHS]

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.350
maybe just remember,
oh, yeah, there's

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.570
something about blocks of data
using a bunch of cryptography

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.560
and consensus.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.910
These slides are on Canvas.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.350
Download this one slide,
you're the expert.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.745
Neha Nerula actually
created this slide,

00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:32.060
and I've been using it a lot.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.420
But anybody remember who
invented this whole concept

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.550
of blocks of data?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.470
James?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.640
AUDIENCE: Adam someone?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.140
Back?

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.765
GARY GENSLER: Adam
Back is a good name,

00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:46.140
but he's not the guy
that invented this.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.972
He invented something else,
which was proof-of-work.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.600
Timestamp append-only
logs-- what's

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.840
the longest running
blockchain in the world?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.100
AUDIENCE: New York Times?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.655
GARY GENSLER: New York Times.

00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:00.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.433
AUDIENCE: Crossword.

00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:05.700
GARY GENSLER: All
right, here he is.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.480
So two Bell Labs scientists--
this is one of them.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.560
Two Bell Labs scientists
came up with this concept

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.000
that you could take a bunch
of data, put it through what's

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.320
called a cryptographic
hash function,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.637
and that's a commitment scheme.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.970
You couldn't change it, because
if you changed anything,

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.360
the hash function would change.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.430
So what's a cryptographic
hash function?

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.350
That's when I use
this idea of you

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.080
can take the entire
library of Congress,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.780
and put it into a little
thing called a hash function,

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.150
and end up with a
string of characters,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:52.280
a hexadecimal output.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:59.790
But a hash function is the key
to what this guy figured out.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.660
And, of course, this.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.370
That's the key.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.890
There was only two
bits of cryptography

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.660
in this whole class.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.710
And I know that it seemed like,
oh, why are we teaching this?

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.870
But it's this idea that you
can take a whole bunch of data,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.810
put it into this thing
called a hash function,

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.340
and it commits to it.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.520
Because if you change
any piece of the data--

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.700
any individual
piece-- you're going

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.380
to get a different output.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.928
And so it's really the key to
it is that it commits something.

00:14:32.928 --> 00:14:35.220
You can do it with the New
York Times crossword puzzle,

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:41.490
and that was just my
observation on it.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.380
So it's about data commitment.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.860
The other thing that
Satoshi Nakamoto used

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.750
was asymmetric cryptography,
or digital signatures.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.660
I pulled one of the graphics
that we talked about.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.850
But the idea being that,
long ago, cryptography

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.980
was, how do I encrypt
something because I'm

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.910
in a military campaign?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.520
And I would, maybe,
just transpose.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.550
The simplest cryptography
from thousands of years

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.550
ago was transposing
every letter.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.130
An A becomes a B,
a B becomes a C.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.740
That would be a
transposition of one.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.640
Well, that's pretty hard to
imagine that anybody got away

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.140
with that.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.990
But that was early cryptography,
thousands of years ago-- just

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.780
simple transposition.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.330
By the mid-20th
century, there was

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.150
very complex
transpositions, which

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.240
were called keys and enigma.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.900
If you ever go back and watch
that movie Imitation Games,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.110
there was five metal rotors--

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.910
they were electronic rotors--

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.160
that changed.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.110
And every day, the Germans
would change the five rotors.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.900
But still, they were
symmetric cryptography.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.900
The U boats actually
had the same five rotors

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.440
as high command out of--

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.070
Berlin, let's say.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.510
So somebody came
along in the 1970s

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.220
and said, what if
the key is different?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.210
It's asymmetric.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.140
There's a private
key, and a public key.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.550
The public key, everybody gets,
but the private key, you keep.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.800
And some of those
computer sites--

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.680
cryptographers-- are
here, right here, at MIT.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.730
Ron Rivest teaches a
course in cryptography.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.440
But that invention, in
the 1970s, is really key.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.520
So it's hash functions,
and this concept

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.110
of a private key
and a public key,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.500
and of course a digital
signature that goes with it.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.040
You probably don't even need to
remember much about this class

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.557
about this.

00:16:46.557 --> 00:16:48.140
But just know there's
something called

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.810
a private key and a public key.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.740
And then, Nakamoto's
real innovation

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.480
was off of Adam Back.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.340
And Adam Back said, if I use
some computational work--

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.210
if I use computational work
to find a hash function that

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.930
has a predetermined
number of zeros,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.310
it's not much of a puzzle.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.380
It's a random number generation.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.099
People will say proof-of-work
is a computational puzzle.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.150
It is simply running--

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.770
this thing called mining
is running-- electricity

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.454
until you get the right
number of leading zeros.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.270
But it can be
efficiently verified.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.810
So the characteristics of
proof-of-work is of work is--

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.760
invented in 1997.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.360
Blockchains were
invented in 1991.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.700
But what Satoshi Nakamoto--

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.500
what she did was she pulled that
together after like 20 or 30

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.180
failed attempts to have a
digital, non-central money

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.930
and said, that that's where
blockchain inspiration is.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.200
And so proof of work--

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.650
I use this little visual.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:06.430
But each block-- do you
remember what the word nonce is?

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.760
What's a nonce?

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.350
Ross?

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.000
Make me proud, somebody.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.665
Can't remember.

00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:14.467
AUDIENCE: And once.

00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:15.550
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.930
AUDIENCE: And once.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.865
GARY GENSLER: And
once-- a number once.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:19.990
AUDIENCE: Number used once.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.668
AUDIENCE: Once.

00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:21.960
GARY GENSLER: Number used once.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.070
And so why is a nonce
important for proof of work?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.800
AUDIENCE: Because
it's a unique number.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.450
GARY GENSLER: It's
a unique number.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.810
AUDIENCE: And so
establishing the integrity

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.920
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.200
GARY GENSLER: So all this
whole proof of work--

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.930
I'm just going back as a review,
but the whole proof of work

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.930
is your computer is
going to randomly keep

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.080
picking one thing that changes.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.630
All the data, all the
transactions are the same,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.730
but keep changing this
thing called a nonce

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.320
until I get some
leading number of zeros.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.740
And the whole Bitcoin
network around the globe--

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.860
all it's really doing is running
a random number generation,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.180
or nonces, until
the hash function

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.600
is solved to have 18
leading zeros right now.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.950
Or I should say--

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:20.668
18 leading zeros when Bitcoin's
value was $6,500 a Bitcoin.

00:19:20.668 --> 00:19:22.210
It wouldn't surprise
me if it's going

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.190
to fall down to 17 leading
zeros, or 16 leading zeros,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.860
because that would
make it easier to find.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.690
All of that cryptography is just
to make the database structure.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:42.290
This database structure
that is in blockchain--

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.560
to make this work.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.860
All that cryptography of hash
functions, digital signatures,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.440
and a little proof
of work is to make it

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.010
what's called nearly immutable.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.590
And I'm putting the word
"nearly" in because nothing's

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.590
truly immutable.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.770
You could overwhelm even
the Bitcoin network.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.745
Questions about the technology?

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:05.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.930
AUDIENCE: Could you just go
over the number of leading zeros

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.510
concept again?

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:15.800
GARY GENSLER: So the concept
behind the proof of work

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:25.560
that Adam Back came up with
in the late 1990s was--

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.780
gotta run some data
through a hash function.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.020
In his case, in Adam
Back's case, it was emails.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.030
Literally run an email all the
way through a hash function,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.810
and then add an additional
bit of data to it--

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.930
this nonce, a number
that's used once--

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:51.890
and run that nonce randomly
until the hash that comes out.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.700
And my little
visual at the bottom

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.790
there has some
leading zeros to it.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.360
AUDIENCE: So
beginning of the hash

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.610
will be its number of zeros?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.360
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.350
So in this case,
four leading zeros--

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.790
in that little visual there.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.280
All the data that
goes into a block--

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.960
in Bitcoin, 1,000 to 1,500
transactions all go in.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.360
They're rolled up in this
thing called a Merkle tree,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.700
but it all goes in.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.440
And the only thing
that's changing

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.580
is the miners are trying
to find a random nonce

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.810
until the hash has certain
number of leading zeros.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.580
When Nakamoto wrote the paper,
the difficulty was, I think,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.630
10 leading zeros.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.815
And you could solve
that on a laptop.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.280
With eight more leading zeros--

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.320
and since it's hexadecimal--

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.700
I guess it's 16 to
the eighth power

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:04.477
harder, or something like
seven trillion times harder.

00:22:04.477 --> 00:22:05.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.580
AUDIENCE: Let's assume
that you and I were trying

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.640
to have a transaction today.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.849
And I'm going to
keep some coins.

00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:22.060
And I'm [INAUDIBLE]
these for everyone

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.120
who's transacting
many, many times

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.370
and adding layers of difficulty
to the transaction that we had.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:35.210
If I want to use my
balance in five years,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.800
how do we know
what my balance is?

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.000
I need to go back
through all the history

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.250
to know that I have a balance?

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.350
GARY GENSLER: So at the heart
of the blockchain technology,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.410
the Bitcoin network, but
also all the other networks,

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.130
is the entire transaction
history is public.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.230
This both gives us its
strength, but it's also

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.870
one of its challenges.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.470
And so, yes, even
five years from now,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:08.300
if you want to use
one of your Bitcoins--

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.680
which are stored
on the blockchain--

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.890
you have to be able to show
that here is a transaction

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.390
output from five years ago.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:21.710
If you remember, there is both
transaction output models--

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.480
Bitcoin is a system that keeps
all the individual transactions

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.780
in a set called the UTXO--

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.920
the Unspent
Transaction Output Set.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.300
You'd have to be able to show
that you have that in 25 years,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.050
you said?

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:44.200
2023-- in 2023, you'd have
to be able to show that.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.810
AUDIENCE: So it's
also a balance.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:51.260
They all spent this balance
in the transaction [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.060
a record.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.270
GARY GENSLER: It is
a record of an output

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.830
from an individual transaction.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.620
So yes, it is like a balance.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.610
But because Bitcoin does not
add up all of those individual--

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.410
if you had 13
individual outputs,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.450
the Bitcoin network will
not add up those 13.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:21.226
You'd have to use each of those
individually as new inputs.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:26.170
AUDIENCE: And that one is
on the last block, as well.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.627
But I'd have to go
back [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:28.627 --> 00:24:30.460
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so the question is,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.600
does the last block--

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.190
Bitcoin has 550-some 1,000
blocks of data right now.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.040
Does the last block
store all of the data?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.710
And the answer is, no, but
it does store a hash function

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.160
from the previous block,
which stores a hash function

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.100
from the previous block.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.450
So your transaction output might
be on block number 420,000,

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.760
130,000 blocks ago.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.430
But what shows that
it's verifiable

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.480
is that each one of these blocks
are linked to another block

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.460
through this thing called
a commitment scheme

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.790
called a hash function.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:17.120
So technically speaking,
the latest block

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.870
has a number in it--

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.750
a hexadecimal number,
but a number in it--

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.660
called a hash function
that is committed to.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.870
Because all the data
that's come before it--

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.770
all the millions of
transactions before it--

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.060
if somebody even
changes one of them,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.672
you'll know that
it's been tampered.

00:25:37.672 --> 00:25:41.460
AUDIENCE: Let's say I want
to use that balance I have.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.500
Where do the blockchain
verify that I have that?

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.180
Is it on the last
block, or does it

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.495
go back as long as it
finds the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:53.495 --> 00:25:54.870
GARY GENSLER: In
essence, it does

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.420
both, because the last
block better be valid.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.450
But for you to
spend something, it

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:10.180
has to really go back and find
that the input that you now

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:15.420
want to use is an output
that has not yet been spent.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.570
Eric, did you have something
that you were trying to--

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was
a very nice explanation.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.780
You have to go all the way
where your transaction-- where

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.365
you got the Bitcoin
was, whatever

00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:32.225
block it is [INAUDIBLE]
through the blockchain.

00:26:32.225 --> 00:26:35.470
If you would try
to get those coins

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:41.160
and use them as a [INAUDIBLE]
for whatever transaction

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.045
you want to do, you have
to go all the way back.

00:26:44.045 --> 00:26:45.420
GARY GENSLER: And
this complexity

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.310
is part of the
reason why it doesn't

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.110
have the same performance--

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.130
doesn't have the same
scalability-- yet.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.550
I'm one that believes in a--

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.100
I'm optimistic that some
of these scalability

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.230
and performance issues
will be overcome.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.050
But it might take three,
five, seven years.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.513
And it's not three
or seven months.

00:27:07.513 --> 00:27:09.180
But you're absolutely
right, because you

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.210
have to kind of look back--

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.240
way back.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.860
The Ethereum network doesn't
just do it on transactions.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.838
It has balances.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.880
And so it's a little bit
more efficient that way,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.650
and has other inefficiencies--

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:30.450
many other big inefficiencies,
but in some ways it--

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.100
We talked about smart contracts.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.360
Larry Lessig actually spoke to
us also about smart contracts.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.970
Nick Szabo wrote
about this in 1996.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.980
I like to talk about
the history to say,

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.670
it's not all about this one
person that we don't know--

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.460
Satoshi Nakamoto--
but a set of promises

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.550
specified in digital form,
including protocols, where

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.380
parties keep their promises.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.170
Think about it as a
modern way to automate.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.375
So if you're out in
business in the future,

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.250
you're thinking about
investing, and somebody

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.700
raises a smart contract issue.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.447
Even if you're a
Bitcoin minimalist,

00:28:05.447 --> 00:28:06.780
you might say, wait, wait, wait.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.000
There might be some
way I can automate

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.570
that which is currently
done by lawyers,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.375
or by back-office
folks, or accountants.

00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:18.750
So there's still
something there.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.420
And we talked about a
use case where the SDA--

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.260
the Swap Derivatives
Association--

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.270
is looking at smart
contracts to try

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:34.970
to automate some of the
previously written mechanisms.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.590
So smart contracts,
which have come out

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.480
of this whole blockchain
technology movement,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.083
actually predates
blockchain technology.

00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:48.250
But blockchain technology,
again, as well-- maybe we

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:53.780
can do this in a verifiable,
nearly immutable way, as well.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.800
So moving value or
automating some forms

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.070
of contractual arrangement.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.950
But remember,
they're not so smart,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.670
and they're not
so much contracts.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.510
You probably still
need the courts,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.490
and there's still some
ambiguity that can't

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.790
be pushed into these documents.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.710
So then, we talked a
lot about the economics

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.630
of blockchain technology.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.040
And it's around verification
costs and networking costs.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.350
But it's about lowering
verification costs.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.910
And some of those
verification costs

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.060
might just be the economic
rents of the current incumbents.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.230
So blockchain technology may
be a really important way

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.630
to lower direct verification
costs and deal with censorship.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.810
And I think that was a lot of
what Nakamoto's innovation was

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.850
about, was dealing with
censorship that somebody

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.400
could deny me the right
to use my money when

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.410
I want to use my money.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.810
But it could also be about
lowering economic rents.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.142
Any questions?

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.580
And then we said, how do
you assess a use case?

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.080
And this was at the core of
even my CoinDesk article.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.500
Before you get to anything
else is, how is it going to be,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.150
really?

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.140
It's what's the value
creation proposition?

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.900
Again, what are the verification
and networking costs that

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.710
are really going to be reduced?

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.650
And what are competitors doing?

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.420
With a keen eye on--

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.810
in trade finance,
there's 20 or 30 efforts,

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.390
so it's worthwhile
looking at those 20 or 30.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.360
I don't know which
field you all go into,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.940
but if you're in a field where
nobody has used blockchain

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.910
technology, no competitor,
then ask the question,

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:40.290
well, how are competitors
using traditional databases?

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.340
And that might be the
opportunity for you.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.350
And it might be a
golden opportunity.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.660
But always look-- what's
the value proposition?

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.760
What verification
and networking cost?

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.260
What's the competition?

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:58.273
And then, you get into
the sort of tough details.

00:30:58.273 --> 00:30:59.690
And if you're
investing, if you're

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.400
a venture capitalist
and somebody

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.210
can't really tell you why
multiple stakeholders need

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.870
to write to the ledger,
and what's their data--

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.780
what data are they going to
be storing on this append-only

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.380
log--

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.520
then I might suggest you
invest in something else.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.270
I mean, you can always
invest in something

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.720
because you think that
it's a momentum play.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.140
And if you invest, it's
an early seed investment,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.108
and somebody will bail you out.

00:31:28.108 --> 00:31:29.650
But most venture
capitalists-- you're

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.380
investing for three to six
years, or three to five years.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.350
And so I wouldn't
always expect somebody

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.220
is going to bail you out.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.590
Ask the tough questions.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.382
Jihee?

00:31:39.382 --> 00:31:41.590
AUDIENCE: But just because
that is the best solution,

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.220
it doesn't mean that they're
going to be successful later,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.030
right?

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.280
There are multiple examples
of products, or services,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.830
or [INAUDIBLE] that are
clearly not the best solution

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.760
but have taken dominant
position in a market.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.610
So I was curious, should
it be the best solution?

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.710
GARY GENSLER: Well, I think
that's one of the questions.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.605
But you're saying, well, what
if it's not the best solution?

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.140
Going back to what
Jeff Sprecher said,

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:23.050
can it do something
cheaper, faster, or better?

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.468
And it might not be
the best solution.

00:32:25.468 --> 00:32:27.260
But if it can at least
answer the question,

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.310
is it cheaper,
better, or faster,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.380
you're probably not
going to be successful.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.070
And in some cases, it's
not the best data solution,

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.380
but there's such
high economic rents

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.980
that however the mortgage
product, the health care

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.230
product, the product that
is being delivered now,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.080
the payment solution
that you're saying, ah,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.290
it's not the best solution.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.910
But this is my solution on how
I'm going to do it cheaper,

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.000
because they have so
many economic rents.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.760
So maybe that the
word should say,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.900
why is this a better solution,
rather than best solution.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.294
I'll agree with that.

00:33:06.294 --> 00:33:07.890
Other queries?

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.550
And then, if there's
a native token,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.490
I think that's where
you start to lose May.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.850
But now, I'm going
to ask the class.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.030
How many people have come
out of this semester thinking

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.450
there's a lot of
initial coin offerings

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.978
that you'd want to
personally invest in?

00:33:29.978 --> 00:33:31.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.590
All right, is there
anybody in the class

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:38.340
that owns an initial coin
offering-- a non-Bitcoin token?

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.741
OK, do you want to tell us why?

00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:44.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.830
GARY GENSLER: Give us the value
proposition, or the pitch.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.710
AUDIENCE: So I went to work
for a startup, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.780
this summer.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.050
And after the summer,
they paid me US dollars.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.930
But after the summer, they gave
me a lot of tokens they have.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.520
And I saved a
little bit of them.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.380
So you got paid in tokens.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.030
AUDIENCE: No, I was
paid in US dollars.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.400
After the summer, they
gave me most of the--

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.030
like a bunch of--
some of the tokens.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.409
GARY GENSLER: As a bonus or?

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.040
AUDIENCE: As a bonus, yeah.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.360
GARY GENSLER: I see.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.659
As a bonus, you got--

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:20.170
all right.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.610
And you sold some of them?

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:23.260
AUDIENCE: Some of
them, sold them.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.429
GARY GENSLER: And I see.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.270
AUDIENCE: Some of them
I still [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.270
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:32.300
And do you think that there's
a use for these native tokens?

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.726
AUDIENCE: This specific startup?

00:34:33.726 --> 00:34:34.704
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:35.980
Names will not be repeated.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.912
It's being filmed.

00:34:36.912 --> 00:34:37.870
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:38.995
GARY GENSLER: I don't know.

00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:39.760
Sean.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.739
AUDIENCE: So I
thought of it-- well,

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.520
I just thought a little
of like Tron, which is a--

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.159
GARY GENSLER: Tron.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.409
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's a gaming.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.820
GARY GENSLER: Gaming site.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.850
AUDIENCE: Which is a--
basically a company

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.460
started by a friend of mine.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.980
So it's kind of a
token of support

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.219
instead of like [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.219
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.020
So you bought some tokens
as a token of support

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.630
for a friend, who
started a company.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.330
Do you think they have some use?

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.740
Can you use the token?

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.778
AUDIENCE: I don't
think there's-- well--

00:35:07.778 --> 00:35:09.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.800
Well, it's supposed to be the--

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.885
building up to the biggest
gaming network [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:16.510
GARY GENSLER: But is
it pre-functional,

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.205
or is it functional?

00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:19.790
It's pre-functional.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:20.680
Hugo?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.575
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:21.575 --> 00:35:22.950
GARY GENSLER: You
have-- you are?

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.330
AUDIENCE: I have-- yeah.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.330
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.247
You don't-- all right.

00:35:26.247 --> 00:35:27.520
He's got a whole portfolio.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.842
I can tell.

00:35:28.842 --> 00:35:29.800
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.862
I've been interested in
this for over a year now.

00:35:32.862 --> 00:35:34.320
So I wanted to make
a whole radical

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.612
of like, oh, this one looks
like it's going to go well,

00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:37.680
but this one's a scam.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:44.810
And there are some that seem
like sure-- in the long run,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.760
they may retain some value.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.967
But I probably made
some bad investments.

00:35:49.967 --> 00:35:50.800
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.340
So I don't want to make you sort
of grieve those bad investment

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.820
decisions, but are any of
your tokens that you have held

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.990
or hold currently-- are
any of them functional?

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.530
Like, they can be
used on a network?

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.405
And I actually use
at least one of them.

00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:08.830
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.758
Here.

00:36:10.758 --> 00:36:12.550
Are you an owner, or
you've got a question?

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.020
AUDIENCE: I'm an
owner, but not--

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.510
I haven't voted.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.410
Both the tokens-- I'm
mining the tokens.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:22.430
But in any case, I
wouldn't disregard maybe

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:27.860
tokens that's a valid way of
generating a means to jumpstart

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:34.840
a network and create
some sort of valid way

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:41.270
to drive collective action for
some disintermediation effort,

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.230
because I mean I--

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.820
and I think it's a
little bit unfair

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.920
to ask if we kind of
join or support ICOs

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.397
in the context of there's
huge amount of scams

00:36:54.397 --> 00:36:56.230
that are [INAUDIBLE]
right now in the media.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.037
But I wouldn't disregard the
whole concept of tokens here.

00:37:00.037 --> 00:37:01.120
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.370
I admit it might have
been an unfair question.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.720
I was just trying to get--

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.740
I was just trying to get some
support in the room for tokens.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.550
AUDIENCE: The concept for
me is absolutely valid.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.310
I would explore,
seriously explore--

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.850
if I launch a startup
in the blockchain space,

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.890
seriously explore
the possibility

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:25.030
of using maybe tokens in the
permissionless environment.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.500
So I suppose the permission--

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.720
GARY GENSLER: So I think
that there is definitely

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.830
a future in this overall
technology of making

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:42.820
a database harder
to tamper with,

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.460
more immutable on
a scale, maybe not

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.830
100% immutable, but
closer to that immutable

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.580
and inverifiable.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.060
I think that native tokens
could help jump start a network.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.740
What I think the challenge
is I think the challenge is,

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.490
how do you compete
with fiat currency

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:07.110
that has such extraordinary
network effects?

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.790
So the Ernst & Young study,
the recent study, I think

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.870
captures this a bit when they
looked at the 140 largest ICOs

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.030
from 2017.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.390
Only about I think
it was 17 of 140

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.850
have a functioning
network right now,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.330
where you can use
the token, 13%.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:30.110
But of those 17, I
think seven of them,

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.360
the networks that are
live, instead of, well,

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.720
guess what, we'll also take
fiat currency for this service

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.850
that we're providing,
whether they're providing

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.600
file storage or something else.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.570
So they definitely
used a native token

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:45.050
to jumpstart the network
as a crowdfunding,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.550
but then when they got to
the later functional stage,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.710
the operator, the
entrepreneur says,

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.740
I don't want to limit my users.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.260
I'm going to also take fiat
currency to buy or secure

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.720
whatever service I'm having.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.840
And I think that's the
business model challenge.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.110
And it may well be that
there are networks,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.890
just like in gaming sites,
where you want skins or shields,

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.430
and there's something about
only trading those tokens.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.250
But to date, that's
been a limited class.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.680
That's where I probably
will declare myself.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.860
I think, of course, there's
a bunch of tradeoffs

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.110
over the next three
to seven years

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:38.350
that will be sorted out around
performance, privacy, security.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.970
We talked about layer 2.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.230
If any of you are actually
interested in work

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.090
in the blockchain
technology field,

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.670
you're going to learn a
lot about layer 2 solutions

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.630
and side chains and all the
performance scalability things

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.420
that colleagues over at the
Digital Currency Initiative

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.010
are spending a lot of time
on this question right here.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.620
And then, of course,
this is a business model.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.502
Just purely as a
venture capitalist,

00:40:03.502 --> 00:40:05.460
you have to think about,
how do I get adoption?

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.770
How do-- what's my
customer user interface?

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.920
I'm sure, Iman, you're thinking
a lot about this, right?

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.860
You could have the best
idea on a data structure.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.460
You could have a really
nifty idea on a native token.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.590
But you still have
to deal with whatever

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:24.270
venture capitalist has to do is,
how do I get users to use this?

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.900
Adoption.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.120
What's my UI?

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.310
And it's sort of a much
more generic set of issues.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.810
Iman.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.980
AUDIENCE: That was
my answer to Jihee.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.900
She's totally right.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.380
It's all about-- it's a tension
between adoption and quality

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.640
of product.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.188
And that's why we
moved from Ethereum

00:40:48.188 --> 00:40:49.230
to the public blockchain.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.710
But we didn't think that
it will be mass adopt by--

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.550
massively adopted
by the incumbents.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.580
So we moved to a
permission blockchain

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.585
because of the adoption.

00:41:01.585 --> 00:41:03.960
GARY GENSLER: And I can't
remember if you're able to say.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.430
Which are you using--

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.040
Hyperledger Fabric or Corda or?

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.750
AUDIENCE: We're using Corda
because of the state channels

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.110
solution that they provide.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.260
GARY GENSLER: So we
talked about frameworks.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.430
Over time, it's my thought that
that orange line, the slope

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.560
of that will come down,
and we'll move more

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.900
towards the decentralized side.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.100
But for the orange line, the
slope to come down, in essence,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.540
the costs of the scalability,
security, even the coordination

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.740
needs to come down.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.920
It's always going to be some
challenge on governance.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.490
In essence, who is going
to pay for the software

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:47.170
development in a truly
decentralized network?

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:52.900
And Bitcoin has been supported,
for instance, by, really,

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.200
an incredible group of
Bitcoin Core developers,

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.390
in part because
they just believe

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.520
in it, in part that
some are funded

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.530
by institutions like MIT.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.720
But it's still-- it's always
a challenge in a truly

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.310
decentralized space.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.570
Who's going to fund--

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:14.680
who's got the economic interest
to fund the continued updates

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.850
and software?

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:21.280
I think Uber could be completely
a decentralized network.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.210
And probably, drivers
would get paid more.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.490
But then where would
be the incentive?

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.710
Who would work on the
software development

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.420
to update their ride app?

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.310
So there's a key tradeoff there.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.340
The financial sector--
well, it moves and allocates

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.510
money and risk.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.890
We talked about that.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.170
But it relies on a
system of ledgers,

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:50.390
and it's always had a symbiotic
relationship with technology.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.450
The opportunities-- these
are the key opportunities,

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.460
which I think any
thought fintech--

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.060
it's not just blockchain but
even AI and machine learning--

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.370
has around finances.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.900
The customer
interfaces-- there's

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.850
a lot of legacy
customer interfaces

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.410
that you can actually
compete with,

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.150
if you're doing a startup.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.750
The economic rents are high.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.730
There's 7 and 1/2 percent
of the economy is finance.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.340
Not all of the 7 and
1/2 percent is rents,

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.470
but there is a lot of extra--

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.220
excuse the expression-- a
lot of extra vig or juice

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:26.330
in that model.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.300
And, of course, we've
had repeated crises

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.260
and instability.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.800
And financial inclusion--
we talked about products

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.980
like Alipay and M-Pesa
that were really

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.430
about financial inclusion
using new technologies.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.940
So what are the
technologies in our time?

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.840
I just put up a nice
little graphic here.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.790
I'm doing some work
with a group called

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.810
FinTech at CSAIL, the Computer
Science and AI Lab here.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.180
And when we leave with
the funding companies,

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.780
the big funding companies
of that unit over there,

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.635
blockchain is on their list,
but it's not number one.

00:44:03.635 --> 00:44:06.625
To just put it in context, in
terms of their technologies,

00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:08.250
they're thinking
about machine learning

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:12.270
and AI would probably
be the biggest piece.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.300
But just to give a flavor for--

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.990
but it's one of the
top three or four.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.050
But as we've talked about,
they have challenges.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.040
The financial sector
sees a lot of challenges.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.540
AUDIENCE: I just want to
go back to previous slides,

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.930
and how would the virtual
reality impact finance?

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.660
I'm not sure.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.160
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.535
GARY GENSLER: That
has happened--

00:44:34.535 --> 00:44:36.650
AUDIENCE: AR and VR,
[INAUDIBLE] tech, finance.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.150
GARY GENSLER: I'm not
familiar with the projects

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.890
in that space.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.403
But where-- and I'm
sure I'm getting now,

00:44:48.403 --> 00:44:50.320
you're going to inspire
me to do some research

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.770
in the next day or two to shoot
your email with some projects.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:45:01.090
But virtual reality
and hearing it does

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.340
allow for more
financial inclusion.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.750
And the question really
is, can you just, rather--

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.460
think of the user experience.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:17.530
If you can find an enjoyable
way to spend more money

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.530
through virtual reality,
the banking system

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.900
wants to tap into that.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.010
It's not one of the top
things at FinTech at CSAIL,

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.060
I'd say AI, machine learning,
biometrics, and blockchain.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.800
Everything's in the
cloud, so they're not

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.030
asking, right now, MIT to
help them with cloud issues.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.120
Open API is a really big
issue, particularly in London

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.900
and in the UK, where it's been
regulated that the banks need

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.910
to use Open API.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.090
So I'd say AR and
virtual reality

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:53.110
is probably eighth
on the list there.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.050
And I just include it,
because I kind of think it's--

00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:00.190
they'll find a way to
change a user interface.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.950
We talked about there's
a bunch of issues,

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.830
and that's really
leading to the use.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.560
We talked about traditional
databases, which--

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.220
where parties can just
create, read, write,

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.650
the ledger, the private
blockchain, which,

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:21.220
of course, is what most of
trade finance, most of payments,

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.470
all the big central banks
that have looked at it

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:27.300
or moved from Ethereum to
doing Hyperledger projects--

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.490
Singapore and Canada's Jasper--

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.650
and maybe permissionless.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:39.300
But the finance is really in
the second bucket right now.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.480
Eric, it's not to say that
native tokens won't take off

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.300
and, Hugo, that your portfolio
will be worth something, maybe.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.550
So here, we went through
a bunch of use cases.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.750
But the biggest use case so far
has been the $20 to $30 billion

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.830
that's been raised through ICOs.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:06.950
I personally think that's
going to come down, way down.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.410
But payment systems--

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:14.700
I mean we might differ on
the views of XRP, a token,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.680
but Ripple and
other companies have

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.220
done a lot to try to be a
catalyst for change and payment

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.250
systems.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:22.950
We talked a lot
about trade finance.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.720
Again, they're more
in the permissions

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.980
than the permissionless.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.990
Clearing and settling--
what's going on in Australia.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.970
Again, permissionless, not--
I mean permissioned, not

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.910
permissionless.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:43.240
And then some of
the non-financial--

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.290
had a lively discussion about
supply chain management,

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:51.160
and James, I'll forever remember
that you're not a fan of it.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.330
But Walmart and Cargo
might disagree with James.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.480
And they have active
projects on it.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.160
And Lauren gave--
where's Lauren?

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.790
She's here, maybe--
gave a reason why

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.490
in supply chain
sustainability that you

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.080
might be on the other side.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:14.180
Digital ID was the last
thing we talked about.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.890
So there's a lot going on, and
when there's $20 or $30 billion

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.930
raised, there's going
to be-- these projects

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.620
will have some life to them.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:26.410
We'll learn a lot from
them along the way.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.720
Crypto finance-- when I
first put this slide up,

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.350
it wasn't $110 billion.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.590
And gosh knows I
did this yesterday,

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.350
so I don't even know
what it is today.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.790
Pretty volatile market.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:41.480
Interestingly, Bitcoin staggered
about 55% or 57% of the market.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:48.450
So there's a high correlation,
though Ethereum slid, and XRP

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:54.510
is number two in that market
since we first got together

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.640
in September.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.290
Here, what I think the
challenge is, as an investor--

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.840
I'm not trying to pick on
you, Hugo, but you know,

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.160
an investor.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.770
But I think that's the
number one challenge.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.500
I really do.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.430
What's the viability
of that token?

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.680
And Eric, I'll agree with you.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.120
Some tokens will
be worth something.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.700
But it's assessing that.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.940
But the markets are readily
susceptible to fraud.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.160
How do I keep custody
for the private key?

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.880
Fidelity has announced
they're going

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.000
to have a new
private key solution,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.940
so it's interesting that big
incumbents are coming in.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:34.490
It's not just the Zappos and the
early stage custody solutions.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.330
Even Backed, the
Intercontinental Exchange,

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:39.830
has put a lot of money into it.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.380
And they'll, in essence,
have a custody solution,

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.590
because you could buy
Bitcoin, one day futures,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:47.960
have a Bitcoin, and then
they would, in essence,

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.210
hold custody for you.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.950
And then we talked
about crypto exchanges.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.760
And the key thing-- and
if you take anything away

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.460
about exchanges, other than
right now they're unregulated

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.520
and they're probably highly
susceptible to front running

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.880
and manipulation, is that
they're a little bit different,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.130
because they're
not just matching

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:12.370
agents, which the London Stock
Exchange or the New York Stock

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.430
Exchange are [INAUDIBLE],, but
they also are counterparties

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:16.510
and custodians.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:22.750
The other thing to take
away about crypto exchanges

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.430
is they're highly centralized.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.330
So it's a central irony that
Satoshi Nakamoto is trying

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.190
to have decentralization,
and yet there's

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.090
an awful lot of centralization.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.580
So I'm just thinking
about core takeaways.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.980
If you're ever investing, or
you're thinking about this,

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.560
or you're just involved in
a dinner party conversation,

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.620
that central irony in
a decentralized space,

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:51.530
95% of the real transactions are
happening on crypto exchanges.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.130
My thought about
crypto exchanges--

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:59.990
they'll not be 200 of them
that much longer either.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.060
We talked about
Initial Coin Offerings.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.670
Central takeaway is they're
fundraising vehicles.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.430
Whether you believe
in or not believe

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:11.420
in the US and Canadian
approach under the Howey Test,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.760
but they help build a network,
raise money in anticipation

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.985
the tokens are issued
before it's functional.

00:51:19.985 --> 00:51:24.110
I think the latest
study was that--

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.570
what was it-- 1 and 1/2 percent
are actually functional,

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.210
and 98 and 1/2 percent
are issued pre-functional.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.550
So that's not a problem.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.610
It's just-- that's the--

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.830
means it's probably an
investment vehicle, not

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.270
a utility token.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.260
And that whole thing
about utility token

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.010
versus security tokens, it
stretched pretty darn thin.

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.680
We talked about public
policy frameworks,

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.200
guarding against illicit
activity, financial stability,

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.610
investing public.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.090
My overall thought on this--

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.210
and I accept that others
will have other views--

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:05.240
is that any new technology, if
it grows to be economy-wide,

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.630
needs to live within
public policy frameworks,

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.560
or society will change those
public policy frameworks

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.190
modestly.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.070
But you still want
to protect the public

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.790
against core social goods.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.590
It happened when the
railroad came along.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.230
It happened when telegram came
along in the 19th century.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:25.610
It happened with the internet.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.770
Societies don't
have technologies

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:33.870
fully outside of whatever
social fabric we want to create.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.850
And we do that
social fabric stuff

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:40.770
through politics and parliaments
and executives and regulators.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:45.490
But we don't leave big parts
of our economy outside of it.

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:47.545
This stuff is still small.

00:52:47.545 --> 00:52:49.240
It's $100 billion.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.240
The worldwide capital markets
are over $300 trillion.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.930
But it's gained a lot
of public attention.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.740
And particularly, we want to
guard against illicit activity.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.650
Most folks do.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:05.790
Maybe not everybody.

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:07.310
But most do.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.850
No, I recognize.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:09.990
Hopefully, you all do.

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.800
Well, I don't know.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.790
So we talked about the US
Securities Law, the Howey Test.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:21.090
It's not-- if you forget the
Howey Test, it's totally fine.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:24.570
But it's core to these
initial coin offerings,

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.490
and it was that four-part test--

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.500
investment of money in
a common enterprise,

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.030
expectation of profits.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.760
So if you get into
some debate, and you

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.330
want to have some
fun with somebody,

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.850
you can say you
know the Howey Test.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.390
But it's really more this.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.450
I prefer the Duck Test.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:44.280
Just use common sense.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.460
This course has been more
about critical reasoning skills

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.690
than anything.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.450
So if somebody's trying to sell
you something or hustle you

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.300
on something, and you are
now a venture capitalist,

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.870
and you're investing,
use the Duck Test.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.430
You can even remember
the Duck Test

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.770
about whether they're trying
to sell you something,

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.090
and it has nothing
to do with the law.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:11.010
It just-- so where do I think
crypto exchanges will go?

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:15.390
I think that they'll have to
fix this whole custodial duty

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.110
stuff.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.750
They might all use
Fidelity's product.

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:24.780
Or they'll keep it
in-house or spin it off.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.790
I think they'll have to start
complying with any money

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:28.290
laundering.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.890
We saw one study that said
a quarter of all exchanges

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:34.530
don't even have any AML.

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:38.970
I think two years from
now, that will be way down.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:42.150
I think margins
will compress, and I

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.980
don't think there'll
be 200 exchanges

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.840
two or three years from now.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.570
There'll be five or
10 relevant exchanges

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.360
at some point in time.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.942
On Initial Coin
Offerings, I think

00:54:52.942 --> 00:54:54.900
we're going to keep seeing
a high failure rate.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.150
There's still about 200 a
month, but there'll probably

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.730
be fewer of them.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.180
I think that there's going to
be a lot of enforcement actions.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.860
Occasionally, you'll
see something--

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.430
the Securities and Exchange
Commission or some other--

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.240
maybe it will be in
Japan or elsewhere will

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.310
be bringing more cases.

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.670
And what will be interesting
in 2019 is to watch,

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.580
does any of the
big ones go live?

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.740
And I think this
will be a real test.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.990
Does Filecoin figure
out what to do?

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.690
They raised a quarter
of a billion dollars.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:29.420
Telegram raised $1.7 billion.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.430
Do they figure out
what to do and make

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.040
a real live effort in 2019?

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.140
And it will test the economics.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.060
And by the way, Eric,
it might pull me more

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.640
towards where you are, right?

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.610
I mean Telegram's-- they got a
lot of smart folks over there

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.320
working on this.

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.820
And by the way, Facebook
has advertisements out

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.380
hiring people on
blockchain technology.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.280
So there's a lot of very
big tech companies hiring

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.060
and recruiting in this space.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.930
But I think 2019 will be
interesting to see, what does--

00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:58.680
what is Telegram?

00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.580
What is Filecoin?

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:03.000
What do some of the big,
hopefully, well-meaning

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.990
companies do with these tokens?

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:10.650
Central banks-- mostly
in the monitor phase.

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:12.948
But I'd say the thing
to watch is Sweden.

00:56:12.948 --> 00:56:14.490
It'll be really
interesting what they

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.370
do with their E-krona project.

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:20.610
Do they go live and say,
inspired by blockchain?

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.490
The E-krona project is
not blockchain technology,

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:27.930
but it's completely inspired by
Satoshi Nakamoto saying, well,

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:33.000
we, the central bank, Jihee's
the central bank says,

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.240
we're going to do what
Satoshi Nakamoto's--

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.630
we're going to have a
central bank digital token.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.140
You can use it at Starbucks.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.630
You can use it wherever.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:43.410
I'd watch that.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:47.690
I think Venezuela will
probably fail on the other end.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:48.780
But it'll be interesting.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:54.720
There might be some distressed
country that does something.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.310
So how would I conclude?

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.680
I think blockchain does--

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.110
this is my disclosure.

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:04.560
I think it does provide a
real peer-to-peer alternative.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.640
I think it's a legit
live application.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.860
It might not be the best, but
is it better than some others?

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.550
Is it something you could use?

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.676
Verification and
networking cost--

00:57:16.676 --> 00:57:19.110
I'm going to repeat on that--

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.330
is the key.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.520
But you always, I think,
have to assess, is it

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.930
the right use case?

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.013
Is this use case
the right use case?

00:57:28.013 --> 00:57:29.430
But as we've talked,
I think there

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.940
are real use cases
more in permissioned

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.510
than permissionless.

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.110
Remember anything.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.790
Money is just-- we all
humans, the 7 billion

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:45.730
of us that live now,
have to thank somebody

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.020
about 10,000 years ago, but came
up with this technology called

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.370
money.

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:53.560
Store value, medium
of exchange, unit

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.870
of account-- it's just a
social construct, which

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:58.480
is a reason why I say, we
could have a social construct

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.380
that is decentralized money.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.330
I absolutely believe
we could have that.

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.130
But we'd all have to accept it.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.160
Where I have less
optimism is that you'd

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.360
want to accept it for a
closed, bounded ecosystem

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.340
only for file storage.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.430
That's where I'm a
little challenged as to,

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:23.930
what is the real
economics of that?

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.820
Financial sector's
characteristics

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.560
and challenges--

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.080
is it good?

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.530
It's fertile ground, because
finance is built on ledgers.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:35.090
And finance is big--

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:38.440
7 and 1/2 percent
of our economy.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.210
And around the globe,
it's anywhere from 5%

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.420
to probably 8% of
those economies.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.510
Most other countries,
it's less than the US,

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.190
but it's still-- it's big.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.690
Incumbents are,
of course, looking

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.970
at permissioned blockchains.

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:54.740
And unfortunately,
crypto finance

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.800
has a bunch of scams and frauds.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.860
And that hurts the development.

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.730
But I think adoption
will come, but it

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.070
rests on solving a bunch
of technical issues,

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:11.800
like the Digital Currency
Initiative's trying to solve.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.560
What are the commercial use
cases and the public policy?

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.110
I wouldn't lead
with public policy.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.380
I don't think that's
the main issue here.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.200
But if this is ever
going to be anything,

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.400
it's got to get over that.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.920
So mostly, it's probably going
to be a catalyst for change,

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.710
more than actual real thoughts.

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:32.722
Questions?

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.620
Thoughts?

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.185
Eric.

00:59:38.185 --> 00:59:41.653
AUDIENCE: On the
third point, I--

00:59:41.653 --> 00:59:43.320
GARY GENSLER: Use
cases must address why

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.060
versus a traditional database.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.530
AUDIENCE: I always
had the feeling

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.470
that it seemed the
permissioned space, where

00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:54.190
you have the most or the
biggest urge to prove where--

00:59:54.190 --> 01:00:00.630
if your submission needs a
blockchain solution as opposed

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.925
to a traditional--

01:00:01.925 --> 01:00:05.040
I mean making a case against
the centralized database

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.755
is kind of easy, versus
a distributed database.

01:00:08.755 --> 01:00:11.210
I think it's a little bit tough.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.987
But in the
permissionless space, I

01:00:13.987 --> 01:00:15.570
think you don't have
to struggle much,

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.810
because it's absolutely
justified that you can--

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:23.010
because you're dealing with a
decentralized configuration,

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:27.900
where there's no one in
charge of guaranteeing

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.020
that we have a--

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.310
GARY GENSLER: So Eric's
raising the question,

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:34.480
why not use a
traditional database?

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.120
Why ever use a permissioned--

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.620
AUDIENCE: In the
permissioned space,

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.080
because permissionless
is perfectly justified.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.550
But in the
permissioned space, I'm

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.500
not saying it's not justified.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.840
The point is being
that in our project,

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.810
we argued for a
permissioned system.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.910
We made some justifications
in that space,

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:59.970
so the point is that I just
wanted to get your thoughts so

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.760
that in the
permissionless spaces,

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.140
you don't have to
struggle much in that.

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.800
GARY GENSLER: Permissionless
blockchain technology,

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.480
looking forward a
number of years,

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.570
looking forward to when some of
the scalability and performance

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:17.540
gets better, can give
you verification costs.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.720
And it's censorship-resistant
or practically

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.010
censorship-resistant, unless
somebody does a 51% attack.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:31.120
But so I think that the truly
decentralized distributed

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.480
permissionless system has
a lot of-- a lot to offer.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.710
But it comes with a lot of
costs, too, and challenges--

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:44.240
hard to do the governance and
hard to get coordinated action.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.700
And as you've heard
me say, I think

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.400
there's only probably going
to be a very limited use

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:56.400
cases for native tokens,
native product-specific tokens

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:03.690
like a Filecoin or a restaurant
review coin or a health care

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:04.740
coin.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:08.070
I have-- I have my
doubts about that.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:11.820
An economy-wide coin, a
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin--

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.190
I think there's more
use, particularly

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.520
if you have a weak central
bank, a weak fiscal policy.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.620
A country like Venezuela in the
future might adopt something.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.840
I think there's a lot to
be said for permissionless,

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.590
but permissioned systems versus
traditional databases, I think,

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.180
also gives something.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.150
And I'll use the Australian
stock exchange for one,

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.950
but they know their customers.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.910
They know they have--

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:38.640
I think the number
was 77 members.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.510
They can take their database
and decentralize it and put it

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:47.730
on all 77 member companies,
if that's the right number,

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:51.180
and say, you're
now sharing that.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.610
And so then there's no
single point of failure,

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.370
and we can lower what's
called reconciliation costs,

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.370
because you all needed
some of that data anyway.

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:04.620
The historic data-keeping,
the historic nature of it

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.230
came up with each
of those 77 members

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.370
having individual databases.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:12.540
So I could see that there is
a real benefit in probably

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.810
efficiency and
lowering costs, which

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:18.650
means lowering costs
of verification,

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.400
lowering networking
costs, because there's

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.250
77 members, trade finance.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.030
I could see some
of that as well.

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.240
So that-- but you
might be right.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.920
Oracle might be
able to just adopt

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.290
that in a traditional database.

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:30.865
Sabrina.

01:03:30.865 --> 01:03:32.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
it seems like you're

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.800
describing that they have some
form of distributed consensus.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.390
And that's the
main reason, right?

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:38.836
But there's--

01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:40.890
GARY GENSLER: And
distributed the data

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.980
stored on multiple nodes,
because it's multiple copies

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.040
of the same data.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.580
AUDIENCE: Right, but yeah.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.690
There's-- I mean if that still
can be implemented without

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:51.770
watching.

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.456
I'm playing the Aleem
today, since he's not here.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:55.517
But there's no--

01:03:55.517 --> 01:03:56.600
GARY GENSLER: No, but we--

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.670
AUDIENCE: That's been a long
solved problem of how consensus

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.360
algorithms that--
or you can replicate

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.380
state on the same state
on both the machines

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.490
and tolerate some [INAUDIBLE]
number of failures.

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:14.470
So I personally don't really
see the use of blockchain

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:18.990
in permissioned systems, but
I do see a lot of potential

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.780
for permissionless systems,
just because those algorithms

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.540
already exist out there
to do [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.550
GARY GENSLER: So what
Sabrina's raising--

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.410
you can take the Sabrina seat.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:34.060
You're-- Sabrina's a master's
student at computer science

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.160
at MIT, so she probably knows
what she's talking about--

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.910
is really saying, well,
you can do a lot of that.

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:44.640
You can have
distributed databases

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.250
without blockchain technology.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.380
You can have-- and
there's ways that

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.380
this Byzantine-fought
tolerance has been addressed

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.860
in distributed
databases that you don't

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:57.510
need blockchain technology.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:02.055
The concept of a block,
commitment hash, block,

01:05:02.055 --> 01:05:06.100
a commitment hash,
block technology.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.240
And I accept that.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.890
But I'm not going
to accept it to say

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.830
that there's no space for
permissioned blockchain

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.510
technology.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.880
What there is space
for is the 80 of you

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.760
in this room to have different
opinions on all of this.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.765
You want to close out?

01:05:22.765 --> 01:05:24.640
I want to-- I have one
more slide I want to--

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.628
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:28.670
GARY GENSLER: So this is,
of course, about money,

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:31.760
so I went back and found a
quote from Benjamin Franklin

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.750
that I like.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:36.320
And to me, it's about a concept
that I hope you all live by.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.920
It's paying it forward.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.520
Paying forward is partly
because all of us in this room

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.360
are privileged.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:51.170
We're at MIT or Harvard or
Wellesley, but we're at MIT.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.970
And so what did
Ben Franklin say?

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.430
And it does close on money.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:57.260
"I do not pretend
to give such a deed.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.750
I only lend it to you.

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:02.540
When you meet another honest
man in similar distress,

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.980
you must pay me by
lending this sum to him

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.390
and joining him to discharge
the debt by a like operation,"

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:14.770
paying it forward, basically.

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.020
"He should be able and shall
meet another opportunity,

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.690
I hope, that this may,
though many hands."

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.910
So Benjamin Franklin,
over 200 years ago,

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.770
he closes, this
is a trick of mine

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:28.540
of doing a deal good
with a little money.

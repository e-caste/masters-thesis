00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.360
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.000
In this section, we want
to talk and investigate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.460
a bit more length contraction.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.470
We have seen length
contraction a few times

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.790
already in this class.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.410
We have derived it.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
We have seen it in application.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.470
But we want to get
some sort of feeling to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.900
how can we actually
understand what's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
happening to the objects.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.990
Later in this section,
in this video,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.140
we'll talk about another
paradox, spacecraft on a rope.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.550
So let's get to it.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.890
So the situation here is as we
have seen a few times already.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.650
We have Alice being
at rest, and Bob

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.720
is moving with a velocity v.
And what we are interested in

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.580
is this object here, which
might be a rod of some sort.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.220
You can think about a
spacecraft if you want,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.870
but a specific object, which,
at rest, has a length LB.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.170
For Alice, this object
is Lorentz contracted,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.870
and it appears shorter.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.110
So now what happens now if Bob
accelerates from his velocity v

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.380
to a velocity v plus delta
v with respect to Alice?

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.750
How does the acceleration occur?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.900
And how can we understand
then the further shrinking

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.460
of the spacecraft?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.090
Bob tries really, really
hard to accelerate such

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.870
that all elements of
this rod or spacecraft

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.670
are being accelerated
simultaneously

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.910
in his framework.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.010
You can think about
splitting up the spacecraft

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.240
into small elements.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.420
They're all getting a
little bit of a kick,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.870
a little bit of an extra
momentum at the very same time.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.520
So, if now Alice observes
the same situation,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.810
we find that she looks
at the spacecraft.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.570
And, because the leading
clock in the spacecraft,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.230
in Bob's spacecraft,
lags, she observes

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.060
that the spacecraft's back
is being accelerated first.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.930
And, because it's
accelerated first,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.390
she observes that the
spacecraft shrinks

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.678
just a little bit because
of the additional velocity.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.470
Well, that's kind of
an interesting picture

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.280
to think about how we can
understand length contraction

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.290
and how we can understand
length contraction

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.530
once there's
acceleration involved.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.890
OK, so the next question
now or the next topic

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.530
here in this video is the
spacecraft on a rope paradox.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.230
This was phrased by Bell
in the 1950s and '60s.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.260
He was working at CERN at the
time and roaming the corridors,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.460
discussing with his colleagues.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.250
The situation here is related
to the one we just discussed,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.280
but slightly different.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710
So let me explain.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.310
So again we have Alice
as an observer, observer

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.240
in a reference frame A,
observing two spacecrafts.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.830
They are identical spacecrafts.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.300
They have the same engines.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.540
And they are separated
by distance D.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.780
So now Alice gives a
signal to both spacecrafts

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.480
simultaneously in
her reference frame

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.930
to accelerate at
the same time such

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.100
that the distance between
B and C remains constant.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.220
So they're asked to accelerate
such that the distance remains

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.770
constant.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.330
Well, the question now is,
when those two spacecrafts

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.380
are connected with a rope,
will this rope break?

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.990
So I'll let you think
about this a bit

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.660
and come up with
your own answer.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.510
In the meantime, this is not
such a hard problem actually.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.870
In order to keep the
distance constant for A,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.330
the distance in the
BC reference frame,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.600
in the reference frame
of the two spacecrafts,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.280
needs to expand.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.420
So LA, so the distance as
observed by Alice or reference

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.149
frame A, is equal
to 1 over gamma,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.519
the distance between
the two [? planes. ?]

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.070
And for this to stay--
for LA to stay constant

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.280
while there's acceleration
going on, LBC needs to increase.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.080
That's why the rope will break.

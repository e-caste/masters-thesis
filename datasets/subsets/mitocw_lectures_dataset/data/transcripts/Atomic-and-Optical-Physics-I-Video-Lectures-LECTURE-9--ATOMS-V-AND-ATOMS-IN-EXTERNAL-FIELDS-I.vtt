00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.470
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.670
We want to wrap up today
our discussion of atoms

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.970
without external
field, and then discuss

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.850
what happens when we put atoms
into external magnetic fields.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.400
Last class, we talked
about isotope shifts,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.472
and there was a question, how
big are those isotopes for some

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.430
of your favorite atoms?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150
I just looked up
some information

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.330
on lithium, which
is a light atom,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
and this paper here
shows calculations

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.175
compared with experiments.

00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:16.050
The isotope shift between
lithium six and lithium seven

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.760
due to the mass, lithium
six to lithium seven,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.940
is about 10 gigahertz.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.360
The volume effect is only two
megahertz, 1,000 times smaller.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.170
However, the precision
of experiments

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.170
is such that if you
find an isotope shift,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.972
the mass effect can
be exactly calculated

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:36.350
from the atomic masses, you
can still get information

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.610
about the size of the
atomic nucleus out of it.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.360
So this is the example of a
light atom, 10 gigahertz mass

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
effect, two megahertz
volume effect.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.340
And here is a rubidium atom.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.080
The isotope shift of the
D1 line between 85 and 87

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.920
is 77 megahertz only.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.609
The mass shift is 56
megahertz, and the remainder

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.700
is mainly the volume effect.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.770
There's a specific mass effect
due to electronic correlations

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.800
if you calculate electrons,
which I think is small here

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.960
but I don't want to discuss it.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.170
We can now compare
the mass effect

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.300
in rubidium versus lithium.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.265
First of all, the shift
compared to infinite mass.

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:37.020
the reduced mass effect,
is much bigger in lithium.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.180
It's 20 times bigger in
lithium than in rubidium.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.400
However, when you go from
lithium six to lithium seven,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.850
the mass changes by 15%,
so the delta m over m

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.620
is also much larger for
lithium than rubidium.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.725
And if you add
those two factors,

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:57.285
you find that the mass
effect is 200 times larger

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:03.440
in lithium, 10 gigahertz
versus 50 megahertz.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.960
The nuclear volume
effect is two megahertz

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.830
for lithium, 20
megahertz for rubidium,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.660
so that sets the scale.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.680
Any questions about that?

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.970
Let me come back to one
other question which

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.130
we discussed last
class, and this

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.375
was the question
about if you have

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:45.300
a deformation of a
nucleus, or if you have

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.360
any kind of isotropic
shape of an object,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.906
what is the minimum
angular momentum in order

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:54.440
to observe it?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.220
I know a lot of you
got confused about it,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.890
so I want to discuss
the same thing again,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.772
but now focusing on two
different frames, the lab frame

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:09.310
and the body-fixed frame.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.410
I hope you find this
discussion insightful.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.828
So let's assume we have an
object, it can be a molecule.

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:45.018
Actually, you have a
homework assignment

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.770
whether you can observe
a permanent dipole

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.100
moment of a molecule,
and this will lead you

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.440
into a discussion of lab
frame versus body-fixed frame.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.850
But let's assume
we have an object,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.970
assume it's a nucleus, which
has a really odd shape.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.600
However, if it has
angular momentum of zero,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.950
all you have is one level.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.760
If you have an angular momentum
of 1/2, you have two levels,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.530
and you can now define
in the laboratory

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.830
that the energy difference
is due to the magnetic dipole

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.601
moment, for instance, or
the electric dipole moment

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:34.497
if you put in electric field.

00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:43.877
If you have I equals
1, you can have

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:52.215
three levels, E1, E0, E minus 1.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.240
Let's say you have put the
atoms into an electric field

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.520
gradient.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:09.430
You can then ask if E0 is in
the middle between up and down,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.270
plus 1 or minus 1, or whether
it's displaced or not.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.510
And depending whether this is
larger or smaller than zero,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.790
you would say there is a
quadrupole moment which

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.400
is larger or smaller than zero.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.220
In other words, what I'm telling
you is if you have only one

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.940
level, I equals 0,
you can't say anything

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.485
about the shape of the object.

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:38.090
If you have two levels, you
can determine a dipole moment.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.690
If you have three
levels, by the deviation

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.340
from the equidistance, you can
find a higher order moment.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.035
But now comes the point.

00:06:54.035 --> 00:06:55.670
You can now take two positions.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:09.680
You can say that for low I,
the deformation of a magnetic

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.920
moment for I equals
0 cannot be measured.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.230
Therefore, it is zero.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:46.880
Or you can say deformation
exists, but only not in the lab

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.104
frame but in the
body-fixed frame.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.410
So in other words, you would
say that the deformation exists

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.090
always.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.640
It's just a measurement problem.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.370
At low angular momentum,
I cannot measure.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.970
Or the other statement would be,
well, if you can't measure it,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.210
[INAUDIBLE], it means
it doesn't exist.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.847
So which statement or which
conclusion is correct?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.901
This is the body-fixed
frame argument,

00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:39.391
and this is more based
on the lab frame.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.090
Well, I would say the lab frame
argument is always correct

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.996
because you can't
measure it, you

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:54.730
can't determine it in the
lab, but let me go from there.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.430
Let's assume we have
an object, and we

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.614
think it has a deformation but
it has a low angular momentum

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:05.920
phase.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.395
Can we still say that
in its body-fixed frame,

00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:15.630
we have an object which
has a deformation or not?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:21.300
Now, my personal opinion
is the following.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.794
It really depends.

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:26.430
If you have a system
where you can have

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.000
angular momentum
without changing

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.530
the internal structure.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.865
For instance, I have this stick,
and I can just spin it up,

00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:37.740
and if I can spin it up, I can
get an angular momentum wave

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.840
packet, I can orient it and
measure its deformation.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.060
Then I think I would say, even
if this state has zero angular

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.230
momentum, it has a
deformation, and the way

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.110
I know it because if I
add angular momentum,

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.940
I can measure the deformation.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.570
I cannot measure it at
low angular momentum.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.970
So then you would say in
the body-fixed system,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.480
there is a deformation, but
it only manifests itself

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.980
in the lab frame if I
add angular momentum.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.450
However, you may have an
object, let's say a molecule,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.880
which is so weakly bound
that one quantum of angular

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.490
momentum due to centrifugal
forces rips it apart.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.670
That exists.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.560
Extremely bound state which
cannot provide enough binding

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.130
force to withstand even one
unit of angular momentum.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.000
So that's an object
which you cannot rotate,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.695
you cannot transfer any angular
momentum without destroying it,

00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:41.130
without ripping it apart.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.850
And now to say that this
molecule has a dipole moment

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.010
or has some anisotropy, you're
making a statement which cannot

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.210
be tested at all.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.374
So at that point, you
should rather say,

00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:56.290
what matters is what I
can measure in the lab,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.748
and I will never
be able to measure

00:10:57.748 --> 00:11:01.140
any deformation in the lab.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.560
So the first example
with the stick

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.170
will apply to a very
stable molecule which

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.844
may have a dipole
moment, and you

00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:13.885
assume it has the same
dipole moment whether it's

00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:15.450
rotating or not.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.160
And then you would say
at zero angular momentum,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.910
I cannot measure the dipole
moment but I know it exists

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.910
in the body-fixed frame.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.330
If you have a
nucleus, and you have

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.930
sort of a wave function of
the protons and neutrons,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.640
and it's I equals 0, you
will not find any moment.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.690
At least for the
ground state of nuclei,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.880
when you add angular
momentum, you really

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.720
change the internal structure.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.706
You have to promote
nucleons to higher orbits,

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.715
so you cannot add angular
momentum and still have

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:51.410
the same object.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.835
So therefore, you have
to say the ground state

00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:56.595
with I equals 0 has no
deformation, because there

00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:59.541
is no way to ever find
[INAUDIBLE] deformation,

00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:02.010
so it doesn't exist.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.370
But there are excited
states of nuclei

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.370
which have a deformation,
and these deformed nuclei

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.110
can be put into a multiplex
of angular momentum states.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:16.270
So then you would see, I have
the same kind of nucleus,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.490
but at different
angular momentum states.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.910
At higher angular
momentum states,

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.814
you can define [INAUDIBLE]
determine quadrupole moments

00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:26.950
and things like this.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.730
And then you may say the
same internal state has now

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.990
a non-rotating state, and
you would still be tempted,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.770
and you are correct with that,
to associate a deformation even

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.010
in the non-rotating state.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.850
I hope those remarks help
you reconcile the two aspects

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.020
whether you have an object which
is stable enough to be spun up,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.530
and then I think
you can always talk

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.175
about the body-fixed frame.

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:56.240
But if you have an object
where you change the internal

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.930
structure when you add
angular momentum, I think,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.072
for fundamental reasons,
you cannot associate any

00:13:03.072 --> 00:13:06.270
deformation with it.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.746
Any questions about that?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.920
Let me just write
down the summary.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:36.270
The definition of a deformation
in a body-fixed frame

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:55.850
makes sense only if you can
add or change angular momentum

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:05.756
without significantly changing
the internal structure.

00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:29.675
Questions?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.310
I think the computer is set up.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.584
I cannot go backward
in Presentation mode.

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:22.860
What I want to discuss
next is give you

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.315
a little bit of an historic
summary how spectroscopy

00:15:26.315 --> 00:15:30.960
of hydrogen is developed,
in particular also focusing

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.335
on one important discovery,
the discovery of QED

00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:37.100
through the Lamb shift.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.340
Of course, you all love hydrogen
because it's the simplest atom

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.580
but it has so much
interesting physics in it.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.160
I've summarized for you here
some papers on hydrogen,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.030
and I used them to
illustrate several points.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.040
I will show you that actually,
the discovery of the Lamb shift

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.580
had precursors.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.700
10 years before the Lamb
shift was discovered,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.740
people had even some
idea that something

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.910
may be wrong with
the understanding

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.360
of the structure of hydrogen.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.690
So you can say they came
so close, people 10 years

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.367
before, in realizing
the Lamb shift,

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:16.200
there were people who
maybe missed the Nobel

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.560
prize by just a tiny little bit.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.510
They had all the
insight that there

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.801
may be QED correction
in hydrogen.

00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:24.300
They just didn't
have the technology

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.150
to measure it accurately enough.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.120
The second example
I want to show

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.980
is that we always talk about
fundamental limitations,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.450
but fundamental limitations
can disappear in time

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.710
because they may not be as
fundamental as they appear.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:51.266
So for instance,
there were limitations

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:52.970
with the limitations
of the Lamb shift

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.720
because you had a short
lifetime of p states,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.330
but with the event of
two photon transition,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.380
you can go from s to
s and s to d states,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.450
and therefore map
out Lamb shifts

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.980
with much, much higher
precision not limited

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.060
by the finite
lifetime of p states.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.640
Finally, you would say Lamb
shifts are small splittings,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.152
and for many, many
years, Lamb shifts

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:21.855
were measured by
making radio frequency

00:17:21.855 --> 00:17:24.665
transitions between
two s and two p states.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:28.590
Well, today, the most accurate
measurement of the Lamb shift

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.156
is with an optical
transition where

00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:32.290
you need a much, much
higher relative precision

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.760
to see the tiny Lamb shift.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.666
But optical metrology with
direct frequency measurements

00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:43.380
and frequency combs has so
much improved in precision

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.126
that now, an optical
measurement, even if it comes

00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:49.070
to a tiny difference, is
more accurate than a direct

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.310
So I think the
history of hydrogen

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.067
shows you that
technology can completely

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.990
change the paradigm how
measurements are made.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.280
Fundamental limits
disappear because new tools

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.720
or new insight is available.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.360
And also, I find it interesting
that discoveries often

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.925
have precursors, and people
have a hunch, know about it,

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:13.297
and then finally,
it is discovered.

00:18:13.297 --> 00:18:15.380
Let me just take you through
some historic papers.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.160
This paper is 1933, 15
years before the Lamb shift,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.170
and it says that one
possible explanation

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.250
for some discrepancy of the
structure of the Balmer lines

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.060
is that the effect
of the interaction

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.680
between the radiation field and
the atom has been neglected.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.015
That's QED.

00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.758
You cannot just calculate the
structure of the hydrogen atom

00:18:55.758 --> 00:18:57.150
from the Coulomb field.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.660
You have to allow the
radiation field, all the modes

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.400
of the vacuum to be included.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.830
So this insight
is not due to Lamb

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:10.450
It was there already, 1933.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.910
Same year, look at the
title, "On the Breakdown

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.500
of the Coulomb Law for
the Hydrogen Atom."

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.360
People speculated or discussed
that the Coulomb law will not

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.090
be valid at very
small distances.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.640
This is ultimately what QED,
raided correction, the Lamb

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.480
shift, vacuum
polarization all is about.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.740
Finally, people had an
understanding of the hydrogen

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.060
atom, and they
measure-- I want you

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.900
to keep that in mind--
they did optical.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:55.350
They measured the Balmer lines
of hydrogen and deuterium,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.270
and they couldn't
fully resolve it

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.400
because of the finite
lifetime of the peak state,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.180
but there was some
hunch when you

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.030
try to get the envelope from
the underlying structure

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.780
that there was a discrepancy.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.600
It was just not significant
enough to say for sure,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.370
there is an
additional line shift

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.758
which is not accounted
for by theory.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.129
There was a
discussion that there

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:32.560
is a deviation of the Coulomb
law, but here is the insight.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.390
As was indicated by
previous authors,

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.465
the interaction required
to change the Coulomb law

00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:41.340
at small distances
is much too large

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.410
to be accounted for
by the assumption

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.180
of a finite size of
electron and proton.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.155
So the Coulomb field
has to be modified

00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:53.485
at short distances in a
much stronger way than just

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:55.710
the finite size of the proton.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.690
We'll talk about the finite
size of the proton in a minute.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:04.180
And then, of course,
1947, UIF oscillators

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.360
have been developed in
the pursuit of radar,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.060
experimental tools are there
now-- high power IF sources,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.680
cumulative sources,
and such, and then

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.834
Lamb and Retherford
in his landmark paper

00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:20.025
look at the fine structure
of the hydrogen atom,

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:22.310
and this is the famous result.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:28.510
They measured transitions as
a function of magnetic field,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.860
and you see the solid
line, which I think

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.430
was the theory without
the Lamb shift.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:38.460
The dashed line is the hyper
fine structure of hydrogen,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.630
and the lines converge,
and the difference

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.214
is 1,000 megacycles, the first
determination of the Lamb

00:21:46.214 --> 00:21:48.150
shift.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.950
So this was 1947.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.450
It's interesting
that it's just one

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.450
or two weeks later, there is
a theoretical paper by Hans

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.000
Bethe providing an explanation
for the Lamb shift,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.510
so already coming up
with the first model

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.770
how to account for QED.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.910
I didn't look it
up in detail, but I

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.450
thought the spirit was similar
to what I presented you

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.335
in class, that the
electromagnetic zero point

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:23.210
energy is shaping the electron
and leading to corrections.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.840
But it's amazing that
within weeks, theorists

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.770
figured nearly out, yes,
this is the explanation.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.120
This is how we have
to explain the theory.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.930
For a number of years,
people pursued measurements

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.250
of the Lamb shifts with
higher and higher accuracy.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.390
I just like the
last sentence here.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:52.330
This is now the next paper by
Willis Lamb and Retherford,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.150
and they are sort of saying that
they wanted to measure the Lamb

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.900
shift with higher
precision, but then they

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.630
said, "the program was
large and encountered

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.260
unexpected difficulties
which required much more time

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.290
to surmount.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.070
As a result, the paper promised
two years ago was delayed."

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.930
I think this applies to many,
many papers to be written,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.300
but here, the authors
even say that upfront,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.905
it took us two years
longer to do the research

00:23:16.905 --> 00:23:18.234
than we initially anticipated.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.990
You see now the
growing accuracy.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.770
We have the Lamb shift, which
is on the order of 1,000

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.255
megacycles, one gigahertz,
and the precision

00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:31.900
is now in the 100
kilohertz range.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.731
This was the technology
of the original discovery.

00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:40.995
Then there was a next
generation of experiments

00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:45.490
on the Lamb shift using
separated [? oscilloatomic ?]

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.260
fields, [INAUDIBLE] techniques.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.340
We'll talk about that
later in the course.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.840
And with these techniques,
the accuracy of the Lamb shift

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:03.378
is now one digit further
in the 10 kilohertz region.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.590
There is a nice feature that
we'll also discuss later,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.400
that it was possible to
obtain line weights, which

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.930
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.260
We'll talk about
it later, but it's

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:25.010
possible to do spectroscopy on
unstable states, which provides

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.083
line widths narrower than
the actual line widths.

00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:32.200
If you want to get one
sentence as an appetizer,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.970
you just look at the
atoms which have not

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.930
decayed for a long time,
and if you play some tricks,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.210
you can then get line
widths which covers points

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.970
to several lifetimes, and not
just to the one [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.380
lifetime.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.520
Some conditions have to
be met, and those authors

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.220
used it here to
advantage to narrow

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.360
the line for the measurement
of the Lamb shift.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.860
Yes?

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.180
AUDIENCE: The abstract
says that the result is not

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.530
in good agreement with theory.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:06.040
What is the theoretical--
how far had it gone?

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.870
PROFESSOR: I don't
know it at this point.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.900
I will later give you
comparison with theory

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.090
which is highly accurate.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.811
I assume at this
point-- I'm not sure

00:25:18.811 --> 00:25:20.540
if it was instrumental
difficulty.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.528
I didn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.340
So these are the same authors
just a few years later.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.320
The agreement between
theory and experiment

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.986
is two standard deviations, so I
think this problem disappeared.

00:25:37.986 --> 00:25:42.810
I don't know if it was the
fault of theory or experiment.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.680
But now we go a step forward
to optical spectroscopy.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.480
You remember originally, and
this is why the Lamb shift was

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.960
not jumping into people's eye
when they did spectroscopy

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.810
of the Balmer
spectrum of hydrogen,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.680
you cannot resolve
the structure.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.540
The Lamb shift is
there, but it's

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.650
hidden in the envelope
of the unresolved lines.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.550
And now the advent
of lasers, and people

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.952
immediately developed
saturation spectroscopy.

00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:19.410
That's how most of
our laboratories

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.010
stabilize lasers using
Doppler-free saturation

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.220
spectroscopy.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.460
And when saturation
spectroscopy was invented

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.950
by Hansch and Schawlow
for the first time,

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.230
you can break through
the Doppler [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.510
and now you see
the lines resolved.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.120
And here, I think
for the first time,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.065
you see two peaks
separated and the splitting

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:43.140
is the Lamb shift, which
until then was only accessible

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.370
through [INAUDIBLE]
frequency methods.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.496
Of course, these were the first
lasers, just pulsed lasers,

00:26:50.496 --> 00:26:52.880
and we couldn't even
think about precision.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.400
But then, of course,
using metrology,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.750
using frequency chains, people
could do precision measurements

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.100
in the optical domain.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.930
These are now papers in the
'90s, "Optical Measurement

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:20.110
on the Lamb Shift in the Ground
State or in the Excited State."

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.380
Talking about the comparison
with experiment and theory,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.670
experimental is pushed to
higher and higher precision,

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.800
and suddenly, there
was a discrepancy,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.300
and it was a discrepancy
in the 1s Lamb shift.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.344
In the 1s state, the
Lamb shift is much bigger

00:27:35.344 --> 00:27:41.630
than in the 2s state because
the electron interacts much more

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:46.225
intimately with the [INAUDIBLE]
than the Coulomb potential is

00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:47.600
on this.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.270
People found that the
experiment did no longer

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.490
agree with theory.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.630
But then the theorists had to
check all their assumptions,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.565
and it was found that there
were two new binding corrections

00:28:00.565 --> 00:28:02.505
which were surprisingly large.

00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:06.030
Often, you make an estimate
that those terms are small.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.917
You say it's higher
order, but you may not

00:28:08.917 --> 00:28:10.200
know the pre-factor.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.350
And here, something
was surprisingly large,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.440
and by now you're
proving the theory.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.520
There was again agreement
between experiment and theory.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.780
It's getting now down
to the kilohertz level.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:28.610
And at least as a few years
ago, this was state of the art.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.090
Remember the Lamb shift is about
1,000 cycles one gigahertz,

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.988
and now the precision is
in the single kilohertz.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.620
As I pointed out,
precision was reached

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.860
by directly measuring the
frequency of laser, frequency

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.850
metrology.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.950
This was actually, for historic
interest, frequency metrology,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:29:00.320
they used peak nodes
between the laser used

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.380
to measure the hydrogen
line and some other lasers.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.620
This is just a few years
before comb generators.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.926
Frequency combs completely
changed things again.

00:29:10.926 --> 00:29:13.594
But they had already the
precision of a direct frequency

00:29:13.594 --> 00:29:15.330
measurement.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.090
You can read about
it when I paused it.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.510
It shows you what
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.810
is in those installations.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.150
This is a slide I
borrowed from Ted Hansch,

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.545
"Optical Spectroscopy
of Hydrogen."

00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:32.440
It just shows the advances
in frequency metrology.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:41.060
It shows how caesium clocks
and optical spectroscopy,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.960
how they have
changed in precision,

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.485
and eventually, we
are now past the time

00:29:47.485 --> 00:29:52.470
where optical spectroscopy is
more accurate than microwave

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.895
and radio frequency
spectroscopy.

00:29:54.895 --> 00:29:58.290
Optical clocks are more accurate
than [INAUDIBLE] frequency

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.760
standards.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.400
I'm sure in your
lifetime, you will

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.620
experience the
redefinition of this

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.870
again because the caesium clock
is no longer accurate enough

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.870
compared with the most
precise optical measurements.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.090
And I think there was a peak
gap, a change in slope here.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:23.156
In the old days, you measured
the wavelengths of light

00:30:23.156 --> 00:30:27.870
by making a measurement of
the wavelengths using maybe

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.860
a grading or interferometry,
but when you now

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.560
started to measure
frequencies directly,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.990
then there was a change in
slope and major improvements

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.376
in precision.

00:30:38.376 --> 00:30:40.686
And today, of course, the
most precise measurement

00:30:40.686 --> 00:30:45.180
of laser frequencies is not
through the wavelengths,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:49.284
that they can count the number
of cycles in a peak node

00:30:49.284 --> 00:30:51.679
with an optical comb generator.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.244
So what can you do with
ever increasing precision?

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.880
This is also a slide I
borrowed from Ted Hansch.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.960
If you measure very, very
accurately an atomic line,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.555
let's say the 1s 2s transition
in hydrogen using two photon

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:17.258
spectroscopy, what you can
do is you can measure it,

00:31:17.258 --> 00:31:19.960
and a few years later,
you can measure it again.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.165
And now it becomes an
interesting question

00:31:22.165 --> 00:31:23.290
if you have this precision.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.734
Will the result be the
same as a function of time?

00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:33.550
If there were a small change,
which there wasn't, you

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.040
could only come
to one conclusion,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.460
and this is fundamental
common sense in nature,

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.710
change is a function of time.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.190
So this precision
of metrology is now

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.828
being used to test the
fundamental constants, again,

00:31:46.828 --> 00:31:49.238
constant as a function of time.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.380
Precision is even
more improving.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.575
The latest in the development
in the spectroscopy of hydrogen

00:32:04.575 --> 00:32:09.026
is what is called the
size of the proton atom.

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:11.805
In your homework
assignment, you are actually

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:16.300
calculating what is the
correction due to transition

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.330
frequencies in
hydrogen because you

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.438
don't have a proton field
of a point particle.

00:32:22.438 --> 00:32:24.310
The proton has a finite size.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.520
Or vice versa, if you have
sufficient prediction,

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.020
if you have sufficient
accuracy of the measurement,

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.632
you can determine the
size of the proton

00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:35.340
from the measured
transition frequencies.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:44.160
This was done, and in 2010,
there was a big surprise

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.415
that the size of the proton
determined from hydrogen

00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:52.290
spectroscopy did not agree
with scattering measurements

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.592
where you scatter electrons and
protons to measure the proton

00:32:56.592 --> 00:32:58.330
size.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.970
This is still a puzzle.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.835
It's called the
proton radius puzzle,

00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:07.705
and it is not clear
what is causing it.

00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:11.952
What happened is in 2010,
there was a big improvement

00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:15.110
in measuring the
size of the proton,

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:20.440
and this was done by replacing
the electron with a muon, which

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.425
is a heavy electron, but since
the muon is so much heavier,

00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:29.470
the bore orbit of the muon,
the negative particle going

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.960
around the proton,
it is much smaller.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.790
Therefore, the Lamb
shift also, but also

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.830
the correction due to the
finite size of the proton,

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.865
is much, much
larger because there

00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:49.410
is much more overlay
of the muonic wave

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.790
function with a proton
than for an electron.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.850
So there was a huge
improvement in the precision

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.810
of the measurement
of the proton size,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.180
and this has really
led to what's

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.750
called the proton radius puzzle.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:08.244
It's not sure if that is at the
same level of the Lamb shift,

00:34:08.244 --> 00:34:10.714
which gave rise to
fundamental new physics.

00:34:10.714 --> 00:34:13.750
Maybe this is the discovery
of the new Lamb shift in 2010,

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:18.070
and it changes our understanding
of fundamental physics,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.488
but maybe it's something else.

00:34:20.488 --> 00:34:24.080
The answer is not [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.620
At least this is 2010.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.280
A few years of
checking the theory

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.175
and checking the experiment has
not removed the discrepancy.

00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:34.495
Rather to the contrary.

00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:38.541
It has hardened that there
is some discrepancy which

00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:42.219
needs to be resolved.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.612
So this was just a
little shot of excursion,

00:34:44.612 --> 00:34:47.920
a little bit of summary of
spectroscopy of hydrogen

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.190
over 80 years, from
precursors to the Lamb shift

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.440
to the proton radius puzzle.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.600
AUDIENCE: So I
know the same group

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.390
was using the same technique to
measure deuterium, maybe helium

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.015
PROFESSOR: I think they want to
do it but they haven't done it.

00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:09.490
That's what they plan to do.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.975
AUDIENCE: That was my question.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.674
PROFESSOR: So our
next topic are now

00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:36.144
atoms in external
magnetic fields.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:14.510
The first chapter is on fine
structure and the lambda g

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.010
factor.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.685
But maybe more colloquially,
atoms in external fields

00:36:21.685 --> 00:36:26.296
means that we add one
more vector to the mix.

00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:29.390
In fine structure, we have
orbital angular momentum

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.390
and spin angular
momentum, and we

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.437
discussed how spin orbit
coupling eventually

00:36:35.437 --> 00:36:40.742
couples L and S to J and so
on, but now, we extend the game

00:36:40.742 --> 00:36:46.850
by one more vector, B, an
external magnetic field.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.750
It really becomes a
player in the game

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.665
because you know that if you
have spin orbit coupling,

00:36:53.665 --> 00:36:58.770
we use the vector model that
L and S couple and precess

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:04.850
around the axis of J, the
total angular momentum.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.386
So the game we play when we
couple angular momentum is

00:37:08.386 --> 00:37:10.506
that angular
momentum couple, they

00:37:10.506 --> 00:37:13.210
precess around an axis
that involves some quantum

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.100
numbers and so on.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.460
But now, you can add a
new quantization axis

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.690
with a magnetic field,
and then angular momenta

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:26.340
will precess around
the magnetic field.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.310
And there may be
actually a conflict,

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.157
that for strong magnetic
field, the precession is

00:37:31.157 --> 00:37:33.652
different than in
weak magnetic fields,

00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:36.150
and this is what we
want to discuss now.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:47.050
So it is the game
of L, S, and B.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:52.090
So what we are adding
with magnetic fields

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.880
is we are adding one term
to the Hamiltonian, which

00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:05.360
is the Zeeman term, where we
have an external magnetic field

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.142
and we couple with
a magnetic moment.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.970
The one thing which
makes it interesting

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.850
when we discuss fine
structure is the following,

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:23.560
that we have actually two
components to the angular

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.942
momentum of the atom,
which is the spin

00:38:26.942 --> 00:38:29.720
and the orbital
angular momentum,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.215
and the two have
different g factors.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.706
So it's not that
the magnetic moment

00:38:38.706 --> 00:38:41.171
is just proportional to
the angular momentum.

00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:43.841
If the angular momentum
comes from spin,

00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:47.160
it has a different weight than
when the angular momentum comes

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.860
from orbital angular
momentum, and this

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.850
is what we want
to now understand.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.260
We want to determine what
is the magnetic moment

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.843
of the atom when the
angular momentum has

00:39:03.843 --> 00:39:06.150
two different sources?

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.640
What we will find is we will
find that there is a lambda g

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.520
factor which is sometimes
2, which is sometimes 1,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.350
or which is sometimes
somewhere in between,

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.550
depending how S
and L are arranged

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.994
with respect to each other.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.264
So our Hamiltonian is the
Hamiltonian for the atom.

00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:32.685
We know that we
have fine structure,

00:39:32.685 --> 00:39:39.580
we discussed that,
which couples L and S.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:40:14.050
And now have a magnetic
moment due to the spin

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.540
and due to the orbital
angular momentum,

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.363
and then couples to the
external magnetic field.

00:40:22.363 --> 00:40:26.686
In other words, if we had
no fine structure coupling,

00:40:26.686 --> 00:40:30.200
if S and L would not
be coupled, the answer

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.970
would be very simple.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.970
S just couples to
the magnetic field,

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.462
gives the same [INAUDIBLE],
the g factor of 2,

00:40:37.462 --> 00:40:42.362
and L couples to the magnetic
field with a g factor of 1.

00:40:42.362 --> 00:40:45.870
But now the two are coupled
with respect to each other,

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:51.205
and if you have L-S coupling,
the projection of S and L

00:40:51.205 --> 00:40:54.680
on the z-axis is not a good
quantum number anymore.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.620
So therefore, we have
two different terms

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.670
which are diagonal in
two different bases,

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:05.380
and that's what we
want to discuss.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.870
So the g factor of orbital
angular momentum is 1.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:19.000
The g factor of the
spin is 2, or if you

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.100
want to include the leading
correction here from QED,

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.980
it's the fine structure
constant over 2 pi.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:44.120
We did discuss that
the fine structure can

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.650
be related as the Zeeman
energy of the spin

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.180
in a magnetic field
which is created

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.650
by the electron
due to its motion.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.620
Or, if you take the
frame of the electron,

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.935
the electron sees
the proton orbiting

00:41:59.935 --> 00:42:02.300
around that creates
a magnetic field,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.980
and this magnetic field
couples to the state.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.760
So therefore, we can
associate fine structure

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.272
with an internal magnetic
field inside the atom.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.190
And this internal magnetic
field is rather large.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.270
It's on the order of 1 Tesla.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:35.170
So therefore, for our discussion
of the lambda g factor and fine

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.880
structure in applied
magnetic fields,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:45.250
we will assume that we are
in the weak field limit

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.950
where the fine structure
term, the first term,

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:54.170
is much larger than
the Zeeman term.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.995
Of course, if you use
very strong magnets,

00:42:55.995 --> 00:42:58.520
you can go to the
high field case,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.990
but I will discuss explicitly
the transition from weak field

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.810
to high field for
hyperfine structure,

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.573
and the phenomenon
for fine structure

00:43:07.573 --> 00:43:08.862
is completely analogous.

00:43:08.862 --> 00:43:11.760
It just happens at
much higher fields.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.268
So anyway, I will discuss the
high field case and transition

00:43:15.268 --> 00:43:18.928
with the high field case with
a much more elegant example

00:43:18.928 --> 00:43:22.100
of hyperfine structure
that you can immediately

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.052
apply to fine
structure if you like.

00:43:32.896 --> 00:43:41.210
If I want to solve the problem,
calculate the lambda g factor,

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:51.080
I could directly calculate
just one matrix element

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.888
and it would be done.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.240
So all I want to know
is what is the Zeeman

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.830
energy because Zeeman energy
divided by the magnetic field

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.270
is the magnetic moment.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.960
And since I assume that I'm
in the weak field limit,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.665
I can simply use the
quantum numbers S, L, and S

00:44:15.665 --> 00:44:22.552
and L coupled to J, and the
magnetic quantum number is nJ.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:41.560
So by simply calculating this
expectation value, I'm done

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.935
and I've solved the problem.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:00.080
However, I want to do the
derivation using the vector

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.865
model because it provides
some additional insight.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:19.730
So in the vector model, we
have L and S coupled to J

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:21.510
to the total angular momentum.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:32.355
And in the vector model, we
assume that L and S rapidly

00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:41.590
precess around J. And therefore,
the only thing which matters

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:45.528
are the projections.

00:45:45.528 --> 00:45:51.090
Only the projections of L and
S on the J-axis are important.

00:45:53.905 --> 00:45:56.280
So you can say if you have an
rapid precession of L and S

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.220
around J, the transverse
components rapidly average

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.190
out and [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.075
So therefore, our
Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:46:09.075 --> 00:46:12.750
has to be rewritten
in the following way.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.290
The Zeeman Hamiltonian
was the magnetic moment

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.930
times the external magnetic
field with a minus sign.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:39.420
But what matters is the
projection on the J direction,

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.490
so we do the
projection in this way.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.640
And also, in the
end, what matters

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.230
is, since the magnetic
moments are aligned with J,

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:59.880
it is now the scalar product
of the magnetic field with J.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.950
So in the vector model, we
calculate the Zeeman energies

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:11.060
in that way, but just to
mention that if you don't

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.450
like the vector model and the
assumption of rapid precession,

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.140
just take this matrix element.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.190
It's exactly the same.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.740
In other words, I give
you the intuitive picture

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.440
what is inside those
matrix elements.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.070
So let's evaluate that.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:37.800
Let me factor out
the Bohr magneton.

00:47:42.533 --> 00:47:48.990
We have J squared, taking
one of each bracket.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:55.890
And now assuming that the
g factor of the spin is 2,

00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:01.370
the magnetic moment is the
Bohr magneton times L--

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:09.370
the g factor of L is 1-- plus
S, but the g factor of S is 2.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.972
So this is now the
magnetic moment accounting

00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:18.140
for the two different g factors
we projected on the J-axis.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:23.080
And the second racket,
B dot J becomes

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.710
the value of the magnetic field.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.160
We assume the magnetic field
points in the z direction,

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.465
so therefore, it is the z
component of the total angular

00:48:31.465 --> 00:48:31.965
momentum.

00:48:40.414 --> 00:48:44.900
Let me collect the simple terms.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:54.250
Now L plus 2S,
because L plus S is J,

00:48:54.250 --> 00:49:01.130
can be written as J plus S.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:09.630
So now we have the product
of J with J, which gives us

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:21.140
J squared, and then we need
the product of S and J.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:27.310
And as usual, we can get
an expression for that

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:31.210
by using the summation
of angular momenta.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:35.190
If we square it on
the right hand side,

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:40.510
we have the scalar
product of J and S,

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.005
but we have now the
scalar product of J and S

00:49:43.005 --> 00:49:45.122
expressed by L
squared J squared.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:59.416
J squared plus S squared minus
L squared divided by J squared.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:18.085
Now, we're just one line
away from the final result.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.100
Jz is a good quantum number.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.346
It's MJ, the projection
of the total angular

00:50:32.346 --> 00:50:33.834
momentum on the z-axis.

00:50:40.835 --> 00:50:45.970
The bracket here is
now the famous result

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.360
for the lambda g factor.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.440
So we have J squared over J
squared, which gives us 1.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:08.390
And then I simply put
in the quantum numbers

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.980
for J squared, S
squared, L squared, which

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:16.020
is J times J plus 1
plus S times S plus 1

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:23.050
minus L times L plus 1, and
we divide by 2 times J plus 1.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.930
So therefore, the Zeeman
structure in a magnetic field

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.298
is the Bohr magneton
times the magnetic field

00:51:37.298 --> 00:51:40.100
times the angular momentum
in the J direction,

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.984
but then we multiply
with the g factor.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.285
These are now limiting cases.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:52:06.452
If we do not have spin,
then the only ingredients,

00:52:06.452 --> 00:52:08.400
the only [INAUDIBLE]
angular momentum

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.110
is orbital angular momentum
and we have a g factor of 1.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.706
So the lambda g factor
simply becomes gL.

00:52:15.706 --> 00:52:19.190
In the case we don't
have angular momentum,

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:23.940
you can just evaluate this
expression for L equals 0.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:29.780
You find indeed that
the g factor is 2.

00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:37.474
But it can have
different values.

00:52:37.474 --> 00:52:39.904
It depends on the
atomic structure.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.730
That's all I want to
say about fine structure

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.827
in a magnetic field.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.080
The next step is now
hyperfine structure.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.904
We are adding one more
vector to the game.

00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:25.380
So we add angular
momentum of the nucleus,

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.300
so now the game being
played is not only L and S.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:36.000
We have I and B. It's a
game of the four vectors

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.794
and eventually how they
precess around each other,

00:53:38.794 --> 00:53:43.715
and that gives rise to the
structure of hyperfine levels

00:53:43.715 --> 00:53:45.432
in an external magnetic field.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:54.700
We assume that L and
S have coupled to J,

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.375
so we have actually
a coupling of J, I,

00:53:57.375 --> 00:54:00.953
but now we have an external
quantization axis in Zeeman.

00:54:00.953 --> 00:54:05.770
It has to be due to the
external magnetic field.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.800
And of course, in
hyperfine structure,

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:13.710
we discussed that I and J are
no longer conserved angular

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.231
momenta because they couple to
a total angular momentum, which

00:54:17.231 --> 00:54:20.880
is F.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:30.100
So our Hamiltonian
is the Hamiltonian

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:34.780
without any kind of
hyperfine and fine structure

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.350
when we have the hyperfine
coupling, which couples I

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:44.190
and J with the product
I dot J. And then we

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:49.050
have an external magnetic
field, which couples

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:56.646
to the magnetic moment
of the electron.

00:54:56.646 --> 00:55:01.760
This may be a smaller term, but
you can easily carry with us.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.760
There's also a coupling with the
magnetic moment of the nucleus.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.480
So in this case, because
the hyperfine structure

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.990
is smaller than
the fine structure,

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.240
I want to discuss both the
weak field and the strong field

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:25.800
case.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.966
Because magnetic fields of
a few hundred [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:27.966 --> 00:55:32.020
may actually take into
the high field momentum.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:38.324
I want to discuss both the low
field and the high field limit.

00:55:38.324 --> 00:55:43.865
The low field limit implies
that the Zeeman energies

00:55:43.865 --> 00:55:47.124
are much smaller than
the hyperfine splittings.

00:55:53.377 --> 00:56:05.410
And then the way we describe the
system is that J and I couple.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.650
So J, which is responsible
for the magnetic moment,

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:16.290
precesses around F, the
total angular momentum,

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.325
but then the total
angular momentum

00:56:18.325 --> 00:56:21.070
precesses around
the magnetic field.

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:24.830
In other words, you assume that
the coupling between J and I

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:27.296
is so strong and
they couple to F,

00:56:27.296 --> 00:56:29.060
the magnetic field
is not breaking up

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:34.700
the coupling between J and
I. J and I together form F,

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:37.560
and this hyperfine state,
this magnetic moment,

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.669
precesses around B.

00:56:41.669 --> 00:56:42.835
This is sort of the picture.

00:56:42.835 --> 00:56:44.220
You have to get used to it.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.450
J precesses around
F and F precesses

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:50.030
around the external
magnetic field, B0.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:58.960
But again, if you don't
like the precession model,

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.855
just calculate the
quantum mechanical energy

00:57:01.855 --> 00:57:03.770
that will stabilize
the Hamiltonian.

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.718
The answer is identical.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:28.866
The Zeeman Hamiltonian
couples to the magnetic field,

00:57:28.866 --> 00:57:34.850
and we have two contributions
to the magnetic moment,

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:36.978
the electron of the nucleus.

00:57:36.978 --> 00:57:42.510
And in the weak field
limit, we use a treatment

00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:46.984
which is almost completely
analogous to the treatment we

00:57:46.984 --> 00:57:50.442
used when we derived the
[INAUDIBLE] g factor.

00:57:59.334 --> 00:58:02.166
We can treat the
same as Hamiltonian

00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:10.680
perturbation theory, and
it's exactly analogous

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.810
when we added a weak magnetic
field to the fine structure.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:33.150
In the vector model, we
have the coupling of J and I

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:40.170
to F. The relevant
term in the Hamiltonian

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:46.800
is we have the magnetic
moment of the electron, which

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:52.040
is proportionate to J
and it couples to B.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.020
So this relevant term, this
is fully analogous to what

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.350
I did five or 10
minutes ago, has

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:02.610
to be replaced in the presence
of the nuclear angular

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:03.550
momentum.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:12.093
We have to project everything
on the axis of the total angular

00:59:12.093 --> 00:59:22.960
momentum, F.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:32.210
Therefore, the
Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:40.495
had the contribution
to the magnetic moment

00:59:40.495 --> 00:59:45.790
due to the electron
and due to the nucleus.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.100
This is proportionate
to J, but now we

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:56.620
have to project it onto F. And
similarly, the magnetic moment

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.100
of the nucleus is
proportionate to I,

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.140
but what matters is
the projection on F.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:10.650
And since I factored
out the Bohr magneton,

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.950
the magnetic moment
of the nucleus

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:16.610
is proportionate to
the nuclear magneton.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.200
I have to account for the ratio.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.470
What matters now is the
projection of F on B0.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:37.020
So therefore, collecting
all the terms,

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.670
we have the Bohr
magneton, which is

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.250
setting the scale
of the interaction.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.770
The last term is
the magnetic field,

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.950
but the projection of F
onto the magnetic field

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:56.540
gives us the mF quantum
number, and all the rest

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.707
is called the g factor of
the hyperfine structure.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.256
And the g factor of
the hyperfine structure

01:01:07.256 --> 01:01:19.090
is-- let me just
simplify and neglect

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:21.590
the small contribution--
it's 1,000 times smaller--

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:25.610
of the nuclear magnetic
moment, but if you want,

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:29.265
you can easily include it.

01:01:29.265 --> 01:01:37.522
With this approximation,
the g factor

01:01:37.522 --> 01:01:47.660
of the hyperfine
structure is this.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:53.220
It's proportionate to the
lambda g factor we just derived.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.120
And then using exactly
the same thing,

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.920
you have J dot F. You
can express it now

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.930
by the quantum numbers of F
squared, J squared, I squared.

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:21.280
You find the final
result, what are

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.060
the g factors of the
hyperfine levels,

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.980
of the hyperfine states.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:35.300
So this is the hyperfine
structure of atoms [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:35.970
magnetic fields.

01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:42.568
Let's immediately go to
the high field limit.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:54.870
The high field limit means that
the electronic Zeeman energy

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:59.554
is much larger than
the hyperfine coupling.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:17.357
And that means always,
when we treat the problem,

01:03:17.357 --> 01:03:20.766
we first take care of
the big contributions

01:03:20.766 --> 01:03:21.740
to the Hamiltonian.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.175
We try to solve it, if
possible, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:28.419
And then the weaker term
can be any perturbative.

01:03:28.419 --> 01:03:30.710
So now we are in the situation
that the Zeeman coupling

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:34.246
is the big term and
the hyperfine coupling

01:03:34.246 --> 01:03:35.980
is the weaker term.

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:47.060
So in other words, what comes
first now is the Zeeman energy,

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:51.180
so we are not coupling the
electronic angular momentum

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.084
and the nuclear angular momentum
to total angular momentum

01:03:55.084 --> 01:03:57.820
because this coupling is weak.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:02.230
We rather say that
the electronic

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.620
and the nuclear angular momentum
align with the magnetic field.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:11.450
We quantize along the direction
of the magnetic field,

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:14.103
and then later we add
the hyperfine coupling

01:04:14.103 --> 01:04:16.070
in a determinative way.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:26.380
So B0 now quantizes
J along the direction

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:31.449
of the magnetic field,
and therefore we use,

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:35.345
as a good quantum
number, J, the projection

01:04:35.345 --> 01:04:37.780
of J on the external
magnetic field axis.

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:51.180
So this takes care of J. J and
mJ are good quantum numbers.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.180
What about I?

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:58.070
Does the nuclear
angular momentum

01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:00.645
and the nuclear magnetic
moment strongly couple

01:05:00.645 --> 01:05:03.580
to the magnetic field?

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:07.315
Well, the answer is
yes, but the argument

01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:09.416
is a little bit more subtle.

01:05:09.416 --> 01:05:13.225
The direct coupling
of the magnetic moment

01:05:13.225 --> 01:05:16.232
of the nucleus with
the magnetic field

01:05:16.232 --> 01:05:24.590
may be smaller than the
hyperfine interaction.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:37.480
So then you would say, the
nuclear angular momentum

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.190
should not couple to
the magnetic field.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.510
It should first be coupled
to the hyperfine interaction.

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:52.310
The hyperfine interaction
is I dot J. However,

01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:56.290
J, which couples strongly
to the magnetic field

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:58.576
because it couples
to the Bohr magneton,

01:05:58.576 --> 01:06:01.930
has already been coupled
to the magnetic field.

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:13.470
So therefore, the hyperfine
interaction, which is I dot J,

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.620
is now modified
because J couples

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.805
to the magnetic
field, which means

01:06:19.805 --> 01:06:23.900
we have to project it onto
the magnetic field axis.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.379
So therefore, the
nucleus now experiences

01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:30.920
an electronic magnetic moment
or electronic angular momentum,

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.420
which has already been
coupled to the z-axis.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.610
And therefore, the
hyperfine interaction

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:43.602
is also coupling the nuclear
angular momentum to the z-axis.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:53.150
So therefore, the
result is that it is now

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.945
this indirect coupling.

01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:57.975
You couple the electron
angular momentum to the z-axis

01:06:57.975 --> 01:06:59.835
and the electron
angular momentum

01:06:59.835 --> 01:07:04.600
couples the nuclear angular
momentum to the z-axis.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:11.090
So now this quantizes the
nuclear angular momentum

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.600
along the z-axis,
which means that n

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.225
sub I becomes a
good quantum number.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.910
Anyway, maybe the result is even
simpler than the explanation.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.980
Our Zeeman
Hamiltonian now simply

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:34.170
means that we have an
external magnetic field

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:41.320
and you the electron couples
to the magnetic field,

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.140
so what matters is
the projection, mJ.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:54.950
The same happens for the
nuclear magnetic moment,

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.330
and now we have to add the
hyperfine interaction, which

01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:07.340
was originally I dot J, but
since I and J are projected

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:14.132
on the z-axis, what is really
left over are only mI and mJ.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.619
I could have gotten this
expression immediately

01:08:19.619 --> 01:08:24.609
by just telling you, J and
I no longer couple to F.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:27.440
This is destroyed by a
strong magnetic field,

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.126
and the good quantum numbers are
J and I and their projection,

01:08:32.126 --> 01:08:33.779
mJ and mI.

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:36.450
And then just writing
down the expectation value

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:38.490
of the Hamiltonian
in these spaces

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:41.630
would have immediately
given me this result.

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:46.510
I wanted to give you the more
mechanistic explanation what's

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:49.932
going on inside the atom and
what leads to this result.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:05.979
I have discussed for you the two
limiting cases, the weak field

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:11.080
and the strong field case,
but you can solve it also

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.670
for intermediate fields.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:23.148
You simply have to do
an exact diagonalization

01:09:23.148 --> 01:09:29.176
of the Hamiltonian,
which involves

01:09:29.176 --> 01:09:30.134
the hyperfine coupling.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.580
And the hyperfine
coupling, if you want,

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:41.986
can be diagonalized
as eigenfunctions

01:09:41.986 --> 01:09:48.580
where the quantums numbers
are J, I coupled to F,

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:57.070
and the projection of F, the
magnetic quantum number is mF.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:06.700
But now we have the Zeeman
Hamiltonian, where everything

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:11.115
is projected on the z-axis,
so we have mJ and mI.

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:25.250
And the Zeeman term
can be diagonalized

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:33.156
in a different basis, which is
the basis of J, I, mJ, and mI.

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:45.950
So I've shown you the weak
field limit, where we simply

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.700
assume those quantum
numbers and calculate

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.850
this term determinatively, and
I've shown you the high field

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:53.850
limit, where we used
those quantum numbers

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.040
and calculated this
field determinatively.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.860
But in general, you
just have to write down

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.950
the matrix element of this
Hamiltonian in whatever basis

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.620
you choose.

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.420
You can use the
weak field basis.

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:09.610
This term is diagonal.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:10.540
This is off diagonal.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.100
Or you can use the
strong field basis

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.849
where this is the diagonal
and this is off diagonal

01:11:15.849 --> 01:11:17.900
and simply diagonalize
your Hamiltonian.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.070
Find the wave function,
find the I energies.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:26.960
And since, for cases
where S equals 1/2,

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.295
it's only a two by two matrix
which has to be diagonalized,

01:11:30.295 --> 01:11:32.654
you can do it
analytically, and this

01:11:32.654 --> 01:11:34.320
leads to the famous
[INAUDIBLE] formula.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:59.720
So the solution is
analytic for J equals 1/2,

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.262
and it's a beautiful
example which

01:12:02.262 --> 01:12:04.742
you should solve in your
homework assignment.

01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:10.830
Let me just sketch the solution.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:26.350
When you go from the weak field
to the strong field limit,

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:31.750
the z component of the total
angular momentum in one case

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:33.516
is mF.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:38.560
In the other case,
it is mI plus mJ.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.850
So when you go from
one limit to the next,

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:47.682
you connect only states
where mI plus mJ equals mF.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:05.160
So the structure of
the general solution

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:22.360
can be explained by repulsion
and anti-crossings of states

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:29.796
with the same
[INAUDIBLE] number.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.180
So let me show you the weak
field, the strong field limit,

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.011
and do a graphic interpolation.

01:13:50.566 --> 01:13:59.410
What I've chosen as an example
is the case of a 2 duplet S 1/2

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:06.900
ground state and a nuclear
angular momentum of 3/2.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.340
Examples for that is
sodium and rubidium 87.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.895
This is magnetic field.

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:44.053
At weak magnetic field
or zero magnetic field,

01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:50.160
the spin 1/2 couples
to the nucleus in 3/2,

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:58.035
and that gives to
hyperfine states F

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:04.965
equals 1 and F equals 2.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:15.200
The splitting is given by
the hyperfine constant, a,

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:23.700
and the hyperfine interaction
is A times H times I times S.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.010
The structure is such that the
center of mass of the energy

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:31.700
levels is preserved,
so therefore, one state

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.490
is moved up by 3/4 a.

01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:36.800
The other state is
moved down by 5/4.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.950
And since F equals 1
has three components,

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.930
F equals 2 has five
components, the center of mass

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.230
is preserved.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:51.696
We have calculated the g
factor for those states,

01:15:51.696 --> 01:15:55.150
and the g factor
tells us what is

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.900
the structure in
weak magnetic fields.

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:07.130
So this is the weak
magnetic field solution.

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:10.020
At high magnetic
field, you know what

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.180
you have in high magnetic field.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:16.060
You have a single electron
which can spin up and spin down.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.610
So if you have an electron
which is spin up and spin down,

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:24.560
it pretty much is linear
Zeeman shift for spin down

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.760
and linear Zeeman
shift for spin up.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.760
This is sort of what we expect.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:50.780
So what will happen is
that the energy levels

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:54.335
will evolve like this.

01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:04.900
So in other words,
we have eight levels.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.966
We have the structure
at weak magnetic fields.

01:17:07.966 --> 01:17:10.130
At high magnetic
fields, of course,

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.745
we also have eight levels, but
they pretty much group into

01:17:13.745 --> 01:17:17.450
spin up of the electron,
spin down of the electron.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:20.400
And then there is a
smaller hyperfine structure

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.470
on top of it because
now the nuclear spin

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:25.100
can have various orientations.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.980
And I equals 3/2 state
has four orientations,

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.785
so therefore, electron spin
up and electron spin down

01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:34.830
will obtain four sub-levels.

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.430
And if you ask how
did I connected,

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:46.950
I've connected the quantum
numbers as such what is here,

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:50.030
the states are
labeled by mI and mS,

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.995
and here, they're
labeled by mF, but mF

01:17:52.995 --> 01:17:57.095
equals mI plus mS. This
is how you correlate

01:17:57.095 --> 01:17:59.972
the states in the
high field case

01:17:59.972 --> 01:18:02.442
to the states in
the low field case.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:20.160
I'm running out of time, but
here, we have mJ equals 1/2.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.860
Here we have the
electron spin minus 1/2.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:45.250
These four levels are now
four different quantum numbers

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:49.460
for the nuclear
angular momentum, which

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:57.990
are minus 3/2, minus 1/2,
plus 1/2, and plus 3/2.

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:06.610
And this is what I meant
by avoided crossing.

01:19:10.942 --> 01:19:12.650
At some point, I think,
draw it yourself,

01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:16.760
put the quantum numbers
on it, and you'll

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.000
learn a lot by doing it.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.895
What you realize also when
you solve the Hamiltonian

01:19:20.895 --> 01:19:26.480
that this structure can be
explained the following way.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.346
You will always find you
have some states which

01:19:31.346 --> 01:19:35.450
are stretched, where there
is only one state which

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:39.980
has the maximum angular
momentum inside all

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.890
the stretched states.

01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:44.080
And then the other
states, you always

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.260
need to find two states
which have the same total mF,

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.630
and those two states
avoid each other.

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:56.860
You can say, just pointing on
two states, those two states,

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.920
let's just assume
they have the same mF.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.955
They undergo an
avoided crossing,

01:20:01.955 --> 01:20:04.220
and that's exactly
what you get out

01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.730
of the diagonalization
of the two by two matrix.

01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:09.240
So this whole diagram
can be understood

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.090
by you have stretched states
which form a one by one matrix.

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:16.260
There is no recoupling
taking place.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:23.300
And then you have three pairs
of states which form two

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.920
by two matrix, and in each pair,
if you would now focus on it,

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.418
you really see the avoided
crossing typical for a two

01:20:31.418 --> 01:20:32.666
by two matrix.

01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:38.155
Any questions about that?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.470
The next thing would be to go
through some bigger questions

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:46.740
and review atomic
structure, including

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.270
external magnetic fields.

01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:52.770
But we'll do that at the
beginning of the next class.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.690
PROFESSOR: Today I want to walk
through that case in quotes.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.430
It's more of a teaching
note than a case,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.140
but there are some questions
to talk about and let

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.170
me pose one that probably
occurred to some of you

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.930
as you began reading the
course-- reading that case.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.250
Why are we talking about EPA at
the front of a case on energy?

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.530
Sam?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.485
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.890
But especially it
can depends a lot

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.330
on where your energy comes from.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.747
Like, [INAUDIBLE]
talked about how

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.140
the coal causes like a
lot of more [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.640
than [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.190
PROFESSOR: So on
the one hand energy,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.065
Energy is the source of
the kind of pollution

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:10.350
EPA was created to deal
with, and on the other hand--

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.698
STUDENT: Also the different
regulations impact [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:17.950
deductions [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.970
PROFESSOR: So a lot
of energy policy

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.185
is made in under the umbrella
of environmental policy.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.570
Plus or minus coal is not
going to be about coal,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.687
but it's going to be about--

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.020
or not going to be about energy.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.585
It's going to be
about the environment.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:37.710
Let me call your attention.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.720
This was an optional reading
but the National Academy

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.430
of Sciences unpriced
consequences paper is probably

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.040
the best recent summary
of this literature,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.460
and it talks about putting
climate to one side.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.990
We'll come back to that.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.200
It credits coal-fired power
plants in 2005 with $62 billion

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.780
worth of damages--

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.750
externalities,
unpriced consequences

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.820
with a huge range per
kilowatt hour in the damages

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.430
caused by individual plants.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.480
Natural gas fired power
plants, much less in aggregate

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.910
and, in fact, much less, except
for a few cases, per plant.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.500
Transportation, both light
duty, cars and light trucks,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.260
and heavy duty, heavy
trucks and equipment,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.510
add up to about $56 billion.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.030
Not that far off--

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.895
not that far off
coal-fired power plants.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.270
The other interesting thing--
and we'll come back to this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.340
later later today--

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.860
there's a little-- there's a
parenthetical assessment where

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.230
they say-- where they
look at alternative forms

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.910
of transportation alternative
power trains for cars,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.910
and they conclude that electric
vehicles are much worse--

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.220
not much worse--
worse environmentally

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.300
than diesel, which, in turn, is
worse than gasoline or ethanol.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.420
And the reason is, of
course, electric vehicles

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.550
across the country
are half coal-powered,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.050
because that's where the
electricity comes from.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.360
And this, sort of, gets
lost in the discussion.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.130
But there are these numbers.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.400
Where do they come from?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.910
Where do you think they
come from? $62 billion

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.620
is not peeling paint.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.890
$62 billion is mostly valuing
premature mortality, i.e.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.430
people die.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.690
There's a little bit
of health effects.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.520
People get bronchitis.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.280
But mostly, those numbers
are from people dying.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.880
How would you do that?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.880
Does it make sense to
compute numbers like that?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880
Does is it makes sense
to use numbers like that?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.520
How would you use
numbers like that?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.370
Do you believe
numbers like that?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.920
People say $62 billion
worth of damages.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.760
Putting a price on human
life, putting a price on risk,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.560
what do you think?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.450
You read that,
what's your reaction?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.130
How about a reaction?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.269
Max, you've got a reaction?

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.960
STUDENT: Probably the cost of
medical expenses associated.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.460
PROFESSOR: That be
one way to do it,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.570
but that's not usually
how they do it.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.310
See one of the--

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.400
if you do that, you can
come to the conclusion

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.980
that cigarette
smoking is terrific,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.820
because people die at a
younger age if they smoke,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.825
and therefore they don't have
the long care costs of people

00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:46.200
in their 80s or
90s, because they

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.970
don't get to their 80s or 90s.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.030
So you can measure costs of
sickness sometimes that way

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.010
but not death, not death.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.270
Anybody else?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.070
Julian?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.204
STUDENT: What would be their
contribution to the GDP

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:06.222
and their economic
contribution is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.680
PROFESSOR: That's
one way to do it.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.050
Do you like that?

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.018
You could do it that way.

00:05:12.018 --> 00:05:15.520
STUDENT: I would try and take
all their economic impact,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.490
including the health costs,
their [INAUDIBLE] of tax base,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.270
but how much they cost in taxes.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.750
PROFESSOR: So basically
retired people--

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.140
and this is beginning to
beginning to bother me--

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.320
retired people should have
a negative value, right?

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.600
Because they're drawing
down social security.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.490
They're drawing down Medicare.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.470
They're not working.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.300
Just gone.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.400
So that method has been used.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.250
It does have that
consequence I just described.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.530
But for working age people--

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.700
and sometimes that's
done in court cases.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.160
So someone is killed by
negligence and you sue.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.250
And what do you get?

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.200
Well, one way that
sometimes calculated

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.980
is, well, how much money would--

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.730
the wife sues.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.560
The husband was killed at work.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.850
The wife gets the husband's
expected lifetime earnings.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.130
That isn't what they do
here because a lot of this

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.850
is mortality of
older people, and you

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.160
don't want to come up
with a negative number.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.690
The way they do it--

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.150
because it's a little
bit of a little bit

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.654
of a puzzle-- the way they
do it is they look at,

00:06:34.654 --> 00:06:43.800
at least recently, you look at
weight premiums for risky jobs.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.920
So you say, how
much more does it

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.880
take to persuade somebody to
be a welder underwater, which

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.290
is a bit hazardous than
they'd be a welder on land.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.400
And a number of
calculations like that.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.870
Because you're not actually
valuing a death when you do

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.590
these studies.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.290
You're valuing an
increase in risk.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.310
So you increase
the risk of death.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.310
And you say, all right,
well, in the marketplace,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.840
what are people willing--

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.340
what does it
require, what do you

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.370
have to pay people to get them
to assume an increased risk

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.340
of death in certain settings?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.090
And then you play with that for
a while, make some assumptions,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.910
roll it around, and say the
value of a premature death

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.140
$6 million, which is a
round number that's used.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.590
And then you say, OK.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.020
We look at how many
people we expect

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.560
will die early because
of small particulates

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.140
from coal-fired power plants.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.470
And we value that at
$6 million apiece.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.530
So you're not valuing a death
so much as you're valuing

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.610
an increased risk of death.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.870
So that's how you do it.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.670
Should you use numbers like
that to make decisions?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.430
There were some readings
on whether cost benefit

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.660
analysis is ethical.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.090
And some of it comes to that.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.040
STUDENT: The person [INAUDIBLE]
not really [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.770
I wouldn't place to much
attention on the very specific,

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.120
value, per se.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.540
Maybe it would be--
for me, at least--

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:29.060
it would be like relatively-- so
the same basic assumptions made

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.270
for any different source,
maybe coal or natural gas.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.590
Maybe we see these
values relative.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.010
So it's much higher for coal
than for natural gas, just

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.520
given the case between the two.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.570
But I wouldn't do a whole
analysis saying, OK, $6 million

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.430
here and $6 million there.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.320
They could get cancer,
to OK, I mean--

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.330
PROFESSOR: But you
got to know something

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.300
about not just
relative, but absolute,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.250
to know whether it matters.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.840
If I told you the damages were
$5 from coal-fired power plants

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.380
and $0.35 from gas-fired, that
wouldn't affect any decisions.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:12.050
If I told you it was $500
billion versus $200 million,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.190
that would drive a decision.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.660
So I take your point,
but sometimes you've

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.593
got to have a sense
of the absolute,

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:20.510
not just the relative.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.985
STUDENT: May I ask--

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:22.860
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.510
STUDENT: --is there any
sense at least of error,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.290
or a band number of these--

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.180
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.960
I mean, all this stuff
is subject to error.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.300
Take coal fired-power plants.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.920
Take a particular plant.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.870
First thing you're doing
is you're estimating where

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.330
the stuff from that plant goes.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.930
OK, so that's a transport
model of one kind or another,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.400
which is averaging over a
bunch of weather conditions.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.780
And then you're using--

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.060
and there's error there, because
you can't measure that well--

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.990
and then you're using a
dose response curve based

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.780
on a number of different
kinds of studies

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.380
to say, if this
area gets this kind

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.682
of particulate concentration
over this period of time-- oh,

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:21.140
by the way, how much time do
people spend outside breathing

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.480
it versus inside?

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.130
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.970
Then we would expect this
increase in the risk of death

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.640
for people in this age bracket.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.520
Sure, there are error bars.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.510
You don't see them, but there
are pretty good size error

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.150
bars.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.690
In fact, critics say they're
very wide error bars.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.460
And similarly, the
human life, even

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:50.060
the people who do
this stuff, you're

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:56.670
comparing a risk voluntarily
assumed with a risk imposed.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.680
How many of you
ride motorcycles?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.590
How many of you ridden
on a motorcycle?

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.090
This is a risky activity.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.820
This increased your probability
of death significantly.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.650
You didn't think about it.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.240
If I told you,
however, we were going

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.690
to pump poisonous gas into your
room that had the same effect,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.670
you'd go crazy.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.610
People distinguish between
risks they choose to assume

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.900
and risks that are imposed.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.970
And I don't know
how to value that.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.290
So you had a comment?

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.070
Yeah.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.320
STUDENT: I think this is
useful for bringing attention

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.700
to an issue, rather than
the decision-making.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.650
Because when you
come to policymakers,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:38.375
they want a number that they
can associate with the issue.

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:39.750
PROFESSOR: Actually,
policymakers

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.410
tend to hate this
stuff because there

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.510
is this value in
human life aspect.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.254
STUDENT: But when you go
through all the different steps.

00:11:49.254 --> 00:11:51.895
You go through all the
inputs, all the assumptions.

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:53.520
They don't want to
go through all that.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.650
They want to compare numbers.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.390
PROFESSOR: Well,
we'll see in a second.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.860
Distinguish different
kinds of policymakers.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.690
But people who are
looking for votes

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.180
do not like to say a human
life is worth $6 million

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.240
or say anything that
sounds like a human life is

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.030
worth $6 million,
because it's priceless.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.620
Saying it's priceless
doesn't get you

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.520
a decision unless you can make
some other assumptions, which

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.954
they did.

00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.835
STUDENT: Well, when
they use that number,

00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:28.260
they don't publicize the
fact that it is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.430
PROFESSOR: I mean, every
presidential administration

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.220
since, depending on how you
think about it, Carter--

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.960
but certainly since Reagan--

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.570
Republicans and Democrats have
done this kind of analysis

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.070
quietly.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.970
OK, anything else?

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.470
Yes.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.887
STUDENT: I had a quick question
about the electric vehicle

00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:52.570
statistic.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:52.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.305
STUDENT: Is that based on
electric vehicles that are only

00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:56.650
run of coal-fired plants?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.730
Or is that--

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.310
PROFESSOR: Assume the average
generation mix, I think.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.450
You can go back and check.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.160
But I think that's
what it said--

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.080
that assuming the average
mix, which gets you

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.270
about half coal ballpark.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:07.810
Yeah?

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.090
STUDENT: Just to confirm,
they did not price carbon--

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.170
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.500
Not in those, they didn't.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.220
There's a discussion--
again, you can look at it--

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:21.250
of relative carbon
emissions, right?

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.780
And coal gives you about
twice per kilowatt hour

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.880
what gas gives you in
terms of carbon emissions.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.970
And they talk a little
bit about transportation.

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:34.570
Now, I guess we won't.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.112
I was going to say we will come
to some discussion of pricing

00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:38.270
carbon.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.250
The Obama administration
has an official value

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.820
for carbon emissions that it
uses for internal decisions.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.950
It sounds like a
reasonable number,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.100
but it rests on weak
foundations because--

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.440
we'll talk about
this, but trying

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.340
to understand the magnitude of
climate damages in a century

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.510
and discounting it back
is a difficult exercise.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.000
OK.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.390
Let me move along.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:17.090
I want to talk about this
property rights analysis

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.590
because I think it's
useful to think about.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.840
There are those people who
actually said that where

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.740
you really don't need this kind
of government interference.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:37.010
You could just assign property
rights to either, say,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.830
clean air or clean
water, or property

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.270
rights to dump pollution and
let the market sort it out.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.520
This is the so-called
Coase theorem.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.810
And the example that's given in
the Viscusi et cetera reading

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.070
is this one.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.318
You have a mill.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.400
You have a river.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.240
And you have a town.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.020
The mill dumps pollution
into the river.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.320
The town takes water
out of the river.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.710
There's $500 worth of damage.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.900
OK, so drinking
the polluted water

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.450
or using it to wash
clothes or whatever

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.030
causes $500 worth of damages.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.530
The mill could clean
it up for $100.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:44.000
The town could treat
the water for $300.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.880
The argument goes, there
is no problem here.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.300
We just need to assign
property rights.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:56.000
Suppose you say that the town
is entitled to clean water.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.860
The town is entitled
to clean water.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.190
The town takes legal
action against the mill.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.980
The mill spends
$100 and cleans up.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.870
Simple.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.250
Suppose the mill is
entitled to pollute.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.560
Give them the property right.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.110
Then what happens?

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.830
The town could
clean up for $300.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.500
But what would most likely
happen is they go to the mill

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.070
and say, look, we'll pay
you something over $100

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.760
to clean up.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.385
Something between $100-300.

00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:31.010
You're going to pay
them more than $300

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.385
because you could
do it yourself.

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:34.280
They're not going to
take less than $100.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.620
So there's some bargaining room.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.380
You're going to get rid
of the damages either way

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.860
because it's cheaper to get
rid of them than to bear them.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.940
And either way, what happens
is the mill cleans up.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.180
In one case, the mill pays.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.340
In the other case,
the town pays.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.293
But in both cases,
the mill cleans up,

00:16:54.293 --> 00:16:56.210
the pollution goes away,
and all you had to do

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.090
is assign property rights.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.942
So first of all, are there
questions about that?

00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.359
Does that make
that little example

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.040
makes sense in its own terms?

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.050
Yeah?

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.545
STUDENT: What does
the mill need-

00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:13.920
like, the mill is
polluting, then

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.087
they're sort of claiming
those rights anyway, right?

00:17:16.087 --> 00:17:17.329
So then--

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.420
PROFESSOR: Well, we have that
happen at the outset, and then

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.243
we and then we establish
property rights.

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.660
Then we establish
property rights.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.310
So this is the status quo
before we put the law in effect,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.240
and what the law says is instead
of yelling at each other,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.760
one of you has the
right to enforce action

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.740
against the other in court.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.030
So either the town can
force the mill to clean up

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.090
or the mill can do
whatever it wants

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.540
unless it's bribed or paid.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.540
So we start out with a situation
in which there are no property

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.620
rights.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.780
The mill is polluting,
the town is complaining.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.640
We assign property
rights, the problem

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.200
gets solved, is the argument.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.000
Either way, we assign them.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.610
STUDENT: Are property rights
necessary for the town

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.300
to clean up the water?

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.420
Because [INAUDIBLE] river
and they want water.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.090
PROFESSOR: Well, if the town--

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:20.510
I mean, you could imagine
what property rights determine

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:26.240
here is who pays, basically.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.350
Because if the-- which thing
is, if you don't have property

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.580
rights, the town's going to
go up here and try to bargain.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.560
Because you're
saying, implicitly,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.017
unless you do something,
the mill just pollutes.

00:18:40.017 --> 00:18:42.350
Well, that's equivalent to
saying the mill has the right

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.150
to pollute.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.210
If the mill has the
right to pollute,

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.240
then the town is going to
have to pay them not to.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.540
If the town has the
right to clean water,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.910
then the mill is either going
to have to clean up or pay

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.110
the town to clean up.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.640
It's cheaper for the mill.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.600
The mill cleans up.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.120
So if you say the mill
is just going to pollute,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.610
not if the town can stop it.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.500
Not if the town can stop it.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.030
That comes to the next
question, is why won't it work?

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.050
One way one reason it might
not work in a real life case

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.430
is the town doesn't
happen to have chemists

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.070
and doesn't realize
that the water is dirty.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.590
So you might want to say,
gee, a role of government

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.440
is to do some science
here, at least,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.060
and figure out what's going on
to do the studies of damages.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.860
And I want to make
sure everybody's

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.902
got the example before
we go to run down

00:19:41.902 --> 00:19:42.860
this list a little bit.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.020
But are you on the example?

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.550
Or are you on why
it might not work?

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.610
STUDENT: I'm on the
example I was wondering,

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.270
how do you decide who
gets the property right?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.630
PROFESSOR: Coase's point
is it doesn't matter.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.210
I mean, it matters from the
point of view of fairness,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.290
maybe.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.820
You might say it's fair
to have the polluter pay.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.660
But Coase's point of view is
you clean it up either way.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.480
His example was,
in fact, a train.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.820
And this was a
coal-fired steam engine

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.430
running by a farmer's field.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.320
Sparks come out of
the smokestacks.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.960
Sparks start fires.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.810
The farmer can put out
the fires or the railroad

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.942
can clean up the smokestack.

00:20:29.942 --> 00:20:31.400
Whoever has the
property rights are

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.030
going to get the lower-cost
alternative done.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.120
STUDENT: One thing
with that scenario

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.890
or with the mill scenario,
even if the mill had property

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.740
rights, then wouldn't
the town want

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.820
to bribe them either
way, whether or not

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.070
they have the property rights?

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.862
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:20:49.862 --> 00:20:53.570
Well, if the town
has property rights,

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.800
it doesn't have to bribe.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.430
It can compel.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.420
It'll bribe if it
has no alternative.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.420
That is to say, if the mill
has the right to pollute,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.470
then it'll have to bribe.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.610
If the town has the
right, it can sue.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.780
It can compel.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.290
Yeah?

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.210
STUDENT: Also assuming
the cost of damages

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.100
is greater than the--

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.085
the $500 is greater than the
$300, which may be true--

00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:23.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it could--

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:30.140
if I make this 50,
then nobody cleans up.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.670
That's $50 worth of damages,
then the mill has the right.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.710
The town isn't going
to spend $100 or more

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.800
to save itself $50
worth of damages.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:49.045
And if the town has
the right, well, that's

00:21:49.045 --> 00:21:50.420
actually an
interesting question.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:22:01.460
If the town has the right to
clean water, in that case,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.010
would it compel the
mill to clean up?

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.040
I think you get the bargain
going the other way.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.240
You get the bargain going.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.370
You've got the right
to clean water.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.330
The mill pays them $60
to accept the damages.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.720
The mill covers the
cost of the damages

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.470
because the efficient
thing, in this case,

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.380
is not to clean up,
assuming this is

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.780
a number that makes some sense.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.110
OK.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.250
Anything else on this?

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.180
OK, why do we need EPA?

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.560
Why don't we just do this?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.990
One answer is, gee, there's
an information problem

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.550
in a lot of these areas.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.390
So maybe a role of government
is to do the science,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.370
tell people about it,
make sure the town knows,

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.080
make sure the mill knows.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.390
Maybe even work on
clean-up technologies.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.030
All perfectly sensible things.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.670
And then assign
property rights, right?

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.697
Yeah?

00:22:57.697 --> 00:22:59.280
STUDENT: It's really
complicated, say,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.710
if you had five miles
ahead of the town

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.990
and they're all
polluting, and then you

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.790
have the case
where one mill says

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.690
it pollutes less so it
should have to clean up less.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.960
And then it's just a huge
argument over monetary value.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.700
PROFESSOR: And let's
suppose we have six towns.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.950
OK, so you can have--

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.190
so let me just
write a little bit.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.800
The first thing we talked about
that made the cameras move.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.800
The first thing we talked
about was information.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.715
And the second point here
is number of players.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.750
There's just a whole lot that
comes under that heading.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.360
If you think about applying
it to air pollution,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.410
so there's a coal-fired power
plant in Salem, Massachusetts.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.770
The coal-fired power plant in
Salem, Massachusetts is dirty.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.440
Everybody in Salem
and around Salem

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.910
gets affected, to some extent.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.450
How does this work?

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.610
I give every person
property rights?

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:07.680
And how do 20,000, 30,000
people act collectively?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.540
Sue in court.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.910
So when you have more than
these simple examples,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:17.510
it gets to be hard.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.980
And the other one,
just to fill it out,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.525
is just transaction costs.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.620
In a world in which everybody
is suing everybody else one way

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.190
or another and bargaining
over cleanup costs,

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.210
that's a world in which a lot
of money is spent doing that.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.420
So the usual argument
here is, well, this

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.930
is a lovely exercise.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.770
And it does make a
good point, I think.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.780
But frankly, when you
go to the real world,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.710
you need a different mechanism
to deal with externalities.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.670
So that's an argument for
involving the government.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.620
It's not necessarily an
argument for involving

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.900
the federal government.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.745
Before 1970, most states
had environmental agencies.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.910
Why do we need a federal agency?

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.560
This is a cue for
all the Republicans.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.470
Go ahead.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.660
STUDENT: The president decides
that it's OK to pollute a lot.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.160
That could be in the atmosphere
and affect the states

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.670
that border.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.520
PROFESSOR: So pollution
across state lines.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.777
Absolutely.

00:25:36.777 --> 00:25:38.110
Anything else cross state lines?

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.920
David?

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.587
STUDENT: I was just going to say
it crosses national lines, too.

00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:45.690
PROFESSOR: We'll see-- when we
talk about acid rain-- we'll

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.900
see that that pollution
crossing the Canadian border

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.218
turned out to have an
important implication.

00:25:51.218 --> 00:25:53.760
It does cross national lines,
but since we don't have a world

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.340
government, having a
world pollution agency

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.450
is not an option, although there
are international agreements.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.510
The Montreal
Protocol that phased

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.110
out ozone-depleting chemicals
was an example of exactly that.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.590
People got together to
solve a global problem.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.700
Climate change is harder.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.475
Brendan?

00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:13.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.113
PROFESSOR: Electricity
crosses state lines,

00:26:16.113 --> 00:26:17.530
so what you're
saying is you could

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.140
generate in some
place that's dirty

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.960
and sell to someplace
that's clean

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.770
and disadvantage the entities
in the collinear state.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.850
Anything else?

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.823
Ryan?

00:26:28.823 --> 00:26:30.740
STUDENT: Well, there's
not only air pollution.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.220
There's also river pollution,
including the Mississippi

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:33.850
River.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.470
But also, if you--

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.300
I don't know if it's the case--

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.380
but if you mine in one state and
it gets dirty from the mining,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.270
and you sell it to
a different state,

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.670
there's like some sort
of transaction there.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.620
PROFESSOR: And there's
a transaction there?

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.490
Anything else you
might worry about--

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.190
if you're a clean state
that you might worry about?

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.422
Yeah, Max.

00:26:55.422 --> 00:26:57.130
STUDENT: I mean, it's
the economic thing.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.460
So if one state decides that
they're going to deregulate

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.428
and allow pollution to go
[INAUDIBLE] tax reductions

00:27:03.428 --> 00:27:05.470
in states that are cleaning
the economically poor

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.290
because corporations--

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:12.190
PROFESSOR: The that
everybody has is jobs--

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:16.180
is that you'll
basically be Mississippi

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.150
decides that it
really needs jobs.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.370
It's a low-income,
low-wage state.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.360
So apart from being
tough on labor unions,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.120
it's also going to be
real easy on pollution.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.675
And everybody in
Mississippi says,

00:27:29.675 --> 00:27:31.300
well, I don't like
to breathe that air,

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.810
but I'd like to have a job.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.013
You have a race to the
bottom, so to speak.

00:27:36.013 --> 00:27:37.180
And pollution, it's a worry.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.340
Whether it happens
or doesn't happen,

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.490
it's a worry that you really
needed some national standards

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.460
or some national something.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.250
But let me pause
and I'm just going

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.430
to pose a question that we
we'll come back to later

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:59.300
in the course, which is
how come it happened?

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.430
For all the years, people
worry about dirty air

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.180
and dirty water.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.970
This isn't a new concern.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.880
There's a very old act that
forbids discharge of anything

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.160
into the navigable waters
of the United States.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.310
It's been ignored since it was
written in the 19th century,

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:24.840
but pollution wasn't
discovered in 1970.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.720
A Republican president signed
the Clean Air Act amendments

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.790
and created EPA in 1970.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.430
And there's a historical
answer to the events

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.750
that led up to it.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.140
But I'd like you to think about
the fundamental question-- is

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.210
what turned the politics from
absolutely nothing going on

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.260
at the federal level to a new
agency with strong mandates.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.440
Don't answer that question.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.400
We're going to do it later.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.780
You're going to say Earth Day.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.790
And I'm going to
say that's right.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.700
And then we're going to say,
where did Earth Day come from?

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.290
So we've got EPA.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:10.730
But as the case says, I
mean, this comes down to,

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.140
do policymakers like numbers?

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.480
What the law said-- these
are the National Ambient Air

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.350
Quality Standards.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:22.740
So one of EPA'S jobs
is to say, how clean

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.320
must the air be everywhere
in the United States?

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.850
And you could imagine doing
that in two different ways.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.870
You could imagine doing those
kinds of damage numbers,

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:38.680
damages at different
levels of air quality,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.080
and look at the costs of
obtaining different levels

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.240
of air quality.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.570
Do the maximize
benefits minus cost.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.490
What the law told
EPA to do, however,

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.170
was to protect human health with
an adequate margin of safety.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.220
Why do you think they did that
as opposed to good old cost

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.590
benefit analysis, which every
economist would tell them

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.507
they should have done?

00:30:03.507 --> 00:30:05.920
And that law has been
in effect since 1970

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.800
with every economist saying
that doesn't make any sense.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.230
Take a guess.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.090
Somebody who hasn't spoken yet.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.000
Rachel, what do you think?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.750
STUDENT: Politics.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.583
PROFESSOR: Politics.

00:30:21.583 --> 00:30:23.328
But what kind of politics?

00:30:23.328 --> 00:30:25.962
STUDENT: In the sense
that the president is

00:30:25.962 --> 00:30:28.880
creating this agency that
could be in charge of this.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.363
It might be related to
the cost benefit analysis.

00:30:33.363 --> 00:30:35.030
PROFESSOR: But he has
to do an analysis.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.670
He has to protect human
health with an adequate margin

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.690
of safety.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.970
And that analysis
will be challenged.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.560
It'll be challenged by industry.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.630
It'll be challenged by
the environmentalists.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.430
So you don't just
make up the numbers.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.760
You have to show that you're
protecting human health

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.980
and you have to put in an
adequate margin of safety.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.230
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] the EPA--

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.313
I forget the exact number.

00:30:55.313 --> 00:30:59.290
It's like one in every
10,000 different risk factors

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.290
depending on what it is.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.502
But that sounds like, oh, only
one out of every 100,000 people

00:31:03.502 --> 00:31:06.920
is going to get cancer, versus
we're saying you getting cancer

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.352
is worth X amount of costs.

00:31:09.352 --> 00:31:10.810
PROFESSOR: I think
it's the optics.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.880
I think that's right.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.020
This assumes that there is some
level below which you're safe

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.940
and above which you're not safe.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.430
And if we just get
away get a little bit

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.660
below that low level,
we're all safe.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.180
The evidence, as far as I
know, on all these pollutants

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.610
is it smooth.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.030
There is no threshold.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.880
The law presumes the threshold
because that's easier

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.020
to talk about.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.330
And then, internally,
you can say, well,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.730
we'll use a one in a million
or one in 10 million,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.750
or something like that.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.920
And then you can say we're
protecting human health.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.010
You don't have to stand up
and say, valuing a human life

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.010
at $6 million, dot, dot, dot.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.790
It is the optics.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:56.070
And I think everybody
who's thought about this

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.920
understands that-- that this
is an illogical criteria.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.970
It means as you get better and
better at measuring things,

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.420
you have to set tighter and
tighter standards because you

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.410
detect human health effects at
lower and lower concentrations,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.380
which is not
necessarily a bad thing,

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.280
but it's kind of inevitable
and kind of artificial.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.440
Why not just use a price?

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.290
So why not, instead
of setting standards--

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:26.520
this is an example from the
graph from the reading--

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.720
suppose that-- and it deals
with a very simple case.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.690
Suppose that here
is the marginal cost

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:40.480
of producing gasoline, let us
say, and there's the demand.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:46.950
So this would be the
equilibrium with no regulation.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.930
And Viscusi says,
well, suppose we

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:54.600
know the damages per
gallon of gasoline produced

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.130
is given by the distance
between these two curves.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.390
So we tax the
production of gasoline.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.370
Again, a simple model.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.860
We suppose that's the problem.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.550
We put a tax equal
to this amount here,

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.910
then the equilibrium
is at the point where

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.020
production cost plus the
marginal value of damages

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.880
equals the market price.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.580
You don't want to produce
less because the total cost

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.610
production plus damages
is less than the amount

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.320
the market's willing to pay.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.740
You don't want to produce
more because the total cost

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.920
on the margin, the total
cost for additional units,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.220
exceeds what the
market's willing to pay.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.615
So you impose the marginal
cost of damages as a price.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.170
Everything is swell.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.290
Economists are happy.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.660
And you used the price system.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.360
Why might you not
want to do that?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.770
Well, maybe you do.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.950
Why would that be hard?

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.950
Let me just start there.

00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:07.675
Part of the reason you
don't do it is the optics.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.110
Again, you'd rather say we're
protecting human health than

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.360
we're imposing a marginal tax
of $0.60 a gallon to reflect

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.739
environmental the value
of human life lost.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.230
That's not a great headline.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.469
But suppose you could
find a way to disguise it.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.489
Suppose you just do it.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:29.989
This is the charge.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:30.860
Yeah?

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.652
STUDENT: Well, if you're
going to tax, say,

00:34:32.652 --> 00:34:37.550
coal, more than you would tax
oil for having high damages,

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.679
there's also reasons to
tax oil more than coal

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.739
because oil's imported
and coal is domestic.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.415
So how do you--

00:34:45.415 --> 00:34:47.040
PROFESSOR: We'll do
all the arithmetic.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.750
We'll figure out
the marginal value

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.850
of reduced energy security.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.840
We'll figure out the marginal
value of CO2 emissions.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.550
And we'll figure out
the marginal value

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.490
of-- marginal cost, rather--
of a little bitty particulates

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.005
that get in your
lung and kill you.

00:35:01.005 --> 00:35:03.505
And we'll just add them up.

00:35:03.505 --> 00:35:05.130
STUDENT: And then
you're really getting

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.540
into the optics of
showing how much you're

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.290
valuing a human life in
comparison to things like--

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.710
PROFESSOR: Even if
you could-- well,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.350
I mean, economists
all love this.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.050
You do have the optics problem.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.000
The other problem you
got to is that's hard.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.620
That's hard, right?

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.980
Because you saw that range of
damages for coal-fired power

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.070
plants because that
reflects where they are.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.910
So you'd want to
do this calculation

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.330
at least for every
coal-fired power plant.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:45.680
Every gas-fired power plant,
and oh, by the way, every car.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.800
Because the damages depend on
where you drive and how far

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.300
you drive.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.760
So you'd want to have
taxes for everything.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.650
Now, as an economist, that's
little short of paradise.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.910
But as a practical matter,
that's really hard.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.910
That's really hard.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.210
So what you get instead--

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.750
there are prices, occasionally--
we'll talk about some systems

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.810
that are price-driven--

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.900
where it's easier.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.630
Suppose you're
worried about climate.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.230
Well, to a first approximation,
carbon dioxide goes in the air.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.880
Carbon dioxide mixes globally.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.470
You don't care
where it comes from.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:28.950
You could have a single
price for carbon dioxide.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.250
Mercury from coal-fired
power plants, the damages

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.615
depend on where the plant is.

00:36:34.615 --> 00:36:36.240
So if you're going
to do prices, you're

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.370
going to have to do
different prices.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.440
That's hard.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.185
Sometimes it's not
quite right that it

00:36:44.185 --> 00:36:46.560
doesn't matter where it comes
from but it's close enough.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.414
David?

00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:50.880
STUDENT: It's only really hard
if you want to do it right.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.640
So what the EPA
does now where you

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.180
said they said some standard
of like, how much pollution you

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.970
can put out, but they just kind
of hit the limit arbitrarily.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.830
PROFESSOR: And then--
well, they do two things.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.280
They do two things that
the case talks about.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.530
They do other things, as well.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.710
But the two things the
case talks about is they

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.570
set air quality standards.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.060
And they say everywhere
in the country

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.940
the air has to meet
these certain standards.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.090
Well, you could say,
gee, it makes sense

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.950
to let the air be
dirty in Los Angeles

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.995
because it's really hard
to clean it in Los Angeles.

00:37:24.995 --> 00:37:26.870
You can argue about
whether that makes sense.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.900
But they don't do that.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.710
The other thing they do
is they set standards

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.130
and they let the states
figure out how to do that.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.660
Look, Ohio's got to be clean.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.160
Illinois has got to be clean.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.810
Figure out what to do.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.640
If you can find a
way to minimize cost,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.220
even if you want to
price stuff to do it.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.590
You, the states, figure
out how to do it.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.240
We'll check your plan to
see if it's going to work,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.510
but you give us a plan.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.460
That's not terrible.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.930
Not great, but
it's not terrible.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.790
Then the other thing they do--

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.500
that the case
mentions-- is they set

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.810
standards for new power plants.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.410
And those are the
same everywhere.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:09.060
And you can argue, yes, no,
is that the right thing to do?

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.790
But it's better than
you tell me where

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.450
you're going to put the
plant, I'll calculate the tax.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.250
Because that's hard.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.120
A lot of what goes
on here is you

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.740
have two imperfect approaches.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.140
And I'm just saying that
while this is really

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.690
a textbook ideal, it's hard.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.510
And while what EPA
actually does isn't

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:35.300
very good from a textbook point
of view, it sort of works--

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.860
particularly, the air standards.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.080
A lot of us would
say, look, Los Angeles

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.200
is really hard to clean up.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.310
Let them be dirty.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.827
And of course,
that's practically

00:38:47.827 --> 00:38:49.910
what happens because it's
been impossible to clean

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.860
LA to meet national standards.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.172
But at least the principle
is if you move to LA,

00:38:56.172 --> 00:38:57.380
you're entitled to clean air.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.060
So nobody's doing it perfectly.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.830
The question is, which
of the imperfect methods

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.590
is A, workable
and B, reasonable?

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.600
And all I'm saying
is that you don't

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.330
want to get caught up
in the beauty of this

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.430
without thinking about the
complexity of doing it.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.110
Really, you could
say, all right.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.960
If I'm concerned about
acid rain in the east,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.660
then I will make I
will act as if it

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.140
doesn't matter where sulfur
dioxide goes up into the air.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.840
Does it matter?

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.665
Yes, it matters.

00:39:33.665 --> 00:39:34.540
Does it matter a lot?

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.050
Well, not so much
within certain bounds.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.452
So yeah, It's not quite right.

00:39:39.452 --> 00:39:40.660
But I'll use that assumption.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.815
It'll let me do something
I couldn't do otherwise.

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:47.490
STUDENT: Does it matter
who the rain is falling on?

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.430
PROFESSOR: Well, it does matter
who the rain is falling on.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.960
Let's hold this for
about four weeks.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.710
And then I want to go
into that in detail.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.087
Yeah, in the back.

00:39:57.087 --> 00:39:58.170
STUDENT: I had a question.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.050
How do you handle
[INAUDIBLE] factors?

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.000
Something that jumps
to my mind is farming.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.520
You use pesticides,
or ammonia fertilizers

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.530
that get into the water.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.750
And not using those
reduces food production.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.890
What do if you have increased
environmental risk of dying?

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.990
On the other side, you
also have increased

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.340
risk of more expensive food,
or not enough food, or things

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.830
like that.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.080
PROFESSOR: Well, actually,
that's a little off track.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.250
That turns out to be hard.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.160
We control-- this is not, of
course, about water pollution.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.910
And I don't want to
spend much time on it.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.520
But we control point sources.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.008
So if you have that mill
over there, EPA will limit,

00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:41.050
or the state will limit--

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.810
I'm not sure how that works--

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.560
what you can put in the water.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.240
If you have a form that's
called nonpoint source.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.970
You get runoff.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.960
You could imagine, in theory,
doing cost benefit calculations

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.790
about comparing increases
in food production costs

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.420
with ecosystem damage--

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.030
which is largely
what you're getting,

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.580
you're getting phosphates and
other nutrients in the water

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.800
that damage
ecosystems and such--

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.100
as well as increased
cleanup costs downstream.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.920
And that might tell you
what level of fertilizer use

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.410
is optimal or with certain
products should and shouldn't

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.510
be used.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.630
Enforcement is a little tough.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.840
So we really don't control
nonpoint source water pollution

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.080
very well in this country.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.140
And I was involved in
discussions in Washington 20

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.780
years ago now about, can we
think about how to do this?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.585
And it's just a head-scratcher.

00:41:37.585 --> 00:41:39.710
Because you really don't
want the black helicopters

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.010
over every farm, but you
know what's the alternative?

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.380
So let me move along here.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.380
So we've talked about a
number of these things.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.840
Oh, one of the other things--

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.680
let me just go to the next.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.535
So this is EPA.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.530
It's November 1974.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.727
What just happened?

00:42:02.727 --> 00:42:04.560
Why do we all of a
sudden care about energy?

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.870
Scott?

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:07.512
You are Scott.

00:42:07.512 --> 00:42:08.220
You're not Scott.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.345
You don't have a name card.

00:42:09.345 --> 00:42:10.710
He's Scott.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.168
Who are you pretending
to be today?

00:42:12.168 --> 00:42:12.752
STUDENT: Sean.

00:42:12.752 --> 00:42:13.600
PROFESSOR: Sean, OK.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.480
STUDENT: Oil prices?

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.100
PROFESSOR: Oil prices.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.270
What did they do?

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.680
STUDENT: Embargo.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.220
OPEC.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.750
PROFESSOR: OPEC
imposed an embargo.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.580
It didn't keep oil
from getting to us,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.890
but the prices went way up.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:31.270
So Nixon, all of a
sudden we talk about,

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:33.720
we're very threatened.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.730
The Arab countries
wouldn't ship to us.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:36.840
We got oil.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.000
It doesn't matter oil.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.020
Tankers go to sea.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.330
The tankers go where
the tankers go.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.290
People buy them at
sea and redirect them.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.120
So we got oil.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:52.690
But Nixon says we need to
be independent by 1980.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:58.030
So first question is, what does
energy independence do for you?

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.720
And is energy independence the
same thing as energy security?

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.370
And how is this how important
is it, if it's important?

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.070
Reactions?

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.450
Was that the right goal?

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.550
Was that a right goal?

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.670
Forget the fact that
we failed miserably.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.860
Was that worth
spending money on?

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.930
A lot of money?

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.980
And if so, why?

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.330
And if not, why not?

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:29.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] any energy
sources from other countries,

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.690
but at the same
time, a global energy

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.565
crisis happened in the
world, you would still

00:43:33.565 --> 00:43:36.160
be affected because
you're only independent,

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.220
but other products that you are
importing from other countries

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.250
still depends on
the energy crisis.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.100
PROFESSOR: Well, did
everybody get that?

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.280
The argument is that if there
is a major energy crisis,

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.240
even if we're not importing
any oil, which is what matters,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.200
will be affected.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.605
You're saying will be affected
because we will import things

00:43:56.605 --> 00:43:57.980
from countries
that are affected.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.813
Import other things.

00:43:58.813 --> 00:44:04.190
We'll also export to countries
that may have trouble buying.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:09.050
But also I mean, you saw the
diagrams for Western Europe.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.020
These are long-term allies.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.780
Our policy will be
affected if suddenly--

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.590
suppose Russia turns
off the gas pipeline.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.070
Do we just say to our
European friends and allies,

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.080
buy some wool socks.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.280
It's going to get cold.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.390
No.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.010
Our policy is affected.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.580
So one argument is even if
you're energy independent,

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.290
you don't live behind a wall.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.740
Any other thoughts?

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.265
Just agree, disagree.

00:44:40.265 --> 00:44:43.410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] is in
coal, so we don't necessarily

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.090
want to be running
independently on coal

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.270
because it pollutes more.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.730
PROFESSOR: OK, so it matters
how you become independent.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.130
OK.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:53.887
Good point.

00:44:53.887 --> 00:44:54.720
There's a trade off.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.490
There may be a trade off.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.830
If you have nice, cheap
natural gas, maybe not so much.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:44:59.873
But, yeah?

00:44:59.873 --> 00:45:01.290
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
consideration

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.790
for energy security.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.270
We decide to become energy
independent by relying

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.747
on nuclear, and that makes
us vulnerable to an attack

00:45:08.747 --> 00:45:10.080
on a nuclear plant, for example.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.990
PROFESSOR: Security has
multiple dimensions.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.520
So you might be vulnerable
to terrorist attacks

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.800
on nuclear plants the way
you wouldn't necessarily

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.450
be vulnerable if say
you're getting oil

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.100
from Canada by pipeline.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.980
Also may depend who you're
getting your energy from.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.520
Yeah?

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.270
Max?

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.200
I'll go back.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.575
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
security, looking at that,

00:45:28.575 --> 00:45:30.600
I've always though
energy independence

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.880
doesn't necessarily imply
security implications

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.370
as a matter of
national interest.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.530
We're the largest importer
of oil in the world.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.780
We stop importing oil from
countries like Saudi Arabia

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.363
and other countries
in the Middle East

00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:43.700
and they might not be
so happy to help Assad

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.640
if Israel goes south.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.650
PROFESSOR: That's an
interesting hypothetical.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.150
Yeah?

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.110
Good point, though.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:52.690
Good point.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.710
There's a lot of
other connections.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.550
I can't read it.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.790
Could be James.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.030
OK.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.760
STUDENT: If it costs too much
to be energy independent,

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.220
it probably will
hurt the economy.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.510
PROFESSOR: Could be
too expensive to do.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:12.130
OK, actually, let me give you
let me give you two scenarios.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.730
One, all of our oil is--

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.970
we have the same total
energy use that we have now.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.950
All of our oil is imported.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.800
We import five barrels a day.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.760
The other case is we're
energy independent.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.360
We use twice as much
oil as we do today.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.710
So one case, we have no imports.

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.670
The other case, we
have all imports.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.105
In which case are
we more secure?

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.240
Which case are we
less vulnerable?

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.360
Let me put it that way.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.800
Lots of oil, all domestic,
versus a little bit of oil,

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.000
all imported.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.040
What are the risks?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.520
What are the risks
you worry about?

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.230
Yeah?

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.365
STUDENT: If you import, I
guess there's multiple sources

00:47:03.365 --> 00:47:04.240
and more negotiation.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.950
Whereas if you're all
self-sufficient, in a sense,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.450
if something were
to go wrong, you'd

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.242
have nowhere to go with it.

00:47:12.242 --> 00:47:13.700
PROFESSOR: Well,
I didn't say there

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.050
was nobody else in the world.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.830
I just said all of
our oil is domestic.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.120
There are still tankers.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.440
There are still ports.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.770
There's still the world market.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.361
Manuel?

00:47:26.361 --> 00:47:28.030
STUDENT: If all the
oil is domestic,

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.120
we might run out in
the next few years.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.410
PROFESSOR: Right let's
assume we got lucky.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:34.820
We got so we got lucky.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.800
We have a lot of it.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.645
Jake?

00:47:36.645 --> 00:47:38.580
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
much more expensive.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.730
It's kind of like the same
as you have in sugar--

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.980
PROFESSOR: All right, let
me make a nice hypothetical.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.950
Same cost.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.690
We're producing world prices.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.870
Let me lead you in the
direction I want to go.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.470
Suppose the world price doubles.

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.380
In which scenario do
we get hurt worse?

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.538
A little bit of oil all
imported, a lot of oil

00:47:57.538 --> 00:47:58.080
all domestic?

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.590
STUDENT: I guess if world
prices were doubled,

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.970
we'd be hurt less
if all our oil--

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:10.000
PROFESSOR: Oh, so you
would separate our prices

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.560
from the world price?

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.600
Oh, I didn't say
it was separate.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.600
I just said we produced it all.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.020
Britain was self-sufficient
in oil for a long time.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.200
STUDENT: We would export it.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.780
So I guess we might--

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.140
PROFESSOR: What would happen--

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.930
STUDENT: We would export oil
because we'd make more money.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.790
PROFESSOR: Straight.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.220
So wouldn't you expect
the domestic price

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.930
to equal the world
price in both cases?

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:33.680
STUDENT: Yes.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.520
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.470
So we use a lot of oil.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.330
The price doubles.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:42.470
Versus a little bit of
oil and the price doubles.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.580
STUDENT: Using less oil.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.205
PROFESSOR: Using less
oil would make us

00:48:45.205 --> 00:48:48.210
less vulnerable to that shock.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:55.970
So the amount of oil matters
as much as where it comes from.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.610
The difference is, do the
checks go to Saudi Arabia

00:48:58.610 --> 00:48:59.990
or do they go to Texas?

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:01.560
Or now North Dakota.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.320
But if you drive a car it
doesn't much matter to you.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.420
It's still a doubling
of your cost.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:06.920
Yeah?

00:49:09.338 --> 00:49:11.630
STUDENT: During the crisis,
I think it became important

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.760
not only for strategic,
political reasons,

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.180
but also because the public
perception changed completely

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.740
because Americans never really
had faced an overall energy

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.520
crisis.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.930
It's not just about price.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.330
People would go to
the gas stations

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.300
and they couldn't get gas.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.990
So there was actually a supply--

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.780
PROFESSOR: Well,
that was in '79.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.860
And that's actually-- because I
was actually taking a long road

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.000
trip during that.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.720
And that was in fact, because
of government regulation.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.600
We decided we'd hold
the domestic price down

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.420
and that made it
hard to get gas.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.747
People panicked.

00:49:48.747 --> 00:49:49.580
But let me hold off.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.420
We'll come to later.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.720
So I'm going to
answer this one just

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.000
in the interest of moving along.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.620
Project Independence.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:02.480
Independence is a nice-sounding
goal, but it's not necessarily,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.320
if you think it through-- and
there's a nice recommended

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.380
piece on the list about this--

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.410
not necessarily the
most important goal.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.140
You might want to use less
oil, period, since oil

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.680
is what oil is very volatile.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.865
OK, it's '75.

00:50:21.865 --> 00:50:23.990
I'll answer this, too,
because we're moving slowly.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.490
Oil prices have
been pretty stable

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.180
since it's only been a year.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.080
Here is the choice.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:34.960
CAFE standards on cars
or a gasoline tax?

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.580
Which do you do?

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.420
Which do you do?

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.570
You're on President Ford's
council of economic advisors.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.690
In fact, one of my teachers
was on President Ford's council

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.740
of economic advisors.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.740
Which do you think he
advised Ford to support?

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.940
Standards for motor vehicles
or taxes on gasoline?

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.100
And why?

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.690
Which would you
support, and why?

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.640
STUDENT: He probably supported
standards of regulation

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.940
because taxes are fairly
unpopular and I understand

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:04.700
it's--

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.200
PROFESSOR: So the
political argument

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.440
would be can't say tax or
somebody will shoot you.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.423
Put that aside for
a moment and we'll

00:51:13.423 --> 00:51:15.590
assume you could actually
say the word tax out loud.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.590
There was a time when you
could in this country.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:18.232
Yeah?

00:51:18.232 --> 00:51:20.190
STUDENT: If you opposed
the tax, then everybody

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.130
has to pay equally and
there is no incentive

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.585
to buy [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.920
PROFESSOR: Well, the
more expensive gasoline

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:38.100
is the more expensive a gas
guzzler is for you to own.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.780
So you'd expect gasoline prices
to change vehicle purchases,

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.890
right?

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.640
So it doesn't remove
the incentive for me

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.650
to decide what to buy.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:54.540
From General Motors'
point of view, sure.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.760
If you buy a guzzler,
I'll make a guzzler.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.700
The tax would work
through consumers.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.990
Andreas?

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:04.006
STUDENT: I think it depends
on what your goal is.

00:52:04.006 --> 00:52:07.610
[INAUDIBLE] but if your
goal is to reduce pollution,

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:11.940
for example, I would think they
would make more sense to tax

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:15.550
because I would say that, in
terms of making engines more

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.930
efficient, I think the
gas price itself would

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.170
lead to more for the country.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.640
Because if gas prices
are very expensive,

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.560
you'd want to get cars that
are more efficient, like we

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.185
have with airplanes right
now and stuff like that.

00:52:28.185 --> 00:52:31.650
You would have engines more
efficient so you can use less.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.350
And I think it's fair for
an issue like pollution

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:40.890
where everybody can pay for
it as opposed to people who--

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.890
PROFESSOR: What are the
different-- good points.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.730
What are the different
effects on the cost

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.270
of driving once you own a car?

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:54.950
STUDENT: I was going to say,
with you the CAFE standards,

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:57.950
if you have a more
efficient engine,

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.800
you might be also
encouraged to drive more.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.300
PROFESSOR: Driving
is cheaper, yeah.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.710
STUDENT: It's cheaper
as opposed to like

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:04.630
taking with bus or something.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.797
PROFESSOR: I was going to
let Julian get the answer,

00:53:06.797 --> 00:53:08.810
but you probably
have another point.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.760
STUDENT: Well, I
was going to talk

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:19.080
about where the cost [INAUDIBLE]
tax or a CAFE program

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.765
to make work more [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:24.330
Because motor vehicles
are a relatively-- like,

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.790
in the last decade, you
still have to drive to work.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.163
You still have to go
to school Et cetera.

00:53:30.163 --> 00:53:31.610
Et cetera.

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.240
But if you have a
motor vehicle tax,

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.130
that would probably
pass onto something

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:41.657
like manufacturers
and they would--

00:53:41.657 --> 00:53:42.490
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:45.000
Motor fuels tax will raise the
cost of gasoline at retail.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.940
That's what it's supposed to do.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.138
Yeah.

00:53:48.138 --> 00:53:50.904
STUDENT: I mean, it
depends on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:01.090
PROFESSOR: First approximation
is it's the consumer, right?

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:02.980
If it costs more to
make efficient cars,

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.210
the consumer will pay.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.330
If gasoline prices rise,
the consumer will pay.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.090
So on that level,
it's probably a wash.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.610
The question is the
impact on incentives.

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:14.050
Let me pose you one.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.150
Suppose I have an
old gas guzzler.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.000
I have an old car that
gets lousy mileage.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.950
You do a gas tax or
you do a CAFE standard.

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:27.350
What are the impacts on
me, and what do I do?

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.100
STUDENT: Well with
the cafe standard,

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.000
your car might cost
more initially.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
PROFESSOR: No, I own it.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.080
It's an old car.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.370
It's a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:41.370
It gets twp miles to the
gallon, but the sound is good.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:43.130
OK?

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:47.510
You've imposed a CAFE
standard on 2011 model cars

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:50.240
or you've doubled the gas tax.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.060
What do I do in those two cases?

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.490
Maybe I scrap the car, right?

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.590
Maybe I scrap the car
earlier because it's

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:00.230
more expensive to
run than a new car.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.890
So I do want to cover
a little more ground.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:09.680
Most economists would say you'd
want the gas tax because it

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.050
affects driving, it
affects all drivers,

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:20.710
and ultimately, you expect it
to affect motor vehicle design

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:22.810
because you've changed
buying incentives.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:28.120
The counter is people react
slowly to price changes.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.740
You might not get the
effect you want right away.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.288
The politics are not
as good Yeah Scott?

00:55:36.288 --> 00:55:37.080
STUDENT: Excuse me.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.020
I think of the
modern day example

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.870
back in 2008 and 2009
when gas prices went up

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:47.190
to like $4 a gallon, then
people's buying preferences

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.057
did change.

00:55:48.057 --> 00:55:49.890
A lot of people started
buying smaller cars.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:54.000
More compact vehicles and SUVs
sales were really hit hard.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.210
So I think that
kind of shows that--

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.710
PROFESSOR: There
are a lot of papers

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.547
on this they come
to the conclusion

00:56:00.547 --> 00:56:02.130
that there certainly
is an effect, how

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.860
big the effective is, how
long lasting the effective is.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.770
A lot of debate.

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:09.210
But certainly in 1980
when prices spiked,

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.130
there was a big shift
to economy cars.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.870
What else might we
have done to use

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:23.910
less petroleum besides either
a gas tax or a CAFE standard?

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:25.420
Yeah.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.740
STUDENT: Carpool program.

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.260
PROFESSOR: Carpool program.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.350
Getting warm.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:31.476
Yeah?

00:56:31.476 --> 00:56:34.057
STUDENT: Improve
public transportation?

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.890
PROFESSOR: Subsidizing
public transportation

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:39.722
is sort of the European
answer to it, which

00:56:39.722 --> 00:56:41.680
is, instead of getting
the cars more efficient,

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.408
get the people out of the cars.

00:56:44.408 --> 00:56:46.450
And there was a little
bit of discussion of that,

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.600
but that's not terribly
popular, particularly

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.090
in spread-out Western cities.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:56.020
If you compare Boston,
which is fairly dense,

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.800
with a Los Angeles, or a
Denver, or a Salt Lake City,

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.190
public transportation's
tough because the cities

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.360
were built for cars.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.510
So it's a longstanding debate.

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.680
I'm going to move quickly.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.260
President Carter's
packing his bags.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.240
What's happened to oil prices?

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.682
It's late 1980.

00:57:22.682 --> 00:57:24.140
Do you remember
the hostage rescue?

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.060
You don't remember
the hostage rescue.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.180
The hostage
non-rescue in Tehran?

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:30.335
Oil prices spiked.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:39.740
So now we come to coal
because the proposal is, look,

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.750
we know how to make
liquid fuels out of coal.

00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:44.460
Germany did it in
the Second World War.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.460
People have been experimenting
with it since the 20s.

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.090
This is not magic.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.370
Processes can get better.

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:51.570
Catalysts can be improved.

00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:54.570
But basically, we know how to
make liquid fuels out of coal.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:58.890
We're sitting on a ton of coal.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:00.060
Ton understates it.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.610
We're sitting on lots of coal.

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.860
We are the Saudi Arabia of coal.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.930
Why are we fooling around here?

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:10.140
Why don't we do a synthetic
fuels industry in this country

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.630
as they did in Germany, as
they did in Japan, as they

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.550
did and are still
doing in South Africa,

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:20.100
and make liquid fuels from
coal and use American coal?

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.060
So good idea.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:28.080
And climate was not on
the table at this point.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:32.873
So climate is not a
consideration for Carter.

00:58:32.873 --> 00:58:35.290
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] process
where I remember from Germany

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.860
doing it during World War II,
it was their last ditch effort

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.130
because they were
basically isolated

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:39.940
from the rest of the world.

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.470
PROFESSOR: When they got cut
off from the Iranian oil.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:42.313
Right.

00:58:42.313 --> 00:58:44.730
STUDENT: They had to fuel their
war machine by themselves.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:46.790
So that was their only
option is to turn to--

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.450
I think they exhausted all
of those supplies, too.

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.790
PROFESSOR: Well
they made a dent.

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.270
They made a dent.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.510
So one thing you
want to think about--

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:57.400
and we talked about this--

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.080
is gee, it might be expensive.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.770
So one thing you
might want to know,

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.060
the answer to that
question is, well,

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.338
what's this stuff going
to cost per gallon?

00:59:07.338 --> 00:59:08.380
Can you give me a number?

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.300
And if it's five times the
market price, maybe not.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.750
And if it's 1 and
1/2 times the--

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.690
well, we're in 1980.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:19.000
And in 1980, oil
prices have gone up

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.170
like that and all
the forecasts called

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.860
on them to continue to rise.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.550
It's a great story of how
forecasts extrapolate.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:28.260
Every published
forecast said that they

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.610
were going to continue to rise
in the event that collapsed.

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:36.170
But in any case, you
might want to know

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.000
how the cost would compare.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.610
Anything else you might
want to think about?

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.397
Scott?

00:59:41.397 --> 00:59:43.730
STUDENT: If the synthetic
fuels industry starts off well

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:47.360
and the oil price drops,
you then lose that industry

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.980
that you invested so much in.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.550
PROFESSOR: So you might want to
think about risks, in addition

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.290
to just what it cost.

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.940
Given the history
of the oil price,

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.990
given the fact that
1980 is a peak historic,

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:04.190
maybe it's not really
going to continue to rise

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.330
as everybody says it is.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:10.130
Maybe there is just some chance
that the Iranian situation

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.398
will settle down and
prices will come back.

01:00:12.398 --> 01:00:13.940
So you'd want to
worry about the cost

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.980
and you'd want to
worry about the risk.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.090
Anything else you
might want to consider?

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.150
Yeah.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.952
STUDENT: You want to worry
about the pollution in terms

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.800
of how it relates to oil.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
where I was going.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.880
And this is in 1980.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.600
Climate is not on the table,
but local pollution, all kinds

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
of other pollution is.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.980
So you might ask the
question, what's this process

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.320
look like environmentally?

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.990
Then, of course, you would
factor in energy security.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.520
And you reach a decision.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.030
You might also ask, are these
processes really mature?

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:55.740
But in any case, you might
or might not advise--

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.703
I would say opinion was
quite mixed on this.

01:00:59.703 --> 01:01:01.620
This wasn't going to be
a government industry.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.290
This was going to be a
public-private partnership.

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:07.200
They were going to help
private industry develop, not

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.880
build a government industry.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.980
So it wasn't a nutty design.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.682
And it wasn't a nutty
idea, given all the coal.

01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:16.140
But a lot of these questions
that you raised, I don't think

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.790
were adequately
answered at the time.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.130
So now it's 1986.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.780
Reagan is president.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.700
What happened to oil prices?

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.630
I just told you.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:31.660
They collapsed.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.330
How well has the synthetic
fuels corporation performed?

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.580
Well, badly?

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.140
Matthew doing the thumbs down.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.430
OK.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:45.090
Yeah?

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:49.500
STUDENT: About 60%
of the ethanol plants

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.040
in the US close by mid-1980s.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.460
So pretty poorly.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.230
PROFESSOR: Well,
this wasn't ethanol.

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:57.180
This was-- well, some
was ethanol, actually.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.050
Yeah.

01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.990
So should we shut it down?

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.180
Yeah.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.180
You should shut it down.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.360
Shut it down.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.940
And the facts-- you'd want
to have the same facts

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.980
we had before.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.610
But here's the hypothetical
that I find intriguing.

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:21.510
Suppose oil prices collapse but
the thing that actually worked,

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.540
in the sense that the
plants were working,

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:30.160
and it costs twice as
much, but it was domestic.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.120
Would you subsidize it?

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.683
Is reduced use of petroleum
based fuels worth it?

01:02:41.683 --> 01:02:43.350
STUDENT: I would say
at that point, what

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.780
you do is you stick it in your
back pocket as like a safety

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.280
card.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.630
And also you've got
to invest in trying

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:51.270
to bring the cost down more
and increase the efficiency, so

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:54.090
in case oil prices jump
again, then you're like,

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.460
oh, we had this card
in our back pocket.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.830
PROFESSOR: So you try to
mothball the plants, basically.

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.620
Do a little do a little
R&D, mothball the plants.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.840
See if you're going
to upgrade them.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.550
Not bad.

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.367
STUDENT: I would say it
depends on the domestic impact.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:10.200
Because if you're going
with synthetic fuels

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.140
and you have like an area
the size of Texas planted

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.050
completely with sugar cane--

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.140
PROFESSOR: No, these are
coal-based, basically.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.570
So it's strip mining in Wyoming.

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.700
You know, nobody lives there.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:30.900
It's OK you don't want to
look at photos of strip mines.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.080
OK, this would actually be
a more interesting decision.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.750
You'd want to think
about employment,

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.970
by the way, if
you're a politician

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:45.380
and you just built this industry
and you said, oh gee, too bad.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.480
Oil prices collapse, you die.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.980
The political pressure to save a
government-sponsored enterprise

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.130
would be significant.

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.910
And you'd worry about the
environmental impact of running

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:58.250
it and shutting it down.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:04.880
The cost of subsidizing
down to world prices

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.180
would be the equivalent of the
cost of imports, based on this.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.690
That's a lot of money.

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:12.750
You probably wouldn't
want to do that.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.550
It's climate.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:16.870
What's happened to oil?

01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:18.340
It's 2012.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.350
Here we are.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:24.350
What's happened to
US import dependence?

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:26.720
It's gone up.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.340
What's happened
to CAFE standards?

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:31.730
Not much.

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:33.280
Yes?

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.360
Not much.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.720
The case should have
mentioned, in fact,

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.840
it a little bit
overstates the inaction.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.780
So let me correct that.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:49.930
There was a 2007 law, passed
and signed by President Bush,

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.150
that called for increases.

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.670
The Bush administration
proposed increases.

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:57.610
The Obama administration
finalized them

01:04:57.610 --> 01:04:59.590
for the next several
model years and has

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.100
agreement with manufacturers.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.260
So they're moving now.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:08.440
But from the mid 1980s until
late in the last decade,

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.290
nothing happened.

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:09.790
How come?

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.700
Rachel?

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.190
STUDENT: Well, [INAUDIBLE] for
a while and then the economy

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.683
picked up and it
started to go up,

01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:20.100
but then the economy
crashed again

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.110
And then it became
less of an issue.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:27.900
PROFESSOR: So energy
really wasn't on the table.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.120
And the auto companies were
being hammered by imports.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:31.620
And--

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.610
PROFESSOR: Other
things to worry about.

01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:39.740
It's always-- and
from the point of view

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.080
of the industry, if you
can keep it off the table,

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.700
you want it off the table.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.680
People like large, fast cars.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.010
All the R&D went
into performance.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.870
Engines got more efficient.

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:52.800
Lots more efficient.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.270
But they also got bigger.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:55.320
And cars got bigger.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.330
And we all drove SUVs, and
we're fat and happy, at least,

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.340
as I recall.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.130
What's new.

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:09.020
2012, what's the new issue?

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.820
Just one word.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:11.420
One word.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.140
OK, how about a hand?

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.580
Logan, what do you think?

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:26.330
STUDENT: Nuclear energy?

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:27.140
PROFESSOR: No, no.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:27.470
Back in the back?

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:28.216
STUDENT: Climate?

01:06:28.216 --> 01:06:29.008
PROFESSOR: Climate.

01:06:29.008 --> 01:06:30.498
Hey, there we go.

01:06:30.498 --> 01:06:30.998
Climate.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:41.150
Climate became an agenda item
in Washington in the late 1980s.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:51.960
In 1992, most of the world
ratified the UN Framework

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.165
Convention on Climate Change.

01:06:54.165 --> 01:06:56.040
I'm not going to say
something about climate.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.840
We have with us one of
the foremost climate

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.840
scientists in the world,
who is going to Kibitz.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.760
And tell me when I say something
wrong, which I probably

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.470
will in the next five minutes.

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:08.158
Professor Solomon, a recent
addition to the MIT faculty,

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.450
I am flattered that she's here.

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:11.158
And we'll see how this goes.

01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:13.200
I'm just going to say a
little bit about climate.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.540
We'll come back to it,
perhaps when she's out of town

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.710
and I can get away with more.

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:22.110
I just want to say
a little bit today.

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.470
We're going to come back to it.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.930
This is more
political background

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.030
and just one conceptual point.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:32.410
This is the hardest policy
problem I've ever encountered.

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.170
And it's hard for a
variety of reasons.

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:38.620
It's hard because
it's a global problem.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.900
It would require
significant actions

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.630
by rich and poor countries.

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.820
You saw the differences
in energy systems.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.650
All of those different
energy systems

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:51.020
would have to do something
different over the next 20

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.170
years and beyond to make a dent.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:57.890
And inconveniently, we
lack a world government.

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:01.730
So if you think it's hard to
get agreement in Congress,

01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:04.400
you can pass a law,
people can be compelled.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.410
Internationally,
you can't do it.

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:13.780
Another issue that makes it
hard is the time scales, right?

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.870
Climate is an
intergenerational issue.

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:21.350
CO2, think order of magnets--
it's not a half life,

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:26.330
but in order of magnitude, sort
of a half-life of a century.

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.700
There will be a
lot of it around.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:33.109
Abraham Lincoln's CO2 is
still up there, in quantity.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:37.279
So we would need
to do things today

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.279
to benefit our
great grandchildren.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.500
This is not always an easy sell.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.510
Cost today, benefits
way down the line.

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.180
And another thing that's
conceptually hard--

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.910
and we're going to play with
this when we do the climate

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.189
negotiation exercise--

01:08:55.189 --> 01:09:00.560
is it's hard for people to get
their head around the dynamics

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.779
involved in CO2.

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:09.290
And we'll do just a 3-minute
exercise to make this point.

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:17.479
So I'm going to ask you
to think through what

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.200
a picture would look like.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.000
So here is the
atmospheric concentration

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.170
of carbon dioxide.

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.970
Just imagine the scenario.

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:31.130
It's risen up to
2000 to 2010-12.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:34.952
And suppose it gradually
rises and stabilizes.

01:09:34.952 --> 01:09:36.410
In fact, this is
pretty aggressive.

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.939
It stabilizes at 400
parts per million,

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:41.750
which is quite aggressive.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:47.450
And here is the
rate at which it's

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:50.240
removed from the atmosphere
by natural processes.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.830
Lets just keep life simple.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:55.030
Suppose that rate is constant.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.750
Now, think in your
head or draw a picture.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.440
So what I gave you
there was concentration

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.670
in the atmosphere.

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:07.360
A scenario-- this is
sort of actual data.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.110
This is suppose.

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:13.750
This is sort of actual
data for emissions.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:18.330
Suppose that's the rate
at which it's removed

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:20.360
from the atmosphere, right?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.910
So this is gigatons per year.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.260
These are rates.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.708
That was a stock.

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.375
These are flows.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.530
What would the
emissions path have

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.500
to look like for
this graph to be

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.560
consistent with the prior one?

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.510
OK, don't answer.

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.230
Just form an answer
in your head.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:48.960
Got it?

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.710
Got the picture?

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:51.830
Got the answer?

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.870
It has to look like that.

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:58.790
It has to come down to
equal removals at the end,

01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.990
or it doesn't stabilize.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.490
Right?

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.440
Stuff coming out has to
equal stuff coming in.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.660
Water flowing into the
bathtub has to equal water

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.410
flowing out of the bathtub.

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:13.910
Now, I assume you all got this
right because you're all smart.

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:16.720
Lots of people don't.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.420
This is a study
published in Science

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.430
that used Harvard and
MIT graduate students.

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.430
You guys are all smarter
than graduate students.

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:25.360
I understand that.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:34.860
75% of the sample
didn't get emissions

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.560
equal to removals at the end.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.680
They didn't draw a trajectory
that hit at the end.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.202
This is a little tougher,
violating conservation of mass.

01:11:44.202 --> 01:11:45.160
That's a little tricky.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.980
But over half asserted,
yeah, you can be stable.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.220
You don't have to
get to the end.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.550
You don't have to
equalize at the end.

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:57.310
Well, these are Harvard
and MIT graduate students.

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:04.100
Lawyers have even more
trouble with this.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.240
Nothing against lawyers.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.190
Some of them once were Harvard
and MIT graduate students.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:11.150
So this is missed a lot.

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:14.360
And it's a thing that
makes the negotiation

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.240
process complicated.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.950
The exercise we're
going to do here

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:24.710
is one that's been run through
with actual negotiators

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:29.240
with the purpose, developed here
by my colleague John Sterman,

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.450
of getting them to understand
at an intuitive level

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:36.530
the consequence
of those dynamics.

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:40.790
For this purpose, you think of
the atmosphere as a bathtub.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:45.530
The height of the water in the
bathtub is the concentration.

01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:47.690
Emissions is what
comes out of the faucet

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:50.360
and removals is what
goes down the drain.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.580
If you're worried about
local air pollution that

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.740
stays in the
atmosphere for hours,

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.420
you just worry about emissions.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.030
You reduce emissions
and you got it.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:02.810
For this problem,
that doesn't do it.

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:07.820
A sharp cut in emissions is
consistent with the atmosphere

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.980
having more and more
greenhouse gases.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.970
That's different.

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:16.590
That complicates the problem.

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.930
OK, so I'll just-- a
little more history.

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.360
Are there questions about that?

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.842
Yeah.

01:13:22.842 --> 01:13:24.550
STUDENT: Is the removal
rate proportional

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:26.680
to the concentration of--

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.680
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.290
Is it?

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.750
Is the removal rate proportional
to the concentration?

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.370
Sort of.

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.750
- It can be.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.835
PROFESSOR: It can be.

01:13:36.835 --> 01:13:40.750
I just did a constant rate
to make the exercise simpler.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.270
You could imagine it
rising over time slightly.

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:45.640
The same thing would
have to be true.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:50.704
You'd have to get emissions
down to removals to stabilize.

01:13:50.704 --> 01:13:53.590
STUDENT: But [INAUDIBLE]
a little bit more CO2,

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:56.500
the removal rate is rising.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
PROFESSOR: You will
stabilize at a higher level.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.420
STUDENT: Yeah, which
is also not good.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.810
PROFESSOR: 400 is
pretty aggressive.

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:09.150
OK, a little bit of history
and then we will chat today.

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:12.350
So again, this is
a set up to what

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:15.290
we'll be doing in two weeks.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:18.260
Since the '92
convention, there have

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:21.800
been 72 meetings of the
parties to that convention.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.000
The third meeting produced
the Kyoto Protocol,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.940
which obliged rich countries--
those rich countries that

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.540
ratified it-- to
reduce emissions.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.310
Many ratified.

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:35.300
We didn't.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:40.640
And President George W Bush
rejected the protocol in 2001,

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.600
and so we are the big
emitter not playing.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.190
There have been
lots more meetings.

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:51.370
The Copenhagen meeting
was widely publicized.

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.105
The most recent one
was in South Africa.

01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:59.480
17 conferences.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.840
Yeah, most recently in Durban.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.210
You are going to be
conference of the parties,

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.430
beginning at the
end of this month,

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:08.630
and you're going to solve this.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.810
OK?

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:15.970
But for now, it's 2012
and we're President Obama.

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.190
What do you do about coal?

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.150
We have a lot of coal.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.110
It's dirty.

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:23.260
Should we do more of it?

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:23.870
Less of it?

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:28.648
This is not a right
answer question.

01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:30.190
This is a what do
you think question.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.400
You surely have opinions.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.340
Yes?

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.090
STUDENT: Start with retrofitting
and using point-source capture,

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.580
which is getting
reasonably effective.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.720
I mean, even MIT--

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.830
you can make these coal
plants better and better.

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:49.710
And that could reduce
your emissions.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.780
PROFESSOR: Well, you can.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.780
We haven't done it
at commercial scale.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.420
You can imagine capturing--

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.602
if you're worried
about local pollution,

01:15:59.602 --> 01:16:01.560
yeah, you can scrub them
and make them cleaner.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.230
If you're worried
about carbon dioxide,

01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:08.340
you can take carbon
dioxide out of flue gas.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.260
It's not cheap.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.390
And then you've got
to put it someplace.

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:16.590
So you can do it, but it
may be quite expensive.

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:17.530
Yeah?

01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:20.220
STUDENT: You can retire the
really old, inefficient coal

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.760
plants and replace them
with natural gas plants.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.150
PROFESSOR: So you would
say the answer is you

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:30.054
would favor moving off coal.

01:16:30.054 --> 01:16:31.890
STUDENT: For the ones
that are inefficient,

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:34.220
that are older than all of them.

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:36.780
Matthew?

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.480
STUDENT: Although the CTL
plants weren't successful

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.638
when they were
created, it's possible

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:43.680
that we have the technology
now to make them more

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.420
successful and less expensive.

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.680
PROFESSOR: Which plants?

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.960
STUDENT: The coal to--

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.550
PROFESSOR: Coal to liquids?

01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:54.150
STUDENT: Just because they
tend to pollute less than coal

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:55.200
to electricity does.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.610
PROFESSOR: When burned.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.500
About the same amount
of CO2 lifecycle.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.575
But they burn clean.

01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:02.700
STUDENT: So that might be
more efficient or useful.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.242
PROFESSOR: So you might revisit
the coal to liquids question.

01:17:05.242 --> 01:17:07.650
Again, we're putting
shale gas off the table

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:08.940
for this discussion.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.440
You might revisit
coal to liquids

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.730
to see if we can do it better.

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:12.600
Yeah?

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.040
Anybody else, a thought?

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:14.760
Yeah, Scott?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.190
STUDENT: I heard about an
experimental technology that

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:20.940
uses the carbon dioxide
from burning coal

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.030
to create cement,
which is also a really

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:25.900
carbon-intensive process.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.060
So looking at processes like
that, or similar to that,

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.620
to see if we can develop
on a commercial scale.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.480
PROFESSOR: So you'd
spend some money on R&D

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.390
to see if we can find clean ways
to use coal, rather than give

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:40.140
up on it because we've
got so much of it.

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.250
And we touched on that one.

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.240
Electric vehicles.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.590
Any electric vehicle fans?

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.860
Is that a way to use the coal?

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.773
Brendan?

01:17:51.773 --> 01:17:53.745
STUDENT: Yeah, I
think it makes sense

01:17:53.745 --> 01:17:56.078
to move toward electric
vehicles because we can increase

01:17:56.078 --> 01:18:00.780
our grid side by adding
additional plants in terms

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.966
of looking at natural
gas or nuclear plants

01:18:03.966 --> 01:18:06.520
to make up the difference.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.090
PROFESSOR: So you think electric
vehicles are a good thing

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:11.010
to explore, at least.

01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:13.790
Cost, an issue?

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.200
STUDENT: Well, with projected
rises in oil prices,

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.680
not so much.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.560
Not as much as I would
be if they were--

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.030
PROFESSOR: I need
to put up a graph

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.860
of the forecast of
oil prices in 1980,

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.300
which were just
amazing and all wrong.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.248
But, you know, you're right.

01:18:29.248 --> 01:18:31.290
If I'm betting money, I'm
betting in the long-run

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.560
up, but not down,
particularly with the rise

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.950
of with the rise of China.

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:42.180
OK, 30 seconds of
free-for-all before we break.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.787
Any other policies
that we haven't

01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:45.870
talked about that we should
have talked about that

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.700
will deal with this thing?

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.900
Have you a silver bullet?

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.340
We've all been looking for one.

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.840
STUDENT: I'm extremely
pro-nuclear energy,

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.110
but I understand that
it's extremely expensive.

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:57.610
One of the reasons
it's so expensive

01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:00.450
is because of all the
regulation and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:02.460
I would like to
reform regulation.

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:05.240
I think that would be-- move
toward a long-term nuclear

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.350
solution.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:10.320
Maybe use natural gas
as an interim solution.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.805
It's easier and cheaper
compared to a natural--

01:19:13.805 --> 01:19:16.100
PROFESSOR: Well, there
have been some reforms

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.400
to nuclear regulation like
design licensing instead

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.660
of plant licensing.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.060
But one issue is Fukushima.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:24.560
OK--

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.550
STUDENT: Fukushima was--

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:26.000
PROFESSOR: I know.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:26.360
I know.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:26.860
I know.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:27.770
I know.

01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:30.290
One last thing I'd
like you to do.

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:34.280
Could you for one
second close your eyes?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.400
Close your eyes.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.680
Because I don't want people
looking at each other.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.160
Those of you who think of
yourselves as libertarians,

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.770
small government
Republican-types,

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:48.300
please raise your hands.

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.850
Down, please.

01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:53.180
Those of you who think of
yourselves as kind of liberal

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:57.080
Democratic,
I-don't-want-the-poor-to-starve,

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.860
raise your hands.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.320
OK, you're going to try
to put the Republicans

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.820
on one side of this debate and
the Democrats on the other.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:11.740
We're going to have a bit of a
debate next Tuesday between two

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.170
opposing views of the
role of government.

01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:15.700
I just wanted to
see how you divide.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.290
There are a lot of agnostics.

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:21.100
Democrats outnumber Republicans.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.410
So think about that as
you read for next week.

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:26.220
Have a good weekend.

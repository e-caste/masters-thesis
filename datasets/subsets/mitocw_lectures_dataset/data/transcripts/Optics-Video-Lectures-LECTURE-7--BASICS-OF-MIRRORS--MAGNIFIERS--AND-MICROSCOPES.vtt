00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.500
PROFESSOR: So today, in some
ways, that word for what

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.110
we've been suffering through
for the last few lectures

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.680
because we'll actually get to
see some optical instruments

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.790
and how they work.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.840
So we'll basically
put all of these tools

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.870
and all of the terminology
and the matrices

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.750
and the formulas
and all that, we'll

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
put it to work for the basic
optical systems, namely

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.740
microscope and telescope.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.130
And we'll also look at
sort of the building

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130
block of a microscope
which is a magnifier lens.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.530
But before we do
that, I would like

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.600
to spend some time just
reviewing basically

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.720
all the fundamental
material before it will go

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.120
into the application systems.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.290
I would like to do review
the fundamental material.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.362
So the first four
or five slides--

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:19.070
I don't remember.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.780
I think five.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840
They're not really new.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050
I just brought them--

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
just copied them from
the previous lectures

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.280
as a kind of overview.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.000
And I would like, instead
of just describing it again,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.510
I would like to encourage you--

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.237
I will pass on it
and I would like

00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:37.070
to encourage you to ask
any questions if you

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.290
have on this particular
topic or something related.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.200
So the first topic is the
ray transfer matrices.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.540
And again, very
briefly to remind you,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.180
this comes about because at
a fraction at the spherical

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.880
dielectric interface is
very complex to deal with,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.050
not the very complex.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.400
It is actually pretty simple.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.920
But algebraically
complicated, or I

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.070
should say trigonometrically,
very complicated.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.860
So because we don't want
to deal with that stuff.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220
And it also hides a
lot of the intuition,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.640
we derived this paraxial
approximation which

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.820
is true for a pretty limited--

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.900
typically 10 to 30 degrees.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.440
Actually 30 is too optimistic,
maybe 10 to 20 degrees

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.870
from the optical axis.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.540
We discovered that there
is a linear relationship

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.900
between them, elevation and
angle of a ray that is arriving

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.540
from the left to the interface.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.010
And the elevation and angle
of propagation of array

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.430
that is departing to the
right over the interface,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.130
the same rate, that
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.370
And of course, the elevation
is the same because

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.590
of the paraxial
approximation, we

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.650
neglect the thickness
of the instrument.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
So basically, no matter where
the ray hits, here or here

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.020
or here, it is all the same.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.850
So that helps.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.070
And the second is that the
angle, basically the angle

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.160
satisfies Snell's
law with respect

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.180
to the normal at this sphere
at this location over here.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.070
But of course, because
this orientation

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.640
depends on the relative position
of the arrival of the ray

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.650
and the center of
the sphere, then we

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.940
simplified it using the
paraxial approximations.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.970
And we discovered this
expression over here.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.680
So the relationship between
the right and the left angle,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.370
it has to do with the elevation.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.440
So if you look at
this equation, it

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.360
says that n-right, alpha-right
equals n-left alpha-left.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800
That's the first term.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.350
And then the interesting part
is the second one that says

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.660
equals minus this quantity
times the elevation of the ray.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.940
So that tells you
that the more--

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.830
the higher the arrival elevation
of the ray, the more it bends.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.460
And that makes sense because
the higher the arrival,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.850
the larger the angle that
it makes with respect

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.920
to the normal to the sphere
and, therefore, if you wish,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.890
the more violent the
Snell's law will be.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.890
And of course, you can imagine,
as you increase the angle,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.220
eventually the angle
becomes so large

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.250
that the paraxial
approximation breaks down.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.570
But this is all true.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.535
Before the approximation
breaks down,

00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:41.950
the progression is linear.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.730
It is linear in the position.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.090
And the quantity that appears
here, does anybody remember?

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.340
How do you call this quantity?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.200
Optical power.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.630
Correct.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.005
Could you please
push the button?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.660
Correct.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.540
It's called the optical power.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.570
And it is actually
the first instance

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.970
that we saw this quantity.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.620
It is the inverse
distance units.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.760
But we don't call
it inverse meters.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.450
We call it-- how do we call
the unit of this quantity?

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.835
Diopters, right?

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:24.020
AUDIENCE: So professor,
I have a quick question.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.850
Here we have quantity
over radius r.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.540
Does this describe a
hyperboloid or elliptical shaped

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.203
or a spherical lens?

00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:35.120
And if so, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.537
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:39.420
AUDIENCE: For example, with the
spherical or an elliptical lens

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.970
that has two different radiuses.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.137
How do you account for that?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.100
PROFESSOR: So this derivation,
we actually did for a sphere.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.650
So the radius here is the radius
of the spherical interface.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.530
And a very similar
relationship would

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.150
hold if instead of
a sphere you had

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.530
another ovoid, another
surface of revolution which

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.220
would be symmetric around
the axis over here.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.280
So for example, if
I put a parabola.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.540
Imagine a parabolic bowl where
this is the cross section

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.670
of the parabola.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.330
But then if you spin it around
this axis, it remains the same.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.810
This is called a
paraboloid of a revolution.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.810
This is actually-- I
believe this was a homework

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.600
or actually we'll do it
a little bit later today.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.790
We'll discover that
a very similar--

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.800
actually in the same equation
holds, except in the case

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.300
r is not that radius
of the parabola

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.390
if the parabola does
not have a radius,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.680
but it does have a
curvature near the axis.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.200
So the curvature of
the parabola, actually

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.050
the inverse of the curvature
is-- the radius of curvature

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.720
is what enters this equation.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.030
Now we discussed.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.950
an ellipsoid.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.230
And you are right that the
ellipsoid has two axes.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.100
But the ellipsoid that
we saw, the two axes

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.440
are oriented a different way.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.950
So in the ellipsoid
that we saw, when

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.830
the actual propagation
is z, then we have

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.640
one of the lateral axis is x.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.440
And we show that the
perfect focusing element,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.950
the perfect focusing
refractive element

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.170
is an ellipsoid looks like this.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.090
So of course, this has
a major and minor axis.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.320
But you can see that
the ellipsoid is still

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.300
symmetric with respect
to the optical axis.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.680
So in other words, it is still
an ellipsoid of revolution

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.320
around the z-axis.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.650
So I don't have to worry
about 2 radii of curvature.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.900
But it is still a valid
question, what you are asking.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.010
What if I did have-- what if
I do put the surface there

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.140
with [INAUDIBLE] of curvature?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.370
Well, it turns out,
you will seldom

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.000
see this in books except basic--

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.770
I don't think I've
ever seen it in a book.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.180
But we can reconstruct
what you should do.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.700
This is slightly
incomplete because I'm only

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.460
dealing with elevation
of the ray and the angle

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.490
in a cross section of the plane.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.780
And that is fine here because
it is a surface of revolution.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.670
But if it is not a
surface of revolution,

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.340
then I have to grow
this to a 4 vector

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:29.130
with two angles
and two elevations.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.299
And then this would
become a 4 by 4 matrix.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.610
And then it would have a
different power in each axis,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.909
depending on the
Gaussian curvature

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.659
of the surface in the
corresponding location where

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.049
the ray hits the axis.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.840
So you can imagine it will
become a very complicated kind

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.020
of situation.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.180
So typically we
don't deal with this.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.456
I don't even know if optical
elements are designed this way.

00:08:56.456 --> 00:09:12.892
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:16.080
CREW: Can you press
the button, please?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.580
Oh.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.030
You cannot hear?

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.130
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.800
I pressed it but it didn't
seem to do anything.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.760
You can hear now?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.260
CREW: Yes.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.760
Yes.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.610
AUDIENCE: I was just saying
that I haven't come across this

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.010
for geometrical objects either.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.060
But I have seen it for
diffraction optics,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.143
in terms of the Wigner
distribution function.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.810
And what I was going
to carry on to say,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.600
though, was for the
geometric optics case,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.940
it might be quite
interesting because it

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.620
would allow you to look at
the behavior of skew rays.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.690
So it might actually give some
quite interesting information,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.190
I think.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.320
That's true, yeah.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.612
And you could also look at
things like caustics, right?

00:09:55.612 --> 00:09:59.810
You know, if you make the
surface non-rotationally

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.170
symmetric, you get new
different caustics.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.670
Forgive us.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.950
We got into a slightly
esoteric conversation here.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.770
But that's a really
good question.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.330
So we may end up writing a
paper about this in a few months

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.710
or something.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.210
Great.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.001
Any other questions?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.375
AUDIENCE: Isn't this problem
separable in x and y?

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.350
PROFESSOR: Actually,
before I answer that.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.390
Let me bring up a
trivial case where

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.980
you might have this situation.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.830
That's a cylindrical lens.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.250
The analysis with it is
actually valid for two cases.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.340
One is when you have a surface
of revolution, like a sphere.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.840
The other is if you
have a cylinder,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.060
in which case,
everything is invariant

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.110
in the out-of-place direction.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.940
So that's just a
trivial case where

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.170
you have a radius of
curvature in one plane.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.440
And the curvature is--

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.240
the register is
infinite in other plane.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.520
That is, we a plane, a
planar surface, right?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.250
That's also called
a cylindrical lens.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.040
And of course the cylindrical
lens does not focus to a point.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.658
It focuses on a line.

00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:09.700
There's no focus in here.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.670
But you can imagine if
you focus on the line out.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.170
I'm sorry.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.360
So what was the question?

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the question was,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.960
isn't the problem
separable in x and y.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.230
So we could just extend
the matrix in y direction,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.945
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:26.940
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.870
I think that's true.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.360
The paraxial approximation,
it is separable, yeah.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.700
But of course, if you go off
the paraxial approximation,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.740
things like [INAUDIBLE] and
so on, then all bets are off.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.040
They become highly coupled.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.030
So for example, astigmatism
is highly coupled.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.440
You cannot [INAUDIBLE] with--

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.000
astigmatism for those of you
who are not unfortunate enough

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.240
to have it in your own
eyeglass prescription,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.222
astigmatism is a situation where
an optical system focuses--

00:12:00.222 --> 00:12:04.850
it's kind of difficult. I'll
go into it in next week.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.880
It's a form of aberration
where an optical system has

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.960
different focusing properties
for tangential rays as opposed

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.677
to the sagittal rays.

00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:15.260
I don't want to
confuse you right now.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.880
But it is a form
of operation that

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.090
has to do with skew
rays that arrive in sort

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.120
of off-axis and off-plane.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.810
And it is actually
very common in people.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.790
Very often those
of us who wear--

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.005
does anybody know you
if you have astigmatism

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:33.880
in your prescription?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.380
Yeah.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:37.590
That's right.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.090
Yes.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.309
So it means that his glasses
are not exactly spherical.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.990
Other questions?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.560
The next step--
so this we did, I

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.980
believe it was two
weeks ago or so.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.440
Then the next thing
that we did is

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.320
we took this formulation
basically-- oh,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.540
and before I move on
let me just remind you

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.730
very briefly why we did this.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.530
This looks kind of silly.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.910
It tells you that if you have a
ray propagating in free space,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.240
again you can relate
the elevation and angle

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.180
to the left of some
chunk of free space

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.060
to the ray elevation
and angle to the right

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.847
of that chunk of free space.

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:37.180
That's, again, that looks silly.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.220
Because we know
the ray propagates

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.120
in a straight line in free space
or in uniform space because

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.033
of Fermat principle.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.450
And of course,
what will happen is

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.920
that the angle of propagation
will remain the same.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.890
That's what this law says.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.940
And also the elevation
will increase

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.270
by the distance
times the tangent

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.030
of the angle of propagation.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.450
But of course, with the
paraxial approximations,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.533
instead of the tangent
we put the angle itself.

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:11.200
So this is what this
equation says here.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.280
If you multiply this by this,
the indices of refraction

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.430
will drop out.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.680
And you're left with d,
the distance times alpha.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.880
So it is really the tangent.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.750
So this seems silly.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.030
But the reason we did
it is so that when

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.650
we have optical systems with
a cascade of uniform space

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.010
then add the refractive
interface and then more uniform

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.620
space and so on, then
you can basically

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.260
ray trace those systems simply
by cascading these matrices.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.950
So this is why we did
this particular pattern.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.990
But this really doesn't
say anything other

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.560
than rays must propagate
in a straight line

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.100
in uniform refractive index
because that is the shortest

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.200
path for them to follow.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.740
And then what we did, after
we developed this formulation,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.670
is we actually put into practice
in the special case of two

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.650
adjacent spherical surfaces.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.970
So typically, you
have air outside.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.400
And between the two
surfaces, you have glass.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.170
And this kind of
element is what we call

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.060
in everyday language a lens.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.290
It does not have to be glass.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.630
For example, in the case of
our eyes, it's not glass.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:30.210
It is actually tissue,
mostly water in fact.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.070
But anyway, it is higher
index of refraction

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.500
than the surrounding air.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.785
So it is acting--

00:15:35.785 --> 00:15:39.650
it is doing the
same job as a lens.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.290
And what we did then, if you
recall, I will not do all of it

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.860
again is but what we did is we
did a cascade of the matrices

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.510
for the two interfaces.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.170
And based on this, we derived
the properties of this element.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.450
And what we discovered
is the basic properties

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.450
that if you have had a ray
bundle that is arriving

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.630
from infinity, therefore
it is razor parallel,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.670
this type of optical
element will actually

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.050
bring them to a focus.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.710
So the rays after, they will
propagate a certain distance

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.160
after the element.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.350
And then they will
focus to a point.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.440
And we also derive the
other useful quantities,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.970
we derive the elevation
of this point.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.910
We discover that
it is proportional

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.110
to this focal distance times
the annual propagation.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.210
And then we saw that
there's different cases

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.480
of focusing depending on
the nature of the lens.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.330
Namely its optical power.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.610
So positive lens will focus
the rays at a finite distance.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.410
A negative lens will actually
cause the rays to diverge.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.170
So they, strictly
speaking, do not focus.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.140
But if you extend
them backwards,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.690
then that create what is
called a virtual image.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.830
And we will see later today
what exactly this virtual image

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.190
means and why it is an
extremely useful concept

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.600
in optical design.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.220
For now, it appears
as an oddity.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.210
What exactly is that?

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.560
Why did it move-- why did
it trace the rays backwards.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.963
But today, actually, you
will see why this is useful.

00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:06.380
The main point to
take out of here

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.619
is that the lens is acting
kind of like a lever.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.906
So if you have--

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:16.910
if you imagine that you
are rotating the angle

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.910
that the rays are arriving
to the left of the lens,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.480
then this point is
moving linearly.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.150
It is staying on this
plane, ideally at least,

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.920
within the paraxial
approximation.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.880
It is staying on this
plane but it is moving.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.970
So as you rotate the angle,
the elevation changes.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.760
And the constant of
proportionality in this change

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.570
is the focal length of the lens.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.190
This is a very key point
to remember about lenses

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.160
and how they function.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.400
And the other thing that
we said is that it can also

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.140
work the other way around.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.000
If you take this
picture, the rule

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.720
is that the rays always go
from the left to the right.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.285
It's not a rule,
it is a convention.

00:18:02.285 --> 00:18:04.410
There's no physical law,
obviously, that says that.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.720
But it's a convention.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.580
But nevertheless,
there is a physical law

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:15.030
that says that if a light
propagates in one direction

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.410
and then you flip
the time backwards,

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.130
that is you reverse the
propagation of the light,

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.060
then the physical law actually
says that the propagation

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.570
should remain invariant.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.930
That is if I knew that the light
propagated this way focuses,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.800
if I turn time backwards
like these old movies

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.020
that you see where they
play the movie backwards

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.110
and you see it pass, you
know, moving towards the back.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.710
If I did that, I would have
the rays going like this.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.240
So this against our convention.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.560
So that's why I flipped it here.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.100
Now again, the rays are
going from left to right

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.950
but in this case they're
going through the focus.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.360
What this picture is telling us
is that if you have rays that

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.980
originate at the point one
focal distance behind the lens,

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.510
then this will form
an image at infinity.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.500
That is, the lens will
collimate this ray bundle.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.405
And it will send the
rays out parallel at a 90

00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:09.030
that obeys, actually
if you look at it,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.240
is the same relationship
that was obeyed before.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.230
With the next reminder sign.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.930
And why did the minus
sign come about?

00:19:25.573 --> 00:19:27.740
Everything's symmetric here
except for this annoying

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.560
minus sign.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.600
Why has this come about?

00:19:45.344 --> 00:19:47.840
Button.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.220
Did you do a button?

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.860
Go to some desk, so
you have a button.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.580
AUDIENCE: The object
distance, is it?

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:01.000
PROFESSOR: Maybe
not the distance.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.430
We have distances
and what else here?

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.840
AUDIENCE: The angle is negative.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.490
PROFESSOR: The
angle, that's right.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.050
The only reason
this negative sign

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.720
appears there is
the sign convention.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.320
This angle here, we
define it as positive.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.660
This angle here is the same.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.290
But that's not how
we measure angles.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.170
We always measure
angles this way.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.100
So therefore, this
angle is negative.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.850
So to account for
this negative angle,

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.230
a negative sign
appears over there.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.630
AUDIENCE: I have
another quick question.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.510
Let's say we have a lens
where our left and our right

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.390
are the same, which I believe
is pretty common in optics.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.130
So from the lens
makers equation you

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.053
would get that
1/f is equal to 0.

00:20:40.053 --> 00:20:40.720
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.960
AUDIENCE: Or is that wrong?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.630
Because you get 1
minus a quantity--

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.510
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
That's not true, actually.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.360
If the red is to the left
is equal to the-- well,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.450
depends how you are.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.600
Is it like this or like this?

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.310
AUDIENCE: It's like this,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.350
PROFESSOR: Like this?

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.142
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:20:58.142 --> 00:20:58.770
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.030
Let me give you a hint.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:07.340
If it was really like
this, we have 1 and 1.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.600
Now it is the same
radius of curvature,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.130
and that would indeed have
no power, no optical power.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.410
Their focal length
would be infinity

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.830
or the optical power would be 0.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.332
In this case, are the radii
of curvature the same or not?

00:21:26.332 --> 00:21:28.290
AUDIENCE: So one's negative
and one's positive.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.000
Is that what you're saying?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.830
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.430
They're not the same.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.258
They're opposite.

00:21:31.258 --> 00:21:31.800
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.300
Thanks.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.372
PROFESSOR: So they may be
the same in absolute value.

00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:36.580
But they have opposite signs.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.530
Therefore in this
case, you actually

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.000
get a finite focal length.

00:21:42.508 --> 00:21:44.550
I'm sorry, I don't think
you could see what I do.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.260
Other questions?

00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:02.200
It was a very good question.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.990
I'm very glad you asked that.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:09.570
We have to be very careful when
we apply these formulas to use

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.010
the proper sign.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:17.500
So remember the curvatures
by the sign convention, which

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.180
I really recommend that you--

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.100
I don't have it available here.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.580
But I really recommend
you go back and study it.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.990
The convention is that if the
curvature points like this,

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.750
it is convex towards
the left, then

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.640
it is called a
positive curvature.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.100
So in this case, you
would write, for example,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.390
you would write r equals
maybe it is 10 centimeters.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.870
In this case, because the
surface now is concave,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.780
then you would say that R
equals minus 10 centimeters.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.900
So the lens make an
equation in this case,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.180
we'll say-- let's say n
equals 1.5 for example.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:08.650
Let's make it, I would say,
1/f equals 1.5 minus 1 times

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.140
1 over 10 minus 1 over minus 10.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.015
And this is whatever.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.460
I believe it is 3 or something.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.030
Wait.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:32.510
This is 1/5, or
there's 0.5 times 1/5.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.880
So it is 1 over 10 so it is 10.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.520
Other questions?

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.040
So this was true for what
we call the thin lens, where

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.330
it is thin because we
assume that the distance

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.500
between the surfaces within
the paraxial approximation

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.970
can be neglected.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:20.070
If we cannot do that, if we
cannot neglect the distance

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.990
between the two surfaces, our
formulation does not abandon

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.050
us, we just get a more
complicated formula.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.610
And the reason the formula
becomes more complicated

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.410
is because if we drop
the approximation

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.740
of negligible
spacing then the ray

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.480
refracts twice before exiting.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.620
It will diffract at
the first interface

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.480
and the second interface.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.800
We'll get the formula for this.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.950
The thick lens, I don't want
to go back into the formula.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.900
It just comes out
of the algebra.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.970
What I really want to
emphasize in this case

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.020
is that even though
the refracts doubly,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.740
we can pretend that it
only refracted once.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.240
And we can do that by
extending the incoming ray,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.460
extending the outgoing ray.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.780
And then what the plane,
where they intersect,

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.210
that is called the
principal plane.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.460
Actually that is called
the second principal plane.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.100
If I do it for an
incoming ray bundle that

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.360
is imaged at infinity then
it is the other way around.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.110
Again, it can extend the
incoming ray, the outgoing ray,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.930
and again get the
first principal plane.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.270
And the reason we did
all this exercise were

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.480
to discover principal
planes and so on

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.740
is because this
allows us to do ray

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.350
tracing as shown over there.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.460
Can you still hear me?

00:25:54.095 --> 00:25:54.595
Sorry.

00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:56.410
This microphone has
a tendency to fall.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.630
OK.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.186
You can still hear me?

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:02.640
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.890
PROFESSOR: Thanks.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.390
OK.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.090
So the reason we
did this exercise

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.290
of effective focal
length and so on

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.830
is because we can play
the following take.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.545
I can give you an optical
system with a bunch of lenses.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.290
I don't know, whatever.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.160
Very complicated.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.370
And I'm asking you to find
the imaging condition.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.640
Here's an object.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.725
And I'm asking you
where is the image.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.650
What is the magnification?

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.660
Lateral, angular, and so on.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.550
This [INAUDIBLE] of
principal planes,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:47.910
it applies as we discussed
not only on a thick lens

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.330
but in general in any
compound optical system that

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.210
contains multiple
elements like this one.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.180
And in order to utilize it,
what you do is you throw out,

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.350
so to speak, all of this
entire system and you

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.230
replace it with its
principal planes.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.670
So here is, let's say that the
principal planes are like this.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.000
Here's the first
principal plane,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.960
the second principal plane.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.490
And now I can do the imaging
business very simply.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.670
Here's my object.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:28.690
If I take a ray that goes
horizontal from the object,

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:36.660
this ray, it is as if
it came from infinity.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.400
So therefore this ray will go
to the second principal plane,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.960
it will bend.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.440
And it will meet the axis
one effective focal length

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.160
to the right of the
second principal plane.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.730
Then I can take
another ray which goes

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.190
through the first focal point.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.130
That goes one focal
length to the--

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.917
I'm sorry, did I say
to the left before?

00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:07.250
I should have said to the right.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.100
Let me repeat.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.540
So this ray will go--

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.410
will hit the optical
access one focal distance

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.410
to the right of the
second principal plane.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.260
I think I said the
wrong thing before.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.650
Anyway, to the right.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.970
Now let me take a ray that goes
through the focal point one

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:31.182
focal distance to the left
of the first principal plane.

00:28:31.182 --> 00:28:32.390
I will run out of space here.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.820
But that's OK.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.950
This ray will have to hit
the first principal plane

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.120
and then turn horizontal.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.460
Because this is equivalent to a
point source one focal distance

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.620
to the left of the lens that
would be [INAUDIBLE] infinity.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.620
So therefore, this ray
must come out horizontal.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.980
And where these rays
meet is actually

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.400
where my image is located.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.850
This construction is very useful
and very basic and fundamental.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:08.920
And that's why the principal
planes are important.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.660
Now let's try this.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.740
Any questions about this?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.660
AUDIENCE: Since we
have principal planes

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:25.590
for the system, are we going
to substitute the system

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.580
by a matrix which
is for single lens?

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.270
Like 1, minus 1 over f, 0.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.950
But that's not
going to be possible

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.960
because the single lens
doesn't change the angle

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.473
but the system can change
the position and angle both.

00:29:41.473 --> 00:29:42.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.280
The system is not
equivalent to a thin lens.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280
It's a little bit weird.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.950
This equivalent,
you can think of it

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.200
as having two thick lenses.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.380
One of them is
operating for this ray.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.290
This is like a thin
lens but for this ray.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.600
This is like a thin
lens but for this ray.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.550
That's a bit confusing
to think of it like that.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.050
Right?

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.527
So I so would
rather not go there.

00:30:07.527 --> 00:30:09.610
But yeah, if you look at
the matrix of the system,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.080
it is not a matrix
of a thin lens.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.570
Of course not.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.070
Yeah.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.525
Yeah?

00:30:13.525 --> 00:30:20.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:21.390
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.670
That was actually my question.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.912
So he's asking, what if the
focal length is negative.

00:30:25.912 --> 00:30:26.870
How would you the ray--

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.700
this is what you're
asking, right?

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.390
Yeah.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.280
So that was actually
my-- the next thing

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.660
I was going to do also here.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.620
So let's take this
out of the way.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.760
Take this out all the way too
because the marker leaked.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.855
The marker leaked here.

00:30:38.855 --> 00:30:39.832
Oh, OK.

00:30:39.832 --> 00:30:41.040
We're wasting too much paper.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.140
So let's do the same game now.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.950
But now let's say that the
focal length is negative.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:59.300
So here is an object.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.260
And here are the two
principal planes.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.180
Let's say this is the
first principal plane,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.668
the second principal plane.

00:31:11.668 --> 00:31:13.210
How would the ray
trace in this case?

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.000
Would I have a
negative focal length?

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.030
Does someone want
to help me trace it?

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.460
Button.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.380
AUDIENCE: You first propagate
to second principal plane

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:31.880
and then--

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.713
PROFESSOR: So [INAUDIBLE]
the horizontal ray

00:31:33.713 --> 00:31:37.380
to the second principal plane.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:37.980
Now what?

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.228
AUDIENCE: Come back.

00:31:39.228 --> 00:31:40.116
PROFESSOR: Come back?

00:31:40.116 --> 00:31:45.330
AUDIENCE: In the sense
that the ray diverges

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.166
from the first plane.

00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:50.293
PROFESSOR: But
we'll have to go--

00:31:50.293 --> 00:31:51.710
well, why drawing's
not very good.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.785
Let's say that this
is the focal point.

00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:57.410
So [INAUDIBLE] diverge
in this fashion.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:57.800
Right?

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.690
Yeah.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.190
PROFESSOR: What
about the other one?

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.937
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:20.937 --> 00:32:23.270
PROFESSOR: First of all, where
is the first focal point?

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.377
AUDIENCE: On the right
panel [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:26.710
PROFESSOR: They cannot hear you.

00:32:32.662 --> 00:32:34.750
AUDIENCE: Probably
should take rays

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.975
from the object to
the first focal point,

00:32:37.975 --> 00:32:39.100
there's a back focal point.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.970
PROFESSOR: So where is that?

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.387
AUDIENCE: That's
on the right side

00:32:41.387 --> 00:32:43.240
of the first principal plane.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.616
PROFESSOR: Should be
somewhere around here, right?

00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:47.995
AUDIENCE: And at the point
where they intersect,

00:32:47.995 --> 00:32:48.870
you make it parallel.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.660
PROFESSOR: So this is minus f.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.000
This is minus f.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.500
Right?

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.125
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:55.125 --> 00:32:56.720
PROFESSOR: With the distances.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.220
OK.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.095
So then what do I do?

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.900
AUDIENCE: The
point where the ray

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.270
meets the first principal
plane we make it

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.710
parallel to the optical axis?

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.710
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.430
So what I have to
do is first of all

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.510
I draw a dashed line
that goes to this point.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.640
This tells me which way
this would be pointing.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.320
This will have to
go all the way here.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.990
Yeah, that's right.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:40.688
And then-- So
where is the image?

00:33:52.978 --> 00:33:53.520
That's right.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.610
The image is actually
where these rays

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.510
are supposed to meet.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.170
Right?

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.430
They never quite meet.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.590
But I have to extend
one of them backwards so

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.870
they would actually meet here.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.000
And notice the
significant difference

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.380
that here the image erect.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:15.540
It is upside, which is
customary for virtual images.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.780
Whereas in this case, the image
if you recall the image quite

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.025
clearly, it was inverted.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.989
So it is really
the same approach.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.730
I haven't changed anything.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:36.429
But the only thing I
have to do, really,

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.520
is be careful with the signs.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.105
Who is to the left of whom.

00:34:41.105 --> 00:34:44.639
And the way we keep track of
that and we don't lose our head

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:50.260
is by faithfully following
the sign conventions.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.520
So the definition is that
the positive focal length

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.980
would be to the right of
the second principal plane.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.480
OK.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.110
Fine.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.240
If I'm given a
negative focal length,

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.110
that means that I
should go to the left

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.550
of the second principal plane.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.480
And so on and so forth.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.103
That's the principle.

00:35:15.745 --> 00:35:16.620
What about this case?

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.287
Can I have this?

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.110
Of course I can.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.240
Interactive homework,
you'll see a system

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.440
that has that property.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.130
The second principal
plane is to the left

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.600
of the first principal plane.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.800
There's no rule or
law against that.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.600
What we do?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600
Nothing changed, really.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.330
I can still do my ray
tracing as before.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.480
If I were to do
my rotation here,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.000
well, it would go up to
the second principal plane.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.468
I would shift the ray down.

00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:01.010
Let's say this is
one focal distance.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.520
And then now let me do
the other one correctly.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.675
So this is the first principal
plane so to go from here--

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:13.850
something like that.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:17.150
I mean, that produced
a ridiculously--

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.970
Well, we're here.

00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:23.912
I did something wrong here so
the image ended up very close

00:36:23.912 --> 00:36:24.870
to the principal plane.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.270
But this is how you would
ray trace the system.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.330
Any questions about the
stuff I'm doing here?

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.930
So when you're given
an optical system

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.140
it's a little bit
of a judgment call.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.580
You have-- what happened.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.570
Some message flashed.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.920
Something got disconnected.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.263
Are we still there?

00:37:01.263 --> 00:37:04.560
CREW: Yep.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.710
PROFESSOR: So when you
have an optical system

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.330
there is three ways
you can analyze it.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.320
One is you can just
blindly write down

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.660
the cascade of matrices,
figure out the incoming

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.750
and an outgoing angles.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.730
And then try to
solve it this way.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.790
The second way is you
find the principal planes.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.560
And then you apply one
of these techniques

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.120
that I just did on paper.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.040
And this is another
way to analyze it.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.250
The third way, which is
what I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.680
did in the class and was also
the supplement of your nodes

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.690
is where you take each length.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.622
You apply the imaging condition
individually and then move on.

00:37:46.622 --> 00:37:47.580
I will not do it again.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.500
It's in the example
of your notes.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.450
But it's a little bit
of a judgment call.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.730
And sometimes it's a different
matter of preference.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.340
Some people are very
good with matrices.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.990
So it is just
better in that case

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:01.470
to just multiply the matrices
and get done with it.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.070
The principal planes that
give you more intuition.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.920
So I'm personally not in favor
of just blindly multiplying

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.480
matrices.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.120
That's a little
bit mind numbing.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.080
And also very prone to algebraic
errors because we're all human.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.110
But this method of
principal planes,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.830
they're a little bit less prone
to algebraic errors because

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.690
with these methods, you can
actually test your intuition.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.130
You can see easily, whether
what you are doing is correct

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.820
or not.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.610
Whereas you make an algebraic
mistake doing the matrix

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.340
multiplications, well,
it's very difficult

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.850
to know where it happened.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.860
And in fact, I confess
when I wrote the supplement

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.805
to the notes which is--

00:38:42.805 --> 00:38:44.680
I don't know if you had
the chance to see it,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.270
but it is the same
optical system solved

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.830
with the three different ways.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.450
You know, with first of all
with the cascade of lenses

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.150
then with matrices and
then with principal planes.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:59.100
So I confess that I first did
it with a cascade of lenses.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.330
So I took the first lens.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.170
I imaged it.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.320
Then I used the image
of the first lens

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.170
as objects to the second
lens and I imaged again

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.310
and I found the answer.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:13.670
Then I took a plan, I
got a big cup of coffee,

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.328
I did all the algebra
of the matrices,

00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:17.120
I actually got the
wrong result. It was not

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.580
a green with the first result.
So I went back and made it

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.160
again and finally I
got the algebra correct

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.840
and I got the two
results to agree.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.620
But for sure, the
first thing I did it

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.950
with the cascade of
lenses was correct.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.020
Then every time I got
a different result

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.520
with the matrices,
I knew that I was

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.380
making an algebraic mistake.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.210
Until I finally got
the matrices to agree

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.300
with the actual result.
And I got it right.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.800
So there reason I'm
telling you this

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.980
is because I've taught
this class for 10 years,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.330
believe it or not.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.930
So every time when we
do the quiz number one,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.120
your colleagues in
the past they all

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.730
try to solve the
problem with matrices.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.830
Because it is easier.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:56.950
Matrices is a no-brainer.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.000
You just multiply
and get the result.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.260
About 70%-- over
all these years,

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.590
I have accurate statistics.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.700
About 70% they get stuck
into some algebraic error.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.120
And then they cannot solve the
problem because the measure

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.732
of this is if you get
the ray tracing wrong,

00:40:14.732 --> 00:40:15.690
you cannot do anything.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.350
You can not do magnification.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.990
You can not do whatever.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.950
So I would only
recommend the matrices

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.830
if you are really, really
sharp with algebra.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.540
Otherwise, you're better off--

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.040
and actually overall,
I think you're

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.380
better off if you land in
the physics, which is not

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.790
what the matrices give you.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.620
The matrices are convenient.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.680
For example, we derived all
of these based on matrices.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.850
But after that we should
let our intuition take over.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.005
And not rely just on the
math, which is actually

00:40:45.005 --> 00:40:47.380
a pretty good principle in
anything you do in engineering

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.570
but it is especially true here.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.120
Any questions?

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.030
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:05.720
So for the focal length
that is negative,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.190
if you retrace the rate
coming from the object

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:15.760
say to the center of the
first principle plane.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.915
So this--

00:41:16.915 --> 00:41:18.790
PROFESSOR: No, you don't
trace through center

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.207
with the principal plane, you
trace it to the focal point.

00:41:21.207 --> 00:41:22.560
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.640
I mean, it means that, so in
this case for the focal lens

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.580
is a positive.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:36.560
So we have three [INAUDIBLE]
characteristics arrays

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.350
for the--

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.725
PROFESSOR: Oh,
you mean this ray?

00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:41.596
AUDIENCE: So OC, ray OC.

00:41:41.596 --> 00:41:43.095
PROFESSOR: This ray?

00:41:43.095 --> 00:41:43.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.410
Yeah.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.573
So for the focal length
that is negative,

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.490
can we draw that line?

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:56.280
So you will find that the
intersection of those rays

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.568
would not meet the
objects you found.

00:41:59.568 --> 00:42:00.610
PROFESSOR: Oh, it should.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.200
It should.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.660
If I had drawn it
properly, it should.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.880
If you drew this ray,
if you drew this ray

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.210
and then you extend
this ray backwards,

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:13.230
it should still go
through my image point.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.130
AUDIENCE: No.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.220
It shouldn't.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.620
PROFESSOR: You're right that
they don't meet because this

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.300
is a virtual image.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.020
What does meet is their
extensions backwards.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.220
But when you draw it, but--

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:32.030
so you see those
angle relationship.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.650
So there--

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.703
PROFESSOR: Well, that's because
my drawing is not very good.

00:42:36.703 --> 00:42:38.120
If I had done the
drawing properly

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.245
it shouldn't have happened.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.360
AUDIENCE: The artwork
angle is larger than the--

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.190
larger than the angle coming--

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.670
going from the say--

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.420
I mean if you take like a
z, the angle relationship

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.495
between this one and the one--

00:43:14.495 --> 00:43:16.080
PROFESSOR: This
one and this one.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.470
AUDIENCE: --and the one
coming from the object

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:23.370
to the first focal point.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.420
So this angle is a larger
than the array coming--

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.640
larger than the
one from the goes

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.600
to the first focal point, which
means that if you backtrack.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.310
PROFESSOR: This
is my handwriting.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.450
This is my handwriting.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.320
I see.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.460
OK.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.100
PROFESSOR: I forced it in
order to make them eat.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.390
I did not make a good diagram.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.890
I'm sorry.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:48.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.150
I see.

00:43:56.275 --> 00:43:57.217
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:58.300
I'm not very good drafter.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.800
I'm sorry.

00:44:02.428 --> 00:44:03.220
How do you call it?

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.170
Draftsman, right?

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.765
I'm not a very good draftsman.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.675
OK.

00:44:14.675 --> 00:44:17.700
So I don't want to
dwell on this too much.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.360
But this is basically--

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:26.650
we already discussed this idea
that pretty much the only case

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.190
where you form a real image
that is the rays actually

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:37.130
do meet at the image point, is
when you have a positive lens

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:42.600
and you place the object to the
left of the front focal point

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.200
of that lens.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.330
That will form a real element.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.760
All the other combinations,
they actually form

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.940
virtual images, which means
that what is coming out

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.640
of the system is a divergent
ray, a divergent ray bundle.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.630
Therefore they
don't really meet.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.720
But they do meet if you
extend them backwards.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.750
And this backwards
intersection is

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:07.313
what we call the virtual image.

00:45:07.313 --> 00:45:09.230
And you can see there
is different cases here.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.050
Sometimes the magnification
is bigger than one.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.060
Sometimes it is less than one.

00:45:16.892 --> 00:45:18.350
These actually,
can never remember.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.630
Every time I have to
derive which is the case.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.310
But anyway, all
the possibilities

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.070
can happen except, of
course, for this one

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.810
where the magnification
is always negative.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.110
It is always inverted.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.580
In the virtual image, the
magnification [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.930
it is always positive.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.220
It is very much is erect.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:37.720
OK?

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.620
Any questions about this?

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.890
Real and virtual images.

00:46:03.287 --> 00:46:05.120
And the last thing I
wanted to remind you of

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.200
is what we did on
Monday actually.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:13.770
The definitions of aperture
stops pupils, windows,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.500
[INAUDIBLE] and margin inlays.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.050
I really don't feel like going
through all this over again.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.792
This is probably very
fresh in your minds.

00:46:25.792 --> 00:46:27.750
So are there any questions
for Monday's lecture

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.060
that I can answer about this?

00:46:38.098 --> 00:46:41.170
AUDIENCE: The term vignetting
applies to the case

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.250
when the numerical aperture
changes over the field of view.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.250
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.420
So to exaggerate
it, suppose that you

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.690
have an optical system
where on access you

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.820
get a large acceptance angle.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.880
But then somehow
when you go off axis,

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.940
the acceptance angle
becomes very small.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.280
So now you compare
this with this.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.550
Clearly, this is smaller.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:07.678
That is vignetting.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.450
AUDIENCE: And that would mean--

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.830
would that be independent
of placing an aperture stop

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.545
at the focal plane of the lens?

00:47:22.184 --> 00:47:24.145
PROFESSOR: What you can
say about vignetting

00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:25.520
is that it generally
happens when

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.980
you place the aperture
stop in the wrong place.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.400
AUDIENCE: In the
wrong place, OK.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:29.900
OK.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.310
PROFESSOR: When a properly
designed optical system,

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.300
it should not happen,
yeah, at least if there's

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.580
a way to get around it.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:43.720
If you construct the optical
system in a way that you cannot

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.510
place the aperture stop then
that's a badly designed optical

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.810
system.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.540
So you generally
you try to avoid it

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.185
by placing your stops
in a strategic location.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.150
There's no universal
rule that says

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.850
you have to place the
aperture stop there in order

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.580
to avoid the vignette It
kind of depends if you

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.260
have a multi-element system.

00:48:15.565 --> 00:48:24.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
If you always make sure

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.850
that we place the aperture stop
at the effective focal plane,

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.310
then the vignetting
doesn't happen?

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:35.268
Because the rays coming
at any angle will--

00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:38.100
PROFESSOR: That is true for
the case of a telescope.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.080
I'm not sure if it is true
for a general optical system.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.720
Yeah, for a telescope
where if you place it

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.790
at the common focal point,
then yes, you have--

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.040
you minimize vignetting, yeah.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.950
OK.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:07.492
Before we break, let me go
over what we will do today.

00:49:07.492 --> 00:49:10.970
So today we have two items
in the agenda, basically.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:14.000
One of them is mirrors.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.390
So far with that with
spherical refractive

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.480
dielectric interfaces
whenever I said anything

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.560
about kind of reflective
surfaces, like mirrors.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.920
So we'll do that very briefly.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.160
It is simply all we
need is a modification

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.040
of the sine conventions
and we're done.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.363
So that's a fairly
painless topic.

00:49:38.363 --> 00:49:40.030
There's a little bit
of terminology here

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:41.668
which being Greek--

00:49:41.668 --> 00:49:43.710
actually I don't know if
being Greek makes sense.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.060
These are archaic words.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.830
Even in Greek, we
don't use them anymore.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:53.710
But a system that uses
mirrors is called catoptric,

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:54.520
from the Greek--

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.590
from the ancient
Greek word for mirror.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.890
And then if it uses only
refractive elements,

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.090
you call it dioptic.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.550
That's also where the
term diopter comes from.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.680
And finally, there is a
class of optical systems

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.940
that use both mirrors and
refractive lenses that

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:16.780
are very popular in two areas
in astronomy and lithography.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.940
In particular, lithography.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.480
If any of you have dealt with
semiconductor lithography,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.580
semiconductor industry where
they make these huge machines

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:30.710
that write on--

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.580
write patterns on silicon
to make chips and such.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.600
For example, [INAUDIBLE]
for his project when he does

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.440
lithography.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.600
Typically, these
machines, they contain--

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.463
the optics are probably
taller than me.

00:50:43.463 --> 00:50:44.380
OK, I'm not that tall.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.530
But anyway, they are taller
than a basketball player.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:52.180
And they contain typically
between 20 and 30 elements.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:57.432
Some of those are mirrors some
of those are refractive lenses.

00:50:57.432 --> 00:50:59.140
So this type of system
that contains both

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.820
is called catadioptric.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.843
That's a mouthful.

00:51:01.843 --> 00:51:03.010
But that's what it's called.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:06.330
So there will see some
examples of such systems.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:10.600
And we'll see them in the
context of the basic imaging

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:16.330
systems that is the magnifier
lens, the eyepiece which

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.480
is basically a magnifier,
then the microscope

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.850
uses actually two magnifiers--

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:26.080
the telescope which is a
slightly strange magnifier.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.980
And finally, we'll see
different types of telescope.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:35.785
Where is Le?

00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:36.285
Le?

00:51:36.285 --> 00:51:38.212
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:38.212 --> 00:51:40.170
PROFESSOR: This is the
answer to your question.

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:44.910
While you guys took a break,
I drew again a careful diagram

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.680
with the ray that you asked.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.390
So now you see so
the red rays are

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.060
the ray traces for the case
where the lens is positive.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:59.100
But the second principal
plane is to the left.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.990
And the black lines are
the rays that go to the--

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:07.438
that intersect the
principal planes on axis.

00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:08.980
So you have to be
a bit careful here.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.105
And I've got to take myself
actually the first time

00:52:11.105 --> 00:52:11.890
I did it.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.730
That they-- when you
depart from here,

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.160
you have to meet the
first principal plane

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.890
at this center of the axis.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.810
And then you start from
the second principal plane.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.740
And you're drawing
to the image point.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.940
And you can see there
the two black lines,

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.184
they do look sort of
parallel, don't they?

00:52:29.184 --> 00:52:30.108
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:52:30.108 --> 00:52:32.237
Yeah.

00:52:32.237 --> 00:52:34.070
PROFESSOR: And of course,
the image is here.

00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:44.891
AUDIENCE: Actually
it's a similar thing

00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:47.346
but I think it's wrong.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:53.200
PROFESSOR: Yes,
they are similar.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.420
It's a little bit
difficult to see here.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.830
It is obvious that
they're similar if you

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:57.300
do the case of the single lens.

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.090
Remember this diagram?

00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:09.230
That's a really bad drawing.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.710
But from here you can see that
they're similar triangles.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.210
Right?

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.202
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.920
PROFESSOR: And then,
of course, when

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.410
you put the principal
planes, there's

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.200
just dead space between
the two principal planes.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.882
But the geometrical
relationships

00:53:24.882 --> 00:53:26.590
are similar triangles
and all that stuff,

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.620
they get presented except
you are dead space.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.680
And in this example,
it is even worse.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.550
The dead space is
kind of reversed.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.940
Because they moved one principal
plane on top of the other.

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.258
You know what I mean.

00:53:38.258 --> 00:53:40.800
I think if I attempt to express
it, I will confuse the issue.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.680
Let me talk a little
bit about mirrors now.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.600
So for mirrors, wherever
set of the same conventions

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.640
that is a little bit
modified with respect

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.260
to the same conventions
for refraction.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.780
And the reason, of course, is
that when you have a reflective

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.570
surface then the
rays will indeed fall

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:15.460
and they will start going
from the right to the left.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.320
So because of that
fact, then we really

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.570
have to modify our
sign conventions.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:27.350
And here I put all the cases
of positive quantities.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.220
So most of these are familiar.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.550
The positive curvature
is the same as before.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.820
These angles and directions
here are the same as before.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.330
The really interesting
ones, the ones

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.790
that happen upon the reflection.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:43.740
Because upon
reflection, the distance

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.820
has now become positive
if they go to their right

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.220
not to the left.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.600
And that kind of
makes intuitive sense.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.780
Because now it is as
if actually the best

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.380
way to make sense of this
is to simply unfold it.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.380
So if you want to take this--

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.580
the part of what happened
after reflection,

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:05.840
and then found it so it could
go back for one direction.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.280
Then these quantities would then
would indeed remain positive.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.770
So this is the origin
of the sine conventions

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.110
for the mirrors.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.180
So for example, why is
this angle positive?

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.560
Well, because if I
flip it the other value

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:24.650
down it would indeed be the same
as a positive angle over here.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.170
Of course, this angle,
if it had happened

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:30.350
in a refractive system,
that would have been--

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.030
well, it would
have been forbidden

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.380
to begin with because the ray
is going from right to left.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.760
And that's anathema.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:44.360
So having said that,
I'll come back to this.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.780
But having said that, the
next thing we would like to do

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:53.580
is derive a matrix
relationship for mirrors.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.580
Now long time ago,
I think it was

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.120
in the first or
second lecture or so,

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.690
we derived the ideal mirror.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:06.260
We said that if you have
rays coming from infinity

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.630
and you want to focus
them onto a single point

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:19.890
out here, like so, we
said that the way you

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:23.970
do that is with a surface,
reflective surface.

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:27.480
And you remember, probably,
that what the surface was.

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.940
It was a parabola.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:33.360
So we wrote it in
equations here.

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.980
If you call this elevation
s, you call this axis x.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.720
So we found the
equation of the parabola

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.630
was s equals x squared
over 4F, where F is

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:46.920
the focal length of the lens.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:54.010
So the parabola is ideal.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.940
But in some cases, people
make spherical mirrors.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.490
Actually, it is not
as common as lenses.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.470
Lenses are very
commonly spherical.

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.020
Mirrors are very often actually
paraboloidal, very close

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:11.830
to ideal, especially mirrors
used in concentrators, things

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:17.050
like satellite antennas,
solar concentrations that

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:21.910
are used in solar energy
systems and so on.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.850
Then, because they
would want to focus

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:28.030
the light on a single
point then you actually

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.740
go for the parabola.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.530
It turns out, if you want to
form a sort of a bigger image

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.450
here than the parabola
is not very good.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.120
So people actually
make spherical mirrors.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.070
So for a spherical
mirror, I did a little bit

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:46.160
of a derivation here
which basically follows

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.920
the paraxial
approximation to connect

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.490
the ideal parabolic shape
and the focal length

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:57.840
that we get from the parabola
to the equivalent sphere.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.230
And again, the parabola
and the sphere, they

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.550
kind of look the same.

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:04.950
If you look at the parabola,
maybe it goes like this.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:07.460
If you look at the
sphere, and you

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.430
match the curvatures near the
center, it might go like this.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.360
So what we're
trying to find here,

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.690
what is the radius
of this sphere here

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.860
that matches best the
parabola, the ideal parabola.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.510
So this is the ideal parabola
that is given by this equation.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:33.677
And then here's the sphere.

00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:35.260
That's not a very
good looking sphere.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.600
But anyway, let's
call it a sphere.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.820
And the question is,
what is the radius

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.640
of curvature of this
sphere that will

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.880
match the parabola ideally.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.500
So this is what I did here.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.760
If you write the
equation for the sphere,

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.180
well, we know-- actually,
let me leave this up.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.180
We know how to read the
question for the sphere.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.000
In my chosen system of
coordinates, this is x.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.910
And this is the positive axis z.

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:04.750
So the equation for the
sphere is x plus the radius,

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:11.753
squared plus s squared
equals the radius squared.

00:59:11.753 --> 00:59:13.420
So this is the question
for this sphere.

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.930
This is this displacement here,
with respect to the center

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.300
of the coordinates.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.400
And then what do you
do, this is [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.410
slide but I will
actually derive it

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:27.070
for you here so you can see it
in this sort of animated form.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.690
And then what you
do is you actually

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:37.555
solve, so you have an s
equals plus/minus R minus--

00:59:40.493 --> 00:59:41.160
what am I doing?

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.090
AUDIENCE: So you've got
your axis-- your [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:46.160
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.490
Yes, I did.

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.990
Didn't I?

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.380
Yay.

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.255
I'm sorry about that.

00:59:51.492 --> 00:59:53.440
I think I better do this over.

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:12.010
So this is s for the parabola.

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:13.670
This is s for the sphere.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:29.050
So of course it would be s
plus R squared plus x squared

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:31.240
equals R squared.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.760
So that means that s equals
minus R plus minus square root

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.440
R squared minus x squared.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.860
Now which signs would I
keep, the plus or the minus?

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:49.610
Well, the minus sign, you can
see a little bit by inspection,

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:53.060
the minus sign is this
part of the sphere which

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.260
is pretty far from the paraxial
approximation, clearly, right?

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.660
So the only way to deal with
a paraxial approximation

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.400
is to keep the plus sign.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.440
So we'll write, then, s equals
minus R plus the next step you

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.300
do to derive paraxial
approximations

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.500
is you pull a large quantity
out of the square root.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.365
So the large quantities,
the radius here,

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:16.490
and you write it like this.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.330
1 minus x squared
over R squared.

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:23.880
Then you apply a Taylor formula
that says that square root of 1

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:31.250
plus small approximately equals
1 plus the small divided by 2.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.870
And note, of course,
that applies also

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:34.790
for a negative sign.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.210
So I can do like this.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:44.600
And this means that s equals
minus R plus R 1 minus x

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.330
square over 2R squared.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.550
And if you do it
carefully here you

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.710
see that this kills the square.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:53.420
This kills this.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:02:05.630
And you end up with s equals
minus x squared over 2R.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.340
And what this means now is
if you compare with equation

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:12.770
of the ideal parabola,
which was x squared over 4F,

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:17.000
it means that F
equals minus R over 2.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.220
The next question now
is what does this mean.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.610
Is the focal length
negative or positive?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.090
To answer this question,
we have to first remember

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.830
our sign conventions.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.350
Is our surface
positive or negative?

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:40.210
That is, is R a negative
or positive quantity?

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:45.090
So if you recall, I'll go back
one slide to the previous one.

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.640
This is a positive curvature.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.180
if If it is pointing that way,
I will not use any formal term

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.560
because that may be confusing.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.890
If it's like that,
it's positive.

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:58.000
This is not like that.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:58.850
It's the opposite.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:02.530
And so therefore
here, R is negative.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.770
So you have a negative sign
that came out of the math.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.140
But R is a negative quantity.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.750
So therefore F is
still positive.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.430
So this is still
a positive lens.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.800
And it is clear that
it is a positive lens,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.010
because it forms a real image
for an object at infinity.

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:30.940
By construction, we demanded
that if I have parallel rays

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.780
from infinity, these
things should focus them

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.350
to a real point on the axis.

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.450
So therefore,
clearly, this is what

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:41.230
you would call a positive lens.

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.690
And since the lens,
it actually has

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:47.230
a matrix that is very similar
to the matrix of a lens,

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.560
all you have to do is
substitute the focal length

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.540
with the equation
that we just derived

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.180
for the radius of curvature.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:00.640
And this is the matrix that
describes a mirror, a mirror

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.510
concentrator.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:06.500
And of course, since it is a
lens, it also forms images.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.920
So notice here,
the way I drew it,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.200
these quantities are
still all positive.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.290
Of course, it's not as positive
because I go from the object

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:23.620
to the right, towards
the instrument.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.700
Now notice what happens.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.930
From the instrument, I go to
the left towards the image.

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:30.640
But that is still
a positive quantity

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.520
because there was a reflection
that occurred there.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.780
So therefore s sub I is
still a positive quantity.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.570
So I can write this equation
with a clear conscience,

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:48.350
so to speak, that s0 and si
are all positive qualities.

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:53.150
Now can you imagine when a lens
might form a virtual image?

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:56.335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:56.335 --> 01:04:57.320
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.520
Yes, a mirror.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.870
So clearly the mirror here
is forming a real image.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:06.150
Can you imagine how I could
construct a mirror forming

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.360
a virtual image?

01:05:16.724 --> 01:05:19.340
AUDIENCE: If the mirror
diverges and you are looking

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.010
from the same side, then.

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:22.010
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.850
That's one way.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:25.640
If you make the
mirror like this,

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.490
now the mirror has a
positive R therefore

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:31.430
it has a negative
F. Now this mirror

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:33.980
has become the equivalent
of a negative lens.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.470
Therefore it will
form a virtual image.

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.420
What's another possibility
for forming a virtual image

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.170
with a mirror?

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:46.150
What about a positive lens?

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.546
Could a positive lens
ever form a virtual image?

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:50.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:50.482 --> 01:05:51.820
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.570
If you put the object in
between the focal point

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.643
and the mirror itself, again,
it will form a virtual image.

01:05:59.643 --> 01:06:01.810
That's actually a very funny
to observe by yourself.

01:06:04.997 --> 01:06:07.330
You cannot quite do it with
a spoon because the spoon is

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:07.960
really too small.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.127
You have to go really close.

01:06:09.127 --> 01:06:11.230
And you cannot focus
your eyes in there.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:14.590
But those of you
who've been at hotels--

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.010
I've never seen this in a home.

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:20.350
But most hotels, in the bathroom
they have a curved mirror.

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:21.880
And I don't want
to speculate why

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.350
they put that curved mirror,
there but anyway they have it.

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:26.280
And this mirror is
very lightly curved.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.990
It has a very long
radius of curvature.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:32.530
So it is very easy,
actually, if you

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:35.530
stand in front of the mirror,
you can move back and forth.

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.880
And you can switch your
image from real to virtual.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.040
It is really spectacular.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.450
It is worth checking yourself
in the Ritz Carlton in Boston

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.270
spend $400 for a night
just to see that, actually.

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:49.300
Because it's very, very
instructive from the optics

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.130
point of view.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.530
But real, it's nice, because
as you go near the mirror,

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:56.200
basically when you get
between the focal length

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.680
and the mirror, then you see
an erect image of yourself that

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.990
is virtual because you see
yourself behind the mirror

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.060
it is magnified.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.500
Actually, the
magnification is so high

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.210
that you typically
only see your eye.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:08.710
But anyway, something like that.

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:13.240
If you move back, then
you see yourself inverted,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.360
as you see yourself in
a spoon, by the way.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.990
If you look at
yourself in a spoon

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.020
you almost always see yourself
inverted because the spoon has

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.410
a very short focal length.

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:23.530
So you are always
in this scenario

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:24.590
when you look at a spoon.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.350
Any questions?

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.190
There's not much else to
say about mirrors really.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:48.580
The same optics applies,
with this little twist

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.160
of the flipping of the
signs upon inversion.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.800
So if you face a situation, all
you need to do is keep cool.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.110
Don't let yourself
panic or anything.

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.560
It's just a matter
of keeping track

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.660
of the positive things that
happen to the right or to the--

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.770
I'm sorry-- to the
[INAUDIBLE] things

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.020
that happen after reflection.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.880
And typically with
the kind of problems

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.850
that we have to solve by
hand, these are pretty simple.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.130
I mean at most, you might
encounter one reflection.

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:20.920
Now people who make
optical design software,

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.272
they have to deal with arbitrary
numbers of reflections.

01:08:23.272 --> 01:08:24.939
I wouldn't want to
be the programmer who

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:27.939
has to solve that problem.

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:30.160
Because you know, if you
have a second reflection,

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.630
then the signs flip again.

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:34.170
As you can imagine, if I
stick another mirror here.

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.950
So the light starts
sort of zig zagging,

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:41.520
every reflection flips the signs
in the sign convention again.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.810
So it can get a bit
tricky to keep track

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:45.609
of all of these flippings.

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:48.670
But we don't have
to worry about that

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:52.096
at this introductory level.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:02.640
So let me move onto
the next topic, which

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.725
is a few examples
of optical systems.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.314
AUDIENCE: Hey, George.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:08.939
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.147
AUDIENCE: Sorry to interrupt.

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:12.920
I'm going to pass around
these parabolic reflecters

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.260
so you can try that.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.279
PROFESSOR: Good idea.

01:09:17.564 --> 01:09:19.689
So maybe you don't have to
go to a hotel after all.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:22.540
[INAUDIBLE] What is the focal
length of this, you know?

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.300
AUDIENCE: It's like
20 centimeters or so.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.220
You can check it out.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.000
PROFESSOR: Great.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.646
So yeah, you try to go
at 40 and 10 or whatever,

01:09:31.646 --> 01:09:32.979
and you will see the difference.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:35.083
It's actually quite dramatic
and very interesting.

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:47.819
So the magnifier, as
the name suggests,

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:52.300
it is a device that we use
to aid our eyes when we're

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.330
looking at a very small object.

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:59.147
And this is a--

01:09:59.147 --> 01:10:01.230
dog it took me a lot of
time to make this cartoon.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.230
So I'm very proud of it.

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:04.700
So let me start
the animation here.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.980
So if you have a really
small object, of course

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.580
it will form a very small
image on your retina.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.030
And very often,
this image is not

01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:19.582
big enough to observe
with sufficient detail.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.040
So the obvious
thing that you would

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.780
do if something
looks small to you

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.843
and you'd like to
make it bigger,

01:10:24.843 --> 01:10:26.260
you don't have to
know any optics.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.295
What you do is you
bring it near your eyes.

01:10:28.295 --> 01:10:29.920
But from experience,
you know that this

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.940
doesn't work very well.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.680
Because if you
exceed the distance

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.980
of approximately 25
centimeters, then you

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.780
can really not focus anymore.

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.320
And actually for you
guys who are young

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.730
it's about 25 centimeters.

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:46.090
As we grow older, this distance
becomes longer and longer.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.530
And we basically
lose our ability

01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:49.840
to focus, which is a very
annoying, annoying thing

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.440
actually.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.130
It has just started
to happen to me.

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:55.840
As I approach age 40, I've
started noticing that I cannot

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.920
focus as well as I used to.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.190
So it's a little bit annoying.

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.800
But anyway it beats the
alternative I guess.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.550
So I'm very happy that
I reached that age.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:09.160
But anyway, the point is
that there comes a point--

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.140
actually for me now,
the only way to focus

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.600
is to take off my glasses.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.847
But even so, there
comes a point where

01:11:15.847 --> 01:11:16.930
you can not focus anymore.

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:17.980
Even you cannot focus.

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.790
I bring something to 5 or 10
centimeters, you cannot focus.

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:23.900
The question is,
what could you do.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.905
So what you do is
you use a magnifier.

01:11:25.905 --> 01:11:27.610
And the magnifier is
something that you

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.820
put between the
object and your eye.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.340
And the way it
works is like this.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.350
We can do some simple
ray tracing here.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:40.500
This is where the
parameters of the magnifier,

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.760
let's say it is a positive
lens, the magnifier.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.750
Let's say the focal
length is F and the power

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.560
is the inverse of that.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.530
So this is some ray tracing
that shows how the image is

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.120
formed by this lens.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.730
So all you do is you
take a horizontal ray.

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.450
This will go somehow through--

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.330
this guy will bend it.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:06.770
And let's pretend now that
this ray, somehow I tune things

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.740
so that this ray went through
the center of the eye.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.770
So this ray went
and bend, right?

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.620
But you can see very clearly
now because what these lines did

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.290
is it bent this ray
bundle so that it

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:20.030
meets the object over here.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:25.160
The result is that I got a much
magnified image on the retina.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:25.980
That's about it.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.460
That's all there is to.

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.860
By using this element,
you can get bigger images.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.540
Now if I didn't
have the eye here,

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.410
this is actually the
most instructive thing

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:39.790
I'm going to say today.

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:42.880
This is really the meaning
of the virtual image.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.870
If I give you this system
by itself, obviously

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.040
because this lens, if
you look carefully,

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.740
it created a
divergent ray bundle.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.830
Obviously this object is between
the focal point of the lens.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.330
So therefore, this
is the situation

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.070
that we encountered before.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:03.370
And we've said that the
system forms a virtual image.

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:05.230
Well what is the virtual image?

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.450
I have to take these rays
that the lens produced

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:09.880
and I have to extend
them backwards.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.590
And with a little
bit of manipulation

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:15.210
here, because this is a cartoon,
it is not a real calculation.

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.840
But with some
manipulation, I made sure

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.220
that the rays do meet.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.460
So the rays meet.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:23.020
And the point where the rays
meet is the virtual image.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.880
There's nothing there.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.540
Nothing.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.530
The object is here.

01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:29.410
The only physical entity
is here and your eye,

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:30.760
and the lens of course.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.900
There's nothing here.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:37.280
But when your eye
forms an image it

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.730
is as if you could
take this away--

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:43.070
you could take away the
combination of the object

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:48.410
and the magnifier and replace
it with a virtual image

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:50.660
that this system formed.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:57.550
This virtual element is acting
as an object for your eye.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.380
The eye images this object.

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.010
And because this object
has been magnified relative

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:08.930
to the actual object, you end
up observing a magnified image.

01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:11.080
So this is the significance
of virtual images.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.570
By themselves, that
don't mean anything.

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:17.080
But because at the end of an
optical system you always have

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.830
the observer's--

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.700
I mean, the
observer's eye length

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.570
and the retina,
the virtual image

01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:28.390
ends up becoming a real image,
hopefully on the retina.

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.698
If it becomes a real
image elsewhere,

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:31.990
you will not be able to see it.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:33.490
It will be out to focus.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.440
Or even worse, if you
create a virtual image

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.570
and you send it to an
observer so it becomes

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.430
a virtual image on
the retina, again you

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:40.472
don't see anything there.

01:14:40.472 --> 01:14:43.750
Because you can never
observe a virtual image

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.170
unless you can image it
using the optics of your eye.

01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:49.790
So this is the
significance then.

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:52.870
And we'll see in the second
that everything-- microscopes,

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:54.790
telescopes, magnifiers--

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:59.710
they all form of virtual images
which eventually the observer's

01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:02.640
eye lens converts to a
real image on the retina.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.770
The next thing that
we'll do now is

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:13.120
we'll put some math
around this topic.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.620
And this is a little
bit unfortunate

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.180
because the book is generally
very good, the textbook

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.050
that we have, Hecht.

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:22.180
I do think that in
this particular topic,

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.590
the textbook is a
little bit confusing.

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:27.610
So I'll try to walk you through
the derivation in the textbook

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:32.190
and hopefully I will
make it less confusing.

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:38.310
But if, when you go back home
and you read the textbook,

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:41.460
you confused again, please
bring your questions on Monday

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.730
so we can talk about this again.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.310
So I tried to make
it less confusing

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:50.070
but still I'm using the
notation in the book.

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:53.520
So you don't-- in addition
to the confusion in the book,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.200
you don't have to overcome
notational confusion.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.720
So the definition of the
magnifying power which cannot

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.810
be argued against because it is
a definition is it is the ratio

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:13.870
of the angle subtended by
the tip of the object before

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.610
and after magnification.

01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:19.570
Actually the subscript
here, U and A, U

01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:23.800
stands for Unaided, that is
the eye without the magnifier.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.930
And A stands for Aided.

01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:32.140
That is the eye with the
aid of the magnifier lens.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:40.280
And now we need to place symbols
to all of these distances here.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.530
And I think this is where
the book is a bit confusing.

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:44.780
Because it tries to
do everything at once.

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.030
But anyway, so I
need this symbol

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:50.290
for the distance between
the object of the lens.

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:53.760
Then I need the symbol
from the lens to the eye.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.230
And in the symbol from the lens
to the virtual image, which

01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:59.720
is of course si,
and in this case

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.400
you would expect
the side to turn out

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.340
to be a negative number,
because it is a virtual image.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.490
And finally you use the
symbol L for the distance

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:12.920
between the virtual
image and the eye.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.710
So L is, of course, that simply
the sum of these two distances

01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:18.300
with a proper sign convention.

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:26.130
The first thing to note
is that you don't really

01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:30.150
need all these notations
because the magnifying power is

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.790
very simple to calculate.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.300
As we did in the past,
all you have to do

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.000
is use similar triangles.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.820
Because you can see that
the magnifying power--

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:51.390
the angle a sub a,
the [INAUDIBLE] angle,

01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:57.490
equals the ratio of the size
of the virtual image over what?

01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:00.240
Look at the red line.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.317
From this ray angle,
over the big distance L.

01:18:04.317 --> 01:18:05.650
And of course there's a tangent.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.700
I should have a tangent there.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.200
But I dropped the
tangent because

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.330
of the paraxial approximation.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:16.210
Similarly for the
unaided eye, it

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:19.990
equals the ratio of the
natural height of the object

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:23.140
to the distance between
the object and the lens.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:28.150
Now for the unaided case, the
convention is to use the near

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:32.230
point of the eye, that is the
25 centimeter distance beyond

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:33.550
which the eye cannot focus.

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:35.770
Because presumably,
if you wanted

01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:39.232
to get the maximum possible
unaided magnification,

01:18:39.232 --> 01:18:40.690
you really have to
bring the object

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:43.780
within this 25 centimeters.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.880
So that's why we use d0.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.200
So that's a standard actually.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.600
It is 25 centimeters.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.350
And when you play
around with this,

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.830
you discover that it equals
the ratio of these two

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:57.140
distances, which is easy to do.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.150
And this is what
we used to call--

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:01.250
what did we call
this quantity when

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.730
we did the imaging condition?

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.570
Button.

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.060
AUDIENCE: Lateral magnification.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.060
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.730
This is what we used to call
the lateral magnification.

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:16.360
It is the ratio of
the size of the image

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.970
over the size of the object.

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:24.250
So this is what they say here.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.820
And of course this is the
lateral magnification.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.510
We have the questions
for it in terms

01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:30.760
of the image and distances.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.920
And we can substitute
these equations

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.450
and we can actually
derive a number

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:40.970
of equivalent expressions
for the magnifying power.

01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.870
So now, none of this is
particularly intuitive.

01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:46.210
And then the book goes
ahead and gives two

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:49.450
possible uses of
the magnifying lens

01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:52.750
that are not particularly
intuitive either.

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.130
So I will not even
bother to deal with them.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.800
One of them is when
you put the magnifier

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.380
one focal distance away.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.210
I don't know if it's
necessary to do that.

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.100
The other is when you
put the magnifier--

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.463
you stick it to your eye,
which is not a very good idea

01:20:10.463 --> 01:20:11.880
because there's
all kinds of germs

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.710
around so you don't
want to stick magnifiers

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:17.200
onto your body.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.760
The way we use
magnifiers in general

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.960
is the number three
description of the book, which

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.690
is why we place the
object at one focal point

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:29.640
behind the magnifier.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.228
So if the magnifying focal
length is 5 centimeters--

01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:35.520
actually, that's a pretty long.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.240
But anyway, you place it 5
centimeters from the object.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.120
What do you accomplish this way?

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.260
What happens if you place an
object at one focal distance

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.370
in front of the lens.

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:49.210
That's right.

01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:50.680
You form an image at infinity.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.950
Actually, in that case, you
form a real image with infinity.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:54.950
Now is that good or bad?

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:02.640
In the context here, you
form the image with infinity

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.810
and you still have an
observer with his or her eye

01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:07.680
lens and the retina.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:11.980
Let me draw this.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.190
Now we draw the specific case,
according to the book lingo,

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:25.140
this is case number
three, si equals F.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.380
So what does it look like?

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.600
Here's my magnifier.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:36.110
Here is my eye lens.

01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:38.982
And of course the eye
kind of looks like this.

01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:39.940
And this is the retina.

01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:48.490
And here is the optical axis.

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:51.825
And here is the object.

01:21:51.825 --> 01:21:53.450
So let's look at the
tip of the object.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:59.000
Since it is one focal
distance away from the lens

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.225
I will get a
parallel ray bundle.

01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:07.240
Is that good or bad?

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.980
AUDIENCE: It's s0
equals F, right?

01:22:12.144 --> 01:22:12.890
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:13.390
Thank you.

01:22:19.792 --> 01:22:20.750
So is that good or bad?

01:22:23.516 --> 01:22:26.995
AUDIENCE: If we talk of
aberrations, it's good.

01:22:26.995 --> 01:22:27.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:30.100
Let's not go into aberrations.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.040
In our simple
geometrical optics,

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.140
is that situation happy?

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.012
Are we happy that we did this?

01:22:37.012 --> 01:22:39.115
We're happy for a
number of reasons.

01:22:39.115 --> 01:22:40.000
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.380
Because it will perfectly
focus at the point.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.380
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:49.340
First of all, this is assumed
to be a corrected eye.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:55.710
So if it was me, that would
be me wearing my eyeglasses.

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.020
If it is me without my
eyeglasses, I have a problem.

01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.980
You'll see in a
second what problem.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:06.135
But if it is a
healthy eyesight where

01:23:06.135 --> 01:23:08.010
the eye can focus
perfectly, then this indeed

01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:09.420
will form an image
on the retina.

01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:17.130
What is the other good
news about this situation?

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:19.740
The fact that the
image is at infinity,

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:20.990
is this good news or bad news?

01:23:26.138 --> 01:23:27.990
AUDIENCE: Your eyes remain--

01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:29.925
your eye remains unaccommodated.

01:23:29.925 --> 01:23:31.920
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.150
We learned that the eye is
most relaxed when it observes

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:39.790
remote objects at infinity.

01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:42.330
The reason it cannot focus
closer is because I have

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:44.690
to strain the lens of my eye.

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:49.140
And as I get older, my ability
to strain it diminishes.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.888
But this is true for
everybody, young or old.

01:23:51.888 --> 01:23:53.680
When you try to look
at something close by,

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.260
you get tired.

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:58.080
If you read a book like
this, your parents probably

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.080
told you-- they told me.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.247
Don't read the book like
this, you get the headache.

01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:02.080
And indeed you do.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.300
If you read for a long time you
get a headache from very close.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.970
So the reason this
is a happy situation

01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:12.180
is because the eye
can be totally relaxed

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:15.650
as if it was observing
something very far away

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:19.940
and still see the object
with magnification.

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.800
And how much is
the magnification?

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.240
Well, we'll skip the math.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.850
The math is fairly simple here.

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.960
But it turns out to be simply
the product of the near point,

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.670
the 25 centimeters, times
their power of the lens.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:37.010
And the only penalty
you pay, the reason,

01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:39.670
actually, the book covers
this case over here

01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:42.440
is because this is not the
maximum magnification you

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.090
can get with a magnifier.

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:47.550
You can get slightly higher
if you stick the magnifier

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:48.270
next to your eye.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.170
But you never stick the
magnifier to your eye,

01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:53.740
actually.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.524
Unless you're adventurous.

01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.960
If I did this, I would
damage my glasses.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.760
So the message,
perhaps, important.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.800
But what I really hope
that you get out of this

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.280
is the significance
of the virtual image

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:21.600
and why the magnifier functions
by forming a virtual image that

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.940
is erect and magnified.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:28.880
And this also tells you why
you will use a positive lens

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.410
as a magnifier.

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:33.610
If you recall, it is actually
one of the previous slides.

01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:35.870
A negative lens also
forms a virtual image.

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:38.740
But unfortunately,
it is not magnified.

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.570
The magnification,
it is de-magnified.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:44.110
The lateral magnification
is less than 1.

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.280
So we would be out
of luck in this case.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.000
The next element is
actually the same.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.270
It is no different
than the magnifier.

01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:08.060
But it comes under
the name eyepiece

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:13.640
because in optical instruments
such as binoculars, telescopes,

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.680
microscopes, and the like
this is the last lens

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.840
that you look into the
instrument with your naked eye.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.410
Now I realize that this
is old fashioned talk.

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:31.640
Modern instruments, you seldom
look at with a naked eye.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.500
You actually have a camera.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.050
So you put a digital camera
and you register the image

01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:37.070
digitally.

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.670
However, even a digital camera
functions like a retina.

01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:41.810
So in other words,
even a digital camera

01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:45.140
would have an eyepiece
and then a condenser.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.760
And then it would
go onto the chip.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.950
So really the situation here
applies to digital imaging

01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:56.540
as well as human, as
well as instruments

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.820
meant to be used by humans.

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:06.150
So the eyepiece is basically the
last element in the instrument,

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:12.710
just before you get to the
actual observation stage.

01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:16.580
And because the eyepieces
were traditionally

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:20.180
designed for the humans,
they are typically

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.100
designed like a magnifier
with the same principle

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:27.300
that I described before that
forms an image of infinity.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.900
So therefore the
observer, when he or she

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:35.510
looks into the eyepiece, they
can use an unaccommodated eye

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:40.010
and observe the magnified
image without having

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:42.110
to strain their eyes.

01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:48.980
So this is the sort of
standard use of an eyepiece.

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:54.350
And there's a second condition
for the eyepiece which

01:27:54.350 --> 01:28:02.750
will become a little bit more
apparent in the next slide

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:05.000
when I talk about
the microscope.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.290
It is this one over here.

01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:10.330
This looks a little bit cryptic.

01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:13.810
It says the center of
the exit pupil eyepoint

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:17.957
where the observer's eye
is placed at 10 millimeters

01:28:17.957 --> 01:28:18.790
from the instrument.

01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:19.748
This doesn't mean much.

01:28:19.748 --> 01:28:23.260
But I will describe what
this means in a second, when

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.520
I talk about the microscope.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.600
Not withstanding this last
point over here, any questions

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.328
about the eyepiece or
the magnifier or anything

01:28:31.328 --> 01:28:31.870
of that sort?

01:28:41.156 --> 01:28:44.780
AUDIENCE: Why is the eye
[INAUDIBLE] 10 millimeter when

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.620
we cannot see?

01:28:47.877 --> 01:28:48.460
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.290
What this really means is that
10 millimeters is the design

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:55.420
distance that you're supposed
to place your eyes with respect

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.340
to the instrument.

01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.087
When you look at the microscope,
for example, most people

01:29:00.087 --> 01:29:00.670
don't do that.

01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:02.950
But you're supposed to be
at about 10 centimeters

01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:06.430
from the last surface, right?

01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:10.030
So that is called
the eye relief.

01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:13.660
And what this is really saying
is that when you look at this,

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:19.540
you're not supposed to see
any blockage of the image.

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.452
And you're not supposed
to see vignetting.

01:29:22.452 --> 01:29:23.910
There's two things
that can happen.

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:26.202
If you place your eye at the
wrong point-- as you know,

01:29:26.202 --> 01:29:28.340
if any of you have
looked at a microscope,

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.380
if you are not positioned
properly you cannot see

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.460
the entire field of view.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.360
That's one problem.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.412
You see a black hole.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:36.870
And you kind of
have to move around

01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:38.550
and you can never see
anything until you

01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:41.847
go to the proper place and then
finally you see everything.

01:29:41.847 --> 01:29:42.930
So this is the eye relief.

01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:45.927
This is by design where
you should place your eye.

01:29:45.927 --> 01:29:47.760
The other thing that
can happen if you place

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.220
your eye at the wrong place
or if the microscope is not

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.200
properly designed is vignetting.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.080
So this requirement
clearly assures

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.210
that there's no vignetting
when your eye is placed

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:01.950
at eye relief distance,
that is at 10 millimeters

01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:03.090
from the instrument.

01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:04.020
And of course, you
don't have to worry

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:06.660
about focusing because the
microscope is supposed to have

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.130
infinite conjugate, right?

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:11.790
So you just use with
an accommodated eye.

01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.857
And I suspect, I don't
know if it's true,

01:30:13.857 --> 01:30:16.190
but I suspect-- there are
many reasons why they put over

01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:16.670
there.

01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:18.837
But also, it's kind of
convenient that when you look

01:30:18.837 --> 01:30:21.830
at the microscope you're so
close to the microscope tube

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:24.360
itself that you cannot focus
and you cannot see that.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.860
So you can basically
see what you're

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.318
supposed to observe but you
don't see the actual instrument

01:30:28.318 --> 01:30:29.730
because it is out of focus.

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:30.965
So that's kind of convenient.

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.480
So [INAUDIBLE] this
about the microscope.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.730
Here is a microscope.

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:39.340
Here's what it looks like.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:40.440
It is deceptively simple.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.620
Because there's, of course,
a lot of engineering design

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.410
that goes into making
all of these elements.

01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:48.420
But the principle is
surprisingly simple.

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.180
It consists of basically
two magnifiers.

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.840
One of them is called objective.

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.230
The other is called eyepiece.

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:58.650
But they both function
as magnifiers.

01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:02.710
So the job of the objective,
this is the first lens.

01:31:02.710 --> 01:31:06.390
It is called objective because
it is placed near the object.

01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:12.120
And its job is basically to
form an intermediate image that

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.550
is magnified to begin with.

01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:15.990
What is it magnified by?

01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:19.020
Well, here we simply have--

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.670
actually this is a real image.

01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:23.980
So we simply have a positive
lens forming a real image.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.100
We can compute
the magnification.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:34.340
It is equal to minus si over s0,
just like the regular formula.

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:39.170
And then we have the
eyepiece for which

01:31:39.170 --> 01:31:44.000
the image that the objective
produced actually now

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.980
acts as the object.

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.180
So this intermediate image
is re-imaged by the eyepiece.

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:52.980
But the eyepiece is
placed one focal distance.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.960
F sub e here is the focal
length of the eyepiece.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.530
It is one focal distance
from that intermediate image.

01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:06.310
And therefore the final
image is formed at infinity.

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:12.370
Now the way this is
drawn for this one, what

01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:16.480
is prominent in this picture
is, of course, the on-axis ray.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.330
And there's no
magnification to talk about

01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:20.830
because this is just an axis.

01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:22.270
Nothing interesting
is happening.

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.770
What is really
interesting is if you

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:26.680
look at an off-axis point,
which is at the bottom here.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.650
It's a little bit
difficult to see.

01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.882
It looks better in
the book actually.

01:32:30.882 --> 01:32:34.200
So if you trace
this off-axis point,

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.330
then you find that
its final image

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:40.860
is this ray bundle
that is coming off-axis

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:44.820
into your eye,
this parallel ray.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.020
That is the final image
of the microscope produced

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.580
of this off-axis
objective point.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.700
You can see it has entered
the eye at a very large angle.

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.120
Therefore it will
form a big image.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.632
So that's how the microscope
magnifies small objects

01:32:59.632 --> 01:33:00.840
so that you can observe them.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:09.490
So then the magnification
of the microscope,

01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:11.860
very similar to the
case of the objective,

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.610
is defined as the ratio
of this angle, the angle

01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:20.350
that the microscope produced
for the off-axis object,

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:28.820
for the same angle that the
eye would observe unaided,

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:32.210
in a very similar
case as the magnifier.

01:33:32.210 --> 01:33:36.450
So in order to compute this now,
it's not very difficult to do.

01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:37.980
We need two elements.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.250
One is the lateral
magnification of the objective.

01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:43.850
Because recall, the objective
actually forms a real image.

01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:45.860
So we have one.

01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.240
Here is the object.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.950
And here is its image.

01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.600
So we need, first
of all, to find out

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.710
where the intermediate
image appears with respect

01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:55.880
to the optical axis.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.920
That's the lateral
magnification of the objective.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:02.630
That is whatever.

01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:06.660
Well, I will say in the
second why this 160 appears.

01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:12.260
But the second
element that we need

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.380
is the angular magnification
of the eyepiece.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:20.180
Because this will allow us to
say how this distance over here

01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:26.150
translates into angle that
goes into the eye finally.

01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:30.330
So this one is actually
a familiar formula.

01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:33.300
This is the same formula
you had for the magnifier.

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.570
So go back one.

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:39.460
We said that-- actually,
it is over here already.

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.940
We said that the
magnifying power

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:45.950
of an eyepiece or a magnifier
equals the near distance

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:51.950
for the eye, which is about 25
centimeters, times the power

01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:54.690
of the lens, of the
positive lens that they use.

01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:56.140
So this is the same formula.

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.880
In microscopes, they don't
use exactly 25 centimeters.

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.120
They use 25.4 centimeters.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.318
So this is the standard.

01:35:03.318 --> 01:35:04.610
And how much is that in inches?

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:05.660
Is it 10 inches?

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.090
No.

01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.220
11, 12 inches.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.510
10 inches.

01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.070
I thought it would be
22-- oh, that's pounds.

01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.570
I'm sorry.

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:16.440
That's pounds.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.400
There's 10 inches then.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.350
So this is, then,
the same formula

01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:23.700
that we had for the magnifier.

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.420
Where did this come from?

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.600
Well, if you remember
one of the ways

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.010
to add the lateral
magnification is like this--

01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:42.340
1 minus si over F. So you
can write this as 1 minus si

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:50.320
over F equals F minus si
over F. And now I have to--

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.230
Ah, that worked.

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.210
So minus si--

01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:01.600
I am sorry.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:10.650
It is F minus si
over F. So F minus si

01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:23.066
is actually the distance between
the objective lens and the--

01:36:25.732 --> 01:36:27.860
it's basically this
distance L. That's

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.050
what I'm trying to get to.

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:31.700
So this is known as the tube
length of the microscope.

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:36.290
It is the distance between the
objective lens and the location

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.977
where you put the eyepiece.

01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:40.810
Of course, the eyepiece
is this whole thing.

01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:42.580
So that's where you
stick the eyepiece.

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:43.460
So this is standard.

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.370
In microscopes, it
is 160 millimeters

01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:48.100
and is known as the tube length.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.990
And this is what appears
in this formula over here.

01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:55.800
So basically, you can see that
if you pick the focal length

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.050
to be sufficiently
small, then you

01:36:58.050 --> 01:37:01.590
can get very high magnification
in the order of hundreds, maybe

01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:06.640
even 1,000.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.720
Let me ask two questions now.

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:15.710
First of all, what I just said.

01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:19.370
What do you think might stop
me from getting a focal length

01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:23.050
that is, let's say, 1 micron?

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.650
I pick a focal length to be
1 micron, and then I have--

01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:27.350
these are all in millimeters.

01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:30.380
So 160 millimeters over 1
micron, that would be what?

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:33.980
That would be about 160,000.

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:36.920
And then another micron here,
I would get a magnification

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.720
in the order of 1 billion.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:39.970
What stops me from doing that?

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.570
First of all, just
to get back to,

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:46.910
what is it from your experience?

01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:50.825
What is a typical magnification
that you get in microscopes?

01:37:50.825 --> 01:37:53.880
How about 1,000
orders of magnitude?

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.060
But if you apply
this formula here,

01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.860
you could easily get a
magnification of 1 billion

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.760
by picking the focal
length to be 1 micron.

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.132
What is wrong with my statement?

01:38:04.132 --> 01:38:05.090
Clearly, there's wrong.

01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:07.605
Otherwise, people
would be doing it.

01:38:07.605 --> 01:38:09.740
AUDIENCE: Is it
because you can't see

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.800
past the wave length of light?

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.307
That 1 micron is
the most you could

01:38:13.307 --> 01:38:14.390
focus because that's the--

01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.170
PROFESSOR: That is in the
correct direction, yes.

01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:30.380
The other possible
reason is the failure

01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.320
of the paraxial approximation.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.810
But the paraxial approximation
may fail all at once.

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:40.630
But I can always do something
more sophisticated to do

01:38:40.630 --> 01:38:42.848
non-paraxial calculations.

01:38:42.848 --> 01:38:45.390
Maybe you're saying that if the
paraxial approximation fails,

01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:47.750
then this formula fails as well.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:50.400
So then you don't get
as good magnification.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.740
I think you guys both
captured-- the two of you

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.790
captured the answer in its
entirety You have another one?

01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:59.080
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if it's another.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.960
To make such a high--

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.870
such a short focal
length lens we'll

01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:07.170
have to make a very big lens.

01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:08.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:39:08.690 --> 01:39:10.300
So you have to be
very highly curved.

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.640
Remember the focal
length of the lens

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:18.820
is proportional to the
radius of curvature.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:21.030
So you would have to
make a lens with a radius

01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:23.460
of curvature equal to 1 micron.

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:26.140
And that's when you get
into problems like the--

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.510
what's your name again?

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:31.825
[INAUDIBLE] answered
the question before.

01:39:31.825 --> 01:39:32.980
AUDIENCE: Dean.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:33.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.730
This is what Dean answered.

01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:43.360
If you try to make a curvature
that is as sharp as 1 micron,

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.960
then basically you
get into the range

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.413
of very strong
diffraction of light.

01:39:49.413 --> 01:39:50.830
So basically all
these geometrical

01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:52.390
optics that we do
here, they fail.

01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:55.870
In fact, you discover if you did
make such a very small element

01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:58.630
that the light does
not really focus.

01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.740
We'll see what it does.

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.850
But it does not propagate.

01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:07.510
So reasonable focal lengths are
in the range of 1 centimeter,

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:08.410
a few millimeters.

01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:11.660
These are typical microscope
objective focal length.

01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.910
And the eyepieces are similar.

01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:14.660
And that's why you
get magnification

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:19.047
on the order of 1,000.

01:40:19.047 --> 01:40:20.380
The next topic is the telescope.

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.220
But I think I've
exhausted your endurance.

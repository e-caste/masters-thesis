DENNIS FREEMAN:
So today the idea

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.880
is to think about CT systems
in exactly the same way

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.852
that we thought about
DT systems last time.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:33.310
For the past couple
of weeks, we've

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.320
been looking at many
representations of both CT

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.360
and DT systems.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.250
Last lecture we made a picture
of a bunch of different ways

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.960
to think about DT
systems and we tried

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.610
to think about
relations between them.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.690
The new thing from
last time was this idea

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.200
of a z transform, which formally
is the link between a system

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.380
function, a function
of z, and a unit sample

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.849
response, a function of n.

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.640
We showed last time
that because we already

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.800
understand a whole lot of
these other connections

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.292
that connection is
very straightforward.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.000
What we're going to
do today is precisely

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.150
the same thing for CT.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.559
The boxes barely changed.

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.350
You should see the
relationship immediately

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.600
between the former set of
boxes and this set of boxes.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.750
And we'll do a
very similar thing.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.790
We'll look at a relationship
between the system

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.280
function, which is
a function of s,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.820
and the impulse response,
which is a function of t.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.980
We'll look at that
similar function for CT,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.100
the thing that's analogous
to the z transform in DT.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.790
So Laplace transform,
just like in DT

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.360
where it maps a function
of time to a function of z,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.790
here it maps a function
of time, which in CT we'll

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.840
write that way.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.100
It maps that to a function of s.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.564
So s is going to be
something like x of t

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:04.500
e to the minus st dt.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
So the idea is going to be that
this was a function of time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.465
This is only a function of s.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.090
We get the function
of s by integrating

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.610
some function of time,
but we integrate time out

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.390
so time disappears.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.820
So the idea then
is that we end up

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.940
with a map linking a function
of time to a function of s.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.080
Presumably you've
seen this before.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.860
This is a topic in 1803.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.060
Smile.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.900
Nod your head.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.090
Make me feel like I'm
connecting to you, right.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.960
Right, so you've all
seen this before.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.180
Nothing's new.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.640
Actually there is one
tiny thing that's new.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.770
In 1803 they use a
variant of the Laplace

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.800
transform that we will
call the unilateral Laplace

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.485
transform, which means they
started their integrals at 0.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.930
For reasons that will be clear
at the very end of the course,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.200
when we do Fourier
transforms to make

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.840
the transition between this kind
of a transform and a Fourier

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
transform easier we
will do something

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.930
called a bilateral transform.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.540
The only difference being that
we will start our integrals

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.040
at minus infinity.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.650
There are subtle differences
between those two transforms.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.360
Rest assured, that the
big picture is identical.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.880
And when there is an
important difference

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.740
we will point that out.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.030
So for the rest of today and
for the rest of two weeks

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.910
I will only talk about
bilateral transforms, the kind

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.710
that we integrate
over all of time.

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:36.310
And the easiest way
I know to get started

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.050
is to just try some, right.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.570
You could study
properties of the math.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.750
That's probably the way
it was studied in 1803.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.700
I find it easier to develop some
intuition for what's going on

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.760
here by just doing some.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.500
So here's probably
the simplest Laplace

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.140
transform we'll look at.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.220
What's the Laplace transform
of a function of time

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.370
that exponentially decays
with positive time in a 0

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.000
for time less than 0?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
As you might expect, the
first transform we'll do

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.420
involve simply plugging
that mathematical formula

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.890
into the definition.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.240
So the x of s, the
Laplace transform,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.910
is always the function of
time integrated against e

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.370
to the minus st.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.680
We're only doing
bilateral but notice

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.460
that the 0 for t less than
0 cuts off the bottom.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.230
So in fact, you would
get the same answer

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.760
if you did bilateral
or unilateral.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.170
And then we're left with
running this integral

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.950
over infinite time this kind
of a function, which comes out

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.880
looking like this.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.650
The only tricky thing is
thinking about the implications

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.080
of that infinity thing.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.550
There's going to be certain
values of s for which

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.180
that integral diverges.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.140
So to think about that,
think about the thing

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.480
that we're integrating.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.480
We're integrating something
that looks like e to the pt.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.620
We're integrating
against some function.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.240
So define the original function
of time is e to the minus t,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.990
here we have e to the
minus st. Let's just

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.970
focus on that one for a
moment, the e to the st thing.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.280
We're going to generally be
worried about values of s,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.550
or here, values of p,
that have complex values.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.800
We're going to be looking
at the s plane just the same

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.665
as last time we
looked at the z plane.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.790
So we're going to think
about this thing might have

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.155
a real and imaginary component.

00:05:36.155 --> 00:05:38.155
So we might have something
like looks like this.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.280
Sigma would be the
real part of p.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.790
Omega would be the
imaginary part of p.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.420
And somebody want
to hazard a guess

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.720
at what that might look
like if I tried to expand it

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.880
as a real and imaginary part?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.360
Someone wanted to hazard
a guess at the name

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.920
of the equation I might use?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.760
AUDIENCE: Euler.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.700
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Euler's equation, sure.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.500
So I would expand this
by Euler's equation

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.840
and I get something of
the form e to the sigma t,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.460
cos omega t plus j sine omega t.

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.880
The point of writing
that out is that I

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.220
hope it's clear that
convergence of the integral

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.765
is going to depend critically on
the real or the imaginary part?

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:32.890
Real, right?

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.169
So the convergence is going
to be determined by this.

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.210
This is the thing that's
affecting the magnitude.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.251
That's the thing that's
getting smaller or bigger

00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:42.980
as I go to infinity
or minus infinity.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.330
The cosine term, the sine
term, those are oscillating.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.460
They don't make the function
be more or less convergent

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.867
than it was or originally.

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:57.450
So when I'm thinking
about convergence

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.240
I'm going to be thinking
about the real part.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.320
So over here if I want to
make this integral converge

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.305
I want to be thinking about
t going from 0 to infinity.

00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:08.730
Well, 0 is not a problem.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.530
e to the 0 is 1,
that's going to work.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.420
It's the infinity
part that's a problem.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.160
So if I have infinity
plugged in for t,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.060
what's the range of values for
s for plus 1 that makes sense?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.300
That's the important
question, right.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.010
So I'm going to
want to constrain

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.770
the real part of that number,
s plus 1, to be bigger than 0.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.320
If the real part of that
number is bigger than 0,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.300
then this thing
will converge to 0.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.180
If that converges to 0 then
I have a simple answer,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.940
it's just the answer
in the bottom.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.190
It's in the bottom so I have
to put a minus sign, that

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.340
kills that minus sign.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.000
So my answer is 1 over s plus 1.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.230
Easy, right?

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.680
And we will say that the Laplace
transform has a functional

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.322
form, 1 over s plus 1.

00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:58.280
And it has region of
convergence, the real part

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.485
of s bigger then minus 1.

00:07:59.485 --> 00:08:02.030
Just solving that inequality
for the real part of s so

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.190
I can draw it on an s plane.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.590
So we'll associate
then with this

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.480
s transform a picture which we
will commonly call the pole 0

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.630
pattern.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.350
Is just a picture
of the s plane which

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.890
shows me the singularities, the
poles and zeroes of the Laplace

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.469
transform and the
region of convergence.

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:24.510
So there's a single pole.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.110
There's a pole at
s equals a minus 1,

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.940
so I indicate that by the x.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.880
And I have region of convergence
which I'll illustrate here

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.650
with the gray area.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.480
So it converges for all values
of s that are in the gray area.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.010
OK, easy right?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.140
Trivial.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.400
OK, so now you get to
talk to your neighbor.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.700
OK, turn to your neighbor.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.110

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.620
Wonderful.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.000
The universal answer-- I think
it was universal-- was 1.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.210
So how do you get 1?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.057
What do I do?

DENNIS FREEMAN: Precisely.

So what I do is just stick it
in the formula, do it twice.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.030
Laplace transform, like
the z transform, is linear.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.400
It will turn out that
the Laplace of a sum

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.585
is the sum of the Laplaces.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:44.142
If I simply stick the expression
for x2 into the definition,

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:45.725
you can see it splits
into two pieces.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.090
And I get two parts.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.520
1 over s plus 1
just like I got--

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.820
so the first part looks just
like x1, the first example.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.340
The second one looks
almost the same

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.980
except there's a 2 where
there used to be 1.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.050
Shockingly, it changes
one of the ones into a 2.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.570
And then the only issue is where
is the region of convergence.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.160
So this part converges
if the real part of s

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.758
is bigger than minus 1.

00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:21.030
This converges if the real part
of s is bigger than minus 2.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.950
So they both converge
if the real part of s

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.740
is bigger than minus?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.000
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.110
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1, right.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.680
If I'm in the region of s
where both the first part

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.449
and the second part
converges then I'm fine.

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:38.990
So that was all very
straightforward.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:44.020
I get an answer that
was number one, OK.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.050
So the transform is just
the sum of those two pieces.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.750
And the region is the
region of overlap.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.980
A more interesting
case, and where

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.390
things are a little
bit different when

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.306
we think about the
bilateral Laplace transform

00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:01.890
than unilateral,
is that the regions

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.850
can be more complicated.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.020
So here's an example where
I've got a backwards traveling

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.710
function.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.980
So now the function only
exists for t less than 0.

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:22.100
As you might expect, just
stick it in the formula

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.240
and see what happens.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.800
So stick this
expression into here.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.580
Now it lips off the
top of the integral.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.330
But when you're grinding
through integrals

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.880
it's hard to tell
the difference.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.090
You get something that
looks very much the same.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.730
The thing that is different,
notice that the function

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.960
was upside down.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.720
It was minus something
rather than plus something

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.600
like the first example was.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.110
So the first example was e to
the minus t, t bigger than 0.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.470
This example is minus e to
the minus t, t less than 0.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:05.700
That gave me a minus sign
here but the nontrivial limit

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.001
is at the top rather
than at the bottom.

00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:09.750
That's the reason I
put the minus sign in.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.333
So it would kill the
other minus sign.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:20.530
Also, since I need convergence
at t equals minus infinity,

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.870
the region flips.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.830
I still need to have
that sort of thing decay

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.920
so that the integral exists.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.620
But now the functions
are flipped in time.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:40.920
So the important range
of s is now flipped.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.980
So now I get the same functional
form exactly, but a region

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.119
that's on the other side.

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:51.660
That's one of the
central differences

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.560
between the bilateral and
the unilateral transform.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.540
I need to tell you the
region of convergence

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.572
for you to know which
of those two functions

00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:03.530
that I'm talking about.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.260
OK, so the important
thing from this example

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.920
is the functional form
looks exactly the same.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.290
I had a functional form
in time, e to the minus t,

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.390
e to the minus t.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.000
It was that functional
form of time

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.132
that I crank through
the integration for,

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.590
and it's not
surprising then that I

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.762
get a functional form for the s
transform that looks the same.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.720
If you start with functional
forms in time that

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.875
look the same, you get
functional forms in s

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:37.160
that look the same.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.420
However, since the
region of t was

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.990
different for the two functions
the region of s is different.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.400
There's also the negative sign.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.190
There's the fact that
this flipped this way,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.220
and that's related to the fact
that my region of integration

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.060
extends from minus infinity
to 0 versus 0 to infinity.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.160
The important limit flipped
from being the bottom limit

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.020
to the top limit.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.380
OK, that's roughly it.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.960
So just to make sure that
everybody is with me,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.112
what's the Laplace
transform of this symmetric

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:15.820
looking function?

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.147
So which of those functions
is the Laplace transform

00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:54.230
of the symmetric function?

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.750
It's about 3 calories to
raise your hand, right?

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.420
Good exercise,
makes you breathe.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.130
The answer is?

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.110
Oh, come on.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.960
OK, it's more like 90% correct.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.540
So not everybody has it right.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.330
What am I going to do?

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
It's just like the
last one, right?

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.640
Just stick it in.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.810
If you think about writing
the integral of this

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.560
the complicated part is this
absolute value sine thing.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.050
So split it into two parts,
that way the absolute value

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.790
is one thing when
t is bigger than 0

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.831
and it's a different thing
when t is less than 0.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.910
Now looks like just the
sum of two functions that

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.080
are both trivial.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.689
One is right sided, the
other is left sided,

00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:51.730
so we might be expecting
something a little funky

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.790
compared to the last one.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.640
So this guy that is
left sided in time

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.420
ends up with a
left-sided transform,

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.040
just like the previous examples.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.390
So we see that this
part, which looks

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:17.680
like a pole at 1, so
we're going to get

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.940
a part of the transform
that has a pole at 1.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.360
And it's going to be valid
for regions in s space

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.450
for s magnitude less than 1, OK.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:33.510
Then we're going to get
this other piece, that

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.215
corresponds to a pole minus 1.

00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:40.260
And it's right sided, so
like the right sided examples

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.060
that we saw before
there's a right sided

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.500
region of convergence here.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.240
So it's going to be right of its
pole, but it's pole is minus 1.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.100
So in sum, the
region is going to be

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.450
to the right of the
pole at minus 1,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.270
and to the left of the
pole at 1 because we

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.650
have to be in the
part of s space

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.520
where both of those two
integrals converged.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.870
So we end up with the ROC
being the intersection, OK.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.540
So we get a pole 0 pattern
that looks like this.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.580
There are two poles now.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.329
When you add
together a part that

00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:18.120
looks like a pole a
minus 1 and a part that

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.285
looks like a pole at
1, you get two poles.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.600
And the region becomes
the band in between.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.570
Again, because the
regions of s transforms

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.640
because of Euler's
expression is determined

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.750
by the real part of s.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.926
So that we're always going to
get some kind of vertical band.

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:42.050
The band is always going
to be delimited by a pole,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.810
just like it was
in a z transform.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.740
There's two poles.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.240
So all we really
need to worry about

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.330
is which region
bounded by two poles

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.110
we're going to correspond to.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:59.244
OK, so the answer was two.

00:20:59.244 --> 00:21:00.910
Written in a little
bit of a funky form,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.160
but if factor this you can
see that there's two poles,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.881
one at 1, and one at minus 1.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.930
So hopefully that's all
trivial, that's all stuff

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.655
you can do in your sleep.

00:21:14.655 --> 00:21:16.280
What I want to do is
think a little bit

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.050
about what the implications are.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.520
What are we doing?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.440
What is a region of convergence?

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.330
So I want to think now about
four different functions,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.100
in four different
poles zero patterns,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.721
in four different regions.

00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:34.720
And I want to think about
the defining integral,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.430
that one up there.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:42.530
I want to think about x of s is
the integral over all of time

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.210
of x of te to the minus st dt.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.959
What are we doing when we
take a Laplace transform?

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.500
And what are we
doing when we specify

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.260
a region of convergence?

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.030
Because I can help
you think about

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.280
what should the answer
be, which is helpful

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.690
when you're trying
to think about

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.160
does my answer make any sense?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.520
Or what am I doing anyway?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.870
So x1, this was
e to the minus t.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.292
So it had a pole at minus 1
in the region to the right.

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:12.000
Right-sided function,
right-sided region.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.370
Here we have a more
complicated function,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.600
which can be the sum
of two poles, one

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.962
at minus 1 and 1 at minus 2.

00:22:23.962 --> 00:22:25.670
And we got a region
that was to the right

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.770
of the rightmost pole.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.540
Right-sided function,
right-sided region.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.080
Here was x3, which was the
negative part of that one.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.340
We got the same pole minus
1 one the left-sided region.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.619
And here was the symmetric
one where we found

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:43.910
that the region was in between.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.950
So what I want to
think now is what

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.400
happens when we have a
particular value of s that

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.110
is inside or outside
those regions.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.439
What's really going on?

00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:54.980
So let's start by
thinking about what

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.455
would happen if I considered
an s depicted by this red x.

00:22:59.455 --> 00:23:00.830
I probably shouldn't
have used x.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.900
I should have
probably used a star.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.550
That's not a pole.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:09.050
That's the value of
s in this integral.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.970
What happens if I choose to
integrate against the function

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.705
e to the minus st where s is 0?

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:21.230
If I choose to integrate
against that function,

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.120
that function as
depicted by red here.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.660
So the convergence
of the integral,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.740
the convergence of
the thing that I'm

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.690
calling a Laplace
transform depends entirely

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.500
on the convergence of x.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.030
That's what s equals 0 means.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.820
s equals 0 says, the
converge of the transform

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.810
depends entirely on the
convergence of the function.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.900
So that means that this
function converges,

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.070
it's in the region
of convergence.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.310
This one converges, it's in
the region of convergence.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.750
This one does not converge,
this one diverges.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.890
As you go to minus infinity
the function is unbounded.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.320
The transform doesn't exist.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.261
s equals 0 is not in the region.

00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:10.135
That's what it means.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.680
Here, if I integrate against e
to the 0 both sides converge,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.640
there is no problem.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.440
I'm in the region.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.960
So now if I think about a
different s, what if I move

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.220
s a little bit to the left?

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.315
Say, minus 1/2.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.000
If I'm thinking about
integrating against e

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.410
to the minus st, and
if s is minus 1/2,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:44.120
that's e to the 1/2 t.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.020
e to the 1/2 t is a
function that for all time

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.730
becomes greater as I go
toward positive infinity,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.850
exponentially greater.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.080
So if I think about what happens
if I multiplied this x of t

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.500
by that weighting
function, does the product

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.460
converge or diverge?

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.860
It converges because the
convergence of the blue line

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.250
is faster than the
divergence of the red line.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.400
Even though the red
line is diverging,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.460
the product is
overall convergent.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.570
OK that's because of
the relative positions

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.470
of the red x and the blue x.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.860
The blue function is converging
faster than the red function is

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.640
diverging.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.010
The product converges.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.050
So this x is in the
region of convergence.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.670
That's what it means.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.880
Similarly here,
this is diverging.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.379
The red curve is
still diverging.

00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:45.420
It's the same red curves
are all these red curves

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.700
are diverging to the right.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.960
This one is converging.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.200
It's ultimately converging
as the sum of two things, e

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.740
to the minus t and e to
the minus 2t, both of which

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.670
are fast compared to the
explosion e to the 1/2 t.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.880
So I'm in the region.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.286
Here it's exploding
in a region of time

00:26:08.286 --> 00:26:09.285
that I don't care about.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.320
And it's convergent
for this region of time

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.005
that I do care about, but
it's not convergent enough.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.720
So the integral still diverges,
I'm not in the region.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.540
And finally, this one
is more complicated.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.950
The integrand, this thing
that I'm integrating against,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:38.380
it's always becoming greater as
I go toward positive infinity.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.460
That tends to be
convergent on this side

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.410
and divergent on that
side, but it's not

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:49.390
divergent enough to make
the function not converge.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.430
So I'm in the region.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.220
If I make an even bigger pole.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:03.890
So say I put e to the st, if
I put that at minus 1 1/2,

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.000
then that is fast enough
that it breaks the product.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.520
The product is no
longer integrable.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.990
So this divergent trend is
enough to make that diverge.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.080
I'm not in the region anymore.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.080
Similarly here, I'm
not in the region

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.775
because I've made it fast enough
that one of the parts diverges.

00:27:29.991 --> 00:27:31.490
One of the parts
coverages, but they

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:37.190
have to both converge in order
for the interval to converge.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.070
Here, I have finally
made the left-hand side

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.750
convergent enough to make
the product converge.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.880
So that's fine.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.030
And here, this is
accelerating so fast

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.820
that although it
was stabilizing here

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:57.050
it became non-convergent
over here.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.090
What I want you to get
from this is the idea

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.770
that you can think
physically about what

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.230
the region of convergence is.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.670
The region of
convergence is a function

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:10.010
that I stick into the integral
to make the integral converge.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.810
So the region of
convergence corresponds

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.770
to those exponents that
makes sense for which

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.990
the integral will converge.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.465
OK, with that vast new insight
this problem is now trivial.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:31.950
Enumerate all possible
functions x of t

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.648
for which that's the transform.

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:13.410
So how many functions are there?

00:30:19.492 --> 00:30:20.450
Keep going, keep going.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:24.140
I'm still looking
for a right answer.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.587
That's a clue.

00:30:25.587 --> 00:30:27.170
Right, I don't see
a right answer yet.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:27.990
So keep going.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.790
Keep going.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.030
Actually, I do now.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.470
I see two right answers.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.000
Can we make it three?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.650
Going once.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.390
Going twice.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.150
Two right answers?

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.650
OK, the right answer is three.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.480
So now that I've told
you the right answer,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.900
you rationalize for me why
is the right answer three?

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.230
Talk to your neighbor.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.968
Why is the right answer three?

00:30:56.968 --> 00:31:00.447
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.060
OK, who can volunteer
a concise statement

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.520
for why the right answer
is three and not four?

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.524
Yes?

00:32:14.524 --> 00:32:17.863
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.460
That's exactly right.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.920
There are two
poles, and there are

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.920
three ways you can divide
up the s plane by two poles.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.390
So there's four functions
here, let's think about four s

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:33.890
planes.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.940
So each of these functions--
so here's a pole at minus 2.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.740
Here's a pole at 2.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.630
Minus 2, 2, minus
2, 2, minus 2, 2.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.175
They all have the same poles.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.700
OK, where's the region that
corresponds to function one?

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.280
So here's pole at
minus 2. e to the minus

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.510
2t corresponds to
a pole at minus 2.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.490
u of t is right-sided function.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.110
Where's the region
that corresponds

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.450
to the pole minus 2?

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.980
To the right of minus 2.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:27.140
So this first function converges
to the right of minus 2.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:36.970
This function is a pole at 2, e
to the 2t and it's right sided.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:41.700
So it's right sided with
regard to a pole at 2.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.380
So what's the region
that corresponds

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.140
to a right-sided
time function that

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.060
corresponds to a pole
at 2, or that's right

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.365
sided with regard to here.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.540
So the net region of
convergence is that region.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.710
Make sense?

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.520
So then I have a pole at
minus 2 with the right sided.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.620
OK, so that's this.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:13.650
And a pole as 2,
which is left sided.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.820
So that's this.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.250
So that corresponds
to a region here.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:27.980
Then the third one I have a
pole at minus 2, which is left

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.350
sided.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.905
So that means I want to
have convergence here.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.480
And I have a pole at 2
which is right sided,

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.280
and I need convergence here.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.610
There's no way to
make that convergent.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.010
If I choose my s to make the
first part convergent then

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.330
my second part is not
convergent, and vice versa.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.330
So there's no way
to do that one.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.130
So this is no.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.820
This is yes.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.460
This is yes.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.825
And then finally, this is a
pole at minus 2 to the left.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.920
And a pole at 2 to the left.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.590
So that's that one.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.970
So that's OK.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.890
So the idea is that there's
only three ways to chop up

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.000
a space delimited by two poles.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.372
OK, so it looks like
you to have four

00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:23.830
because we're used to thinking
about the two by two matrix.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.996
That's not the way it works.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.880
OK, two last things.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.230
First last thing.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.850
Probably the most
important thing

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.250
about the Laplace transform,
probably the only reason

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.190
we bother with that whatever
is that you can use it to solve

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.810
differential equations.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.420
That's probably the
most important reason

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.010
for even talking about it.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.600
The fact that we can take
it is of zero consequence.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.052
We can take lots of integrals.

00:35:52.052 --> 00:35:53.760
The interesting thing
about this integral

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.360
is that it helps us to solve
differential equations.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.020
And the trick is that if we
start with the differential

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.504
equation we can take
the Laplace transform

00:36:03.504 --> 00:36:04.920
of the whole
differential equation

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.260
and that will end
up making sense.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.050
Just like the z transform, the
Laplace transform is linear.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.710
The Laplace
transform of a sum is

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.020
sum of the Laplace transforms.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.660
That's pretty simple just
by looking at the definition

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.380
because we can distribute the
e to the minus st over a sum,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.280
if x were a sum it distributes.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.790
So that's easy.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.750
The other important
thing is the derivative.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.210
What's the Laplace
transform of a derivative?

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.250
That turns out to be easy.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.160
If that weren't easy, we
wouldn't even bother with it.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.390
But it is easy.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.020
You can see that if we
make the assumption that x

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.190
is the Laplace transform
of x, and then if we define

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.170
y is the derivative
of x, we can ask

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.944
what's the Laplace
transform of y

00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:53.610
and that will tell
us what's the Laplace

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.420
transform of the derivative.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.950
Take the definition
of transform,

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:04.910
stick in y equals x dot
and integrate by parts.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.400
You all can integrate
by parts much better

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.650
than I can because I
took it 35 years ago.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:18.195
But it's very easy to see that
if we call this u and this v

00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:23.240
dot, integral u dv is uv
minus the integral v du.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.030
The trick is that taking
integrals and derivatives

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:34.180
of this part is easy,
it's an exponential.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.150
Exponentials are
the one function

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.510
whose derivative has the
same shape as the function.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.800
That's the reason it's easy.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:50.300
So that means that I can
easily integrate that part.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.960
I can easily
differentiate that part

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.626
to get something that looks just
like this, except as multiplied

00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:55.370
by minus s.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.810
And that minus s
is the only thing

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.570
that ends up being important.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.450
The Laplace transform
of the derivative

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:10.980
is s times the Laplace transform
of the original function.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.090
OK, differentiating
time is the same

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:18.350
as multiplying by s in
a Laplace transform.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.900
Because of that it's
trivial to think

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:26.050
about the Laplace transform
of a differential equation.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.720
Linearity says you
can do it term wise.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.610
And a differential
equation is something

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.500
that has a bunch of
derivatives in it.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.170
Those all turn
into multiply by s.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.990
So you end up then with
this differential equation

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.175
being replaced by this.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.810
So the Laplace transform of
the derivative is s times y.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.240
The Laplace transform of y is y.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.530
Now I have to figure out the
Laplace transform of delta.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.037
OK, turns out that's easy.

00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:00.620
What's the Laplace
transform of delta?

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.630
That's why we like
delta functions.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.580
Delta functions seem
mathematically bizarre

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.530
but they're so
easy to work with,

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.990
that's the only
reason we use them.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.180
If you think about the
Laplace transform of delta

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.760
just stick it in the formula.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.830
The interesting thing
about the delta function

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:20.950
is that it's 0
almost everywhere.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.040
So we don't need to
worry about the product

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.080
except where the delta
function is not 0.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.740
Because the delta function
makes the time axis mostly 0.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.540
The only place
that's not 0 is 0.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.690
So the only value of this
function that matters

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:44.437
in the least is its value at 0.

00:39:44.437 --> 00:39:46.770
If you think about what that
looks like is as a picture.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.730
So if we have something that
looks like e to the minus st

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.480
and if we multiply
by an impulse.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.260
The impulse is 0 except at 0.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.260
The only thing that
survives that multiplication

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:08.360
is the value of e to the
minus st at t equals 0.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.280
We can think about
that as a limit.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.290
We thought about
the delta function

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:16.010
as a limit of a function that
looks like this, minus epsilon,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.770
epsilon t, 1 over 2 epsilon.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.820
So that the limit as epsilon
goes to 0 becomes a delta.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.060
That's how we defined
the impulse function.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.430
If we think about that
definition in terms

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.300
of this product you
can see that you

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.270
get exactly this expression.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.510
So if you multiply this
times this all you pick out

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.330
is this part.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.410
As you make epsilon smaller,
and smaller, and smaller,

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:52.262
you focus just on
that point right at 0.

00:40:52.262 --> 00:40:53.470
The area of the impulse is 1.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:58.880
Therefore, the integral of
this thing is everywhere 1.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.530
So this sifts out.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:01.710
That's what we'll call it.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.335
So this is called
the sifting property.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.370
It's the nice part about
the delta function.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.500
If you integrate a
function with regard

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.110
to time where the function
is multiplied by delta,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.600
that integral is the value
of the function at 0.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.840
It sifts out the 0 value.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.260
That means that the Laplace
transform of the delta function

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.370
is 1.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.830
It's the most simple
function you can imagine.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.330
So the net effect of that
is that this differential

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.690
equation, the Laplace transform
of the differential equation

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.565
becomes an algebraic equation.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.050
That means that we can
solve it by doing algebra.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.500
So in particular, we can
readily solve the equation

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.830
to find an expression for y.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.530
We saw that previously.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.720
We recognize ys.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.580
It's a recognition thing.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.950
It's a table look
up sort of thing.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:09.110
We know the form
1 over s plus 1.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.150
So we know the time
function that is the answer.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.440
So notice that when
we do this just

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.390
the way that happened
with the z transform.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.950
When we solve a
differential equation

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.190
by using Laplace transform we
basically don't use calculus.

00:42:24.662 --> 00:42:26.870
We use the Laplace transform
to turn the differential

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.620
equation which is calculus in
1803 and that kind of stuff,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.200
into algebra, which
is high school.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.060
We do everything with algebra.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:39.014
The only annoying thing is
this table look up thing.

00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:40.430
It's a little
annoying that we had

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:46.975
to do the inverse Laplace
transform by table look up.

00:42:46.975 --> 00:42:50.410
It's a little dissatisfying.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.630
So I'll just mention that
there is a formal way of not

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.220
doing table look up.

00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:01.030
For the kinds of
problems we will

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.910
look at using this
formula is so much more

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:07.880
difficult than table look
up that we will never

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.240
use that formula.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.160
It will be useful
for proving things,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.496
it will not be useful
for inverting things.

00:43:16.496 --> 00:43:17.870
Because of the
form of the things

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.640
we do, linear
differential equations

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.010
with constant coefficients,
it will always

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.960
be easier to do
table look up then

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.970
it will be to run this integral.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.247
If you're interested in that
integral, fine, take 1804.

00:43:29.247 --> 00:43:30.830
There's a bunch of
people who know all

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.000
about how that integral works.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.320
It's spectacularly interesting
but we won't use it here.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.020
So the upshot then is that
the Laplace transform,

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.840
we learn about it
because it's very useful

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.110
and its utility comes from
a bunch of properties.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.600
The ones we illustrated
today, we use the fact

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.990
that it was linear
and we use the fact

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.550
that there's a
simple relationship

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.590
with differentiation.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.470
Using just those facts
it turns out easy

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.550
to do differential equations
using the Laplace transform.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.290
And there's many
other things I've

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:12.850
illustrated in the
last two slides

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.360
but I won't go over
them right now.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.860
The idea of taking limits
using Laplace transforms.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.990
It turns out that the
Laplace transform is what

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.880
we call a reciprocal function.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.695
Since the integrand depends
and the product of s and t,

00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:33.950
s gets large, corresponds
to t gets small.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.570
So you can take the
limit for things

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.900
with time getting small by
looking at s getting big.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.530
Similarly, you can
do the reverse.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.490
You can look at time gets big
by looking at s gets small.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.876
That's just properties
of the Laplace transform.

00:44:50.876 --> 00:44:52.000
And there's lots of others.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.670
Besides the table there's
lots of properties

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.920
we won't have time
to go over but I

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.060
will hint at some of them.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.880
And in particular, there's
a very useful transformation

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.990
where you take the Laplace
transform of a circuit.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.720
And that's in the homework.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.540
So that's extremely useful.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.099
The major point then
is just that there's

00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:12.890
lots of relationships,
there's lots of ways

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.370
we think about CT systems.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.480
This Laplace
transform is a new one

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:22.360
and it's very useful because of
the properties in that table.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.470
OK, thanks a lot.

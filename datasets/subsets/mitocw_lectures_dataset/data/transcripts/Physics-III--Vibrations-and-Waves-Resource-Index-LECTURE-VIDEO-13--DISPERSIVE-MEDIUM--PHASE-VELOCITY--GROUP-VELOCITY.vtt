00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.930
YEN-JIE LEE: Hello, everybody.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.610
Welcome back to 8.03.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.070
Today we are going to continue
the discussion of waves.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.380
We will discuss a very
interesting phenomenon

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.130
not today, which is dispersion.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.720
And before that, we
will discuss a bit,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.530
just to give you some
reminder, about what we

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.950
have learned so far.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.690
So we discovered
this wave equation,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.280
which is showing
here, in the class,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.200
and then we also show
you that it described

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.850
three different kinds
of systems, which

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.120
we included in the lecture--

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.380
the massive strings,
which are the strings

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.680
can actually oscillate up
and down in a wide direction.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.030
And also we discussed
about sound waves.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.450
This is also discussed
in a previous lecture.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.440
And sound waves can be
described by wave equation.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.490
And finally, the last
time we discussed

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.110
electromagnetic waves.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.870
It's a special kind
of wave involving

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.060
two oscillating fields.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.580
One is actually
the electric field,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.670
the other one is magnetic field.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.304
So that's kind of interesting,
because this is actually

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.720
slightly different
from what we've

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.020
discussed before in
the previous two cases.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.010
This is actually a
three dimensional wave,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.290
and also involving two
different components.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.740
And we also discussed
the solution,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.220
the traveling wave solution
of the electromagnetic waves.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.940
As you can see from
here, the electric field

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.970
is showing us the red,
and the magnetic field

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.470
is showing us the blue.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.910
And you can see that in
case of traveling wave,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.430
they are in phase.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.090
And the magnitude reach
maxima simultaneously

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.620
for electric field and
the magnetic field.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.680
And while in the case
of standing wave,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.150
there's a phase difference.
so they don't reach maxima

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.080
simultaneously in the standing
electromagnetic field case.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.170
OK, so what are we
going to discuss today?

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.270
We would like to discuss the
strategy to send information

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.670
using waves.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.780
How do we actually send
information using waves?

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.440
So you can say, OK,
maybe I can just

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.620
send a harmonic oscillation.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.870
So If I do this
harmonic oscillation,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.710
I can basically
produce harmonic waves.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.800
They are moving up and
down, and is actually

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.650
always constant angular
momentum and angular frequency.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.650
And maybe that's a way
to send the information.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.630
But this kind of wave is, in
reality, not super helpful,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.690
because if you fill the whole
space with harmonic waves, then

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.840
you don't know when did you
actually send the signal.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.790
Because it's always
oscillating up and down,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
so you don't know the
starting time of the signal.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.090
So in reality, these kind of
simple harmonic oscillating

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.010
traveling wave is
not super helpful.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.740
So what is actually helpful?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.000
That's the question.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720
So what is actually helpful
is to produce square pulse,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.800
for example.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.910
We can create square pulse,
for example, in this case,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.860
I can create a
square pulse here.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.800
And in the next time interval,
I don't create a square pulse.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.470
In the next time interval,
I don't do anything.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.040
And I create another square
pulse here, et cetera,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.980
et cetera, OK.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.310
If you use this kind of
strategy what we can do

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.170
is to have some kind of receiver
here to actually measure

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.170
the magnitude of the pulse.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.079
And then we can actually
interpret this data.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.920
So this wave is going to
where the positive x direction

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.070
or going to the right-hand
side of the board.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.360
And the receiver will be
able to interpret this data

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.050
by appraising this
ratio on the energy

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.210
or on the measure
of the amplitude.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.920
Then I can say, oh,
now I'd receive a 0,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.900
and then the next
signal I'm receiving

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.020
is 1, and this one is
0, and 0, and 1, and 0.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.830
In this way, I can
actually send information

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.550
and that this information can be
verified as a function of time.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.220
So in short, what
would be useful

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.750
is probably to use a
narrow square pulse,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.750
and that would be very helpful
in transmitting information.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.350
So if we consider an
ideal string case--

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:24.810
if I have an ideal string,
as we learned before,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.070
the behavior of the string is
described by the wave equation.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.620
Partial squared psi
partial t squared,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.210
and this is equal to v
squared partial squared

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.180
psi partial t squared.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.530
And this v is actually
related to the speed

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.990
of the progressing
wave, as we discussed

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.260
before-- the progressing
wave solution.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.940
And if I have this
idealized string,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.240
and it obey the wave equation,
the simple version of wave

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.100
equation, then I would be
able to divide the dispersion

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.790
relation.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.200
So I can now write down my
harmonic progressing wave

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.730
in the form of sine
kx minus omega t.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.080
If I have a harmonic
oscillating wave propagating

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.880
toward the positive x
direction at the speed of v.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.630
I can write it down in
this functional form, where

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.080
k, as a reminder,
is the wavenumber,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.260
and the omega is actually
the angular frequency.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.310
And therefore, if I plug in
this solution, and of course,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.890
it can have arbitrary amplitude.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.580
If I plug in this
solution to this equation,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.770
then what I'm going
to get is, as we

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.290
did in the last
few lectures, there

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.440
would be a fixed
relation between k,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.590
which is the wavenumber, and the
omega, the angular frequency.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.570
So the fixed relation
is actually omega over k

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.980
would be equal to
v, which is actually

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.610
the velocity in
this wave equation.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.540
And from the
previous discussion,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.490
we know this is actually
equal to a squared root of T

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.400
over rho L, where T is
actually the tension,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.410
the constant tension, which
we apply on this string,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.740
and the rho L is actually the
mass per unit as a reminder.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.550
So what does this mean?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.490
What does this equation mean?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.270
We call it dispersion
relation a lot of time, right?

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.720
But we actually didn't
explain why do I do that.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.760
So we are going to learn
why this is actually called

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.190
this dispersion relation.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.260
Omega is a function of k.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And in this case, in this very
simplified idealized case,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.610
omega over k is ratio.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.200
we know this is related to
the speed of propagation

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.040
of the harmonic wave is equal
to v. v is a constant that

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.010
is independent of k.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.240
This ratio is independent of k.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.160
What does that mean?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:23.410
That means if I prepare waves
with different wavenumber,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.450
or in other words, waves
with different wavelengths,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.375
they are going to propagate
at the same speed.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.669
So the speed of the
harmonic progressing wave

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.110
is independent of
the wavelength.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.780
That's actually
very good, because

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.280
in this case, if I
prepared the square pulse,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.250
as we learned before, this
square pulse is actually

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.030
a very complicated object.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.390
Square pulse is really
very complicated.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.790
You can do a Fourier
decomposition as we did before.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.715
And we need infinite
number of turns

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:11.260
of harmonic oscillating waves.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.170
We actually add them
together so that I

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.740
can produce a square pulse.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.630
And as I mentioned here, if
the dispersion relation, omega

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:30.450
over k, is is our constant,
v. That means all the

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:37.390
whatever wavelengths pulse,
which should be added together

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.790
and produce the
square pulse, are

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.490
going to be traveling
at the that speed.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:48.300
Therefore, if I have this
square pulse in the beginning,

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:54.210
after some time, t,
what I'm going to get

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.050
is that this is the original
position of the square pulse,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.220
and after some time,
t, this square pulse

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.550
will move by v times t in
the horizontal direction.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.940
And the shape of
the pulse is not

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.100
going to be changed, because no
matter what kind of wavelengths

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.530
which produce the
square pulse, all

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.535
the components in
the square pulse

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:24.600
are propagating
at the same speed.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.600
So this kind of system,
which has satisfied

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:38.430
this kind of dispersion relation
is called nondispersive media.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.240
no dispersion was
happening in this case,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.370
in this highly idealized case.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.780
We also know that in
case of the string,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.380
we are actually making
it too idealized.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.870
So if we consider a
more realistic string,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:06.240
then I have to consider an
important phenomenon, which

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.170
is--

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.620
or is a important property
of the string, for example--

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.590
stiffness

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.240
What do I mean by stiffness?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.250
So for example, if I take
a string from a piano,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:26.670
a piano string, even if
I don't apply any tension

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.060
to the string, if
I bend the string,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.590
it don't like it, all right?

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:37.240
It's going to bounce back and
restore to its original shape.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.520
So that's what I call stiffness.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.400
It's a different contribution
compared to the string tension.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.410
So what we have been discussing
so far that this distorting

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:54.000
force is actually coming
from the string tension, t.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.810
OK?

00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:00.750
What will happen if I introduce
additional contribution

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.500
from the stiffness?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.250
The stiffness is actually
not completely related

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.650
to the string
tension, and that also

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.620
wants to restore the
shape of the string.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.790
OK?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.760
Before we go to the
modeling, I would

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.220
like to take some
votes to predict

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.880
what is going to happen.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.240
How many of you were predict
that if I introduce and include

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.680
the stiffness of the
string into my equation,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.710
will the speed of
propagation increase?

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.260
How many of you think
it's going to happen?

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.780
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.280
OK.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:51.280
So some of you predict the speed
of propagation will increase.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.760
How many of you
predict that the speed

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.840
of propagation of the harmonic
wave will stay the same?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.250
How many of you?

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.640
One?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.590
OK, only one.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.720
OK, how many of you
actually predict

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:25.750
that the speed of
propagation would decrease OK

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.320
so all the other students
don't have opinion.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.350
OK, want to wait for the answer.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.980
All right.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.610
So you can see that it is
actually not completely obvious

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.710
before we solve this question.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.890
And we are going to solve it
with a simple model, which

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:52.690
actually slightly modifies
the idealized wave equation.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:58.990
So now, one semi-realistic
model which I can introduce

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.800
is to add a term additional
term to the wave equation.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.990
So I can now rewrite
my wave equation

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.630
to include the effect that to
describe a realistic string,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.850
and now this is your partial
squared psi partial t squared.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.860
This will be equal to v
squared partial squared

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.400
psi partial t squared.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.560
And the additional term,
which I put into this, again,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:36.080
is minus alpha partial to
the 4 psi partial x to the 4.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.350
And this is actually
the contribution

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.310
from the stiffness.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.160
This is stiffness.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.050
OK, so you can see that the
wave equation is now modified.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.300
And what I could do in order to
get the relation between omega

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.470
and the k--

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.260
what I could do
is that I can now

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:06.320
start with this harmonic wave
solution progressing wave

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.450
solution, plug that in to
this equation, this modified

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.090
equation, and see
what will happen.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.330
If I plug this
equation into it that

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.960
modified wave equation,
what I am going to get

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.840
is the following.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.560
So basically the left-hand, side
you're going to get minus omega

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.540
squared.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.160
And then the
right-hand side, you

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:43.190
get v squared minus k squared
and plus alpha k to the 4

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.560
in the right-hand side.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.890
OK, so of course, I can
now cancel this minus sign.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.490
This will become plus and
this will become minus.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.390
And then you can see that
the relation between omega

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:02.330
and the k is now different after
I introduce this term, which

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.610
is proportional to alpha.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:11.980
Alpha is actually describing
how stiff this string is.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.490
Of course, now I
can calculate omega

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.280
over k, which is
actually, as we learned

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.440
before, right is the
speed of the propagation

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.920
of a harmonic wave.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.900
So basically, if
I calculate omega

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.980
over k from this equation,
then basically what you get

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.230
is v square root of 1
plus alpha k squared.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.340
So if you look at this
equation, the first reaction

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.610
is, oh, now this
omega and the k ratio

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:57.780
is not a constant anymore
as a function of k.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.310
What does that mean?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.040
That means if I prepare
progressing waves

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.849
with different wavelengths
for wavenumber k,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:13.920
it's going to be propagating
at different speed, OK?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.260
Before we introduce
this into the model,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:25.440
the ratio omega and k is a
constant v, independent of k.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.170
Now, once you introduce this
model into the equation,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:35.550
and you plug in the
progressing wave solution

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.270
to actually check the
dispersion relation obtained

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:46.550
from this equation, you'll find
that the speed of progressing

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:56.110
wave depends on how distorted
this progressing wave is, OK?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:01.750
So let me compare
this to situation

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.010
in this graph, omega versus k.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.820
So we will see this dispersion
relation graph pretty often

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.250
in the class today.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.170
The y-axis is actually the
omega, angular frequency,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.990
and the k is the wavenumber,
two pi over lambda.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.410
OK.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.100
In the original
case, in the case

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.180
I have this idealized
string, obey

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.580
the wave equation
which we introduced

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.920
in the previous lectures.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.940
If I plug omega as a function
of k, what I'm getting

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.840
is a straight line.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.628
question.

00:18:44.628 --> 00:18:49.020
AUDIENCE: Why are
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.972
minus alpha [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:53.362 --> 00:18:54.570
YEN-JIE LEE: This one, right?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.980
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh, maybe I
made some mistake here.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.830
So this should be
also plus here, right.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.060
So you have this--

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:21.190
OK, so this is omega
squared, and I shouldn't have

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.890
this minus sign here, right?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.970
So this should be minus,
and this should be--

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.790
OK, let's go back to the
original equation, OK.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.820
So basically, you get--

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.180
so if I plug in this
equation to this equation,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.540
so basically I get minus
omega squared out of it.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.270
And I get minus k
squared out of this.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.190
And I'm going to get
plus k to the 4 out

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:52.560
of this partial square to
the 4 psi partial x to the 4.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.910
Therefore, this would be minus.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.200
OK, maybe I made a mistake.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.360
Thank you very much
for spotting that.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.800
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh,
yeah, I'm sorry.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.980
Not my best day today.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.500
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.020
Well, then I do it.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.150
OK.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.600
I must be drunk today.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.860
Thank you very much.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.220
Anymore mistake?

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.990
OK.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.730
Fortunately not, right?

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:26.840
OK.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.350
Very good.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.020
So let me do this again.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.610
So now I can modify my
wave equation, right?

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.110
Originally, the wave
equation is partial squared

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.810
psi partial t squared equal to
v squared partial squared psi

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.640
partial x squared.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.470
And now I add additional
term, which is actually

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:55.100
proportional to the partial to
the 4 psi partial x to the 4.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.620
OK, if I add this
term into again.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:03.560
And now I plug in the wave
equation, the progressing wave

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.040
solution, into this
equation, and I

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.020
would get this formula, OK?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.960
So now everything
should be correct,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.380
and I have clear evidence
that everybody's following.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.030
So that is very good.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.080
And now, I can now cancel
all the minus sign,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.090
right and then it's become plus.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.100
And now I can actually
calculate what

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.700
would be the speed
of propagation

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.470
for this specific
harmonic progressing wave

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.040
and omega over k will be
equal to v square root of 1

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.260
plus alpha k squared.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.910
OK?

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.810
Thank you very much
for the contribution.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:49.310
And then now we see that
here this ratio depends on k.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:55.280
So if I plug this on top of
the previous curve, which

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.310
is actually obtained from here,
then what I'm going to get

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.340
is something like this.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.942
In the beginning
it's pretty close

00:22:05.942 --> 00:22:08.900
to the nondispersive case.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:14.720
And it goes up, because of
this alpha contribution.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.740
Alpha is actually a
positive number in my model.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.780
And the k is actually
the wavenumber.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.170
So what is going to happen
is that basically after you

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.920
include stiffness, the
slope of this curve

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.630
is changing as a function of k.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.130
OK?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.010
What do I learn
from this exercise

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:49.010
is that if I increase k,
if I have a very large k--

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:55.620
that means I have a very small
lambda, because k is actually

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.200
2 pi over lambda.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.860
OK?

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.060
So that means I'm looking at
something really distorted

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.630
like this.

00:23:05.572 --> 00:23:09.830
Both string tension
and the stiffness

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:16.020
wants to restore the
string back to normal.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.500
Therefore, what is
happening is that you

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.840
are going to get
additional restoring force.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.350
Therefore, as we actually
calculate to here

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:33.260
if alpha is actually positive,
then the velocity actually

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.770
increased with respect
to what we actually

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.530
get before we actually
had this into a model.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.710
So I think that makes sense,
because the stiffness also

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.850
wants to restore the distortion.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:55.520
Therefore, you have larger
and larger restoring force.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.920
Therefore, the
speed of propagation

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.090
of this harmonic
wave will increase.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.790
so that's pretty nice.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.670
But what does that
mean to our project?

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.100
OK, our project is
to send information

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.630
from one place to the
other place, right?

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.460
So what we just discussed
is that we can actually

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.440
send a square pulse
and let it propagate.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.360
A square pulse can be decomposed
into many, many pieces--

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.155
many, many harmonic waves.

00:24:31.155 --> 00:24:32.630
OK?

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:39.050
Before the square pulse
works, because all the waves

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:44.150
with different
wavelengths should

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.775
be moving at this constant
speed, independent

00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:49.190
of the wavelengths.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.650
Now we are in trouble.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:58.040
As you can see here, now the
speed, which is omega over k

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.200
depends on the
wavenumber or wavelength.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.460
Therefore, different
components, which

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:12.110
actually are needed to
create a square pulse,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.000
are going to be propagating
at different speed.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.550
You can say, oh, come on,
this is actually mathematics,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.340
so I don't believe you.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.440
A square pulse is
a square pulse,

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.910
and that's mathematics,
that's math department.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.850
But we can actually really
see that in the experiment.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.060
OK?

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.050
So that's-- take a look
at this demonstration.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.940
Maybe you didn't
notice that before,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.830
but we have seen this effect
from the previous lectures.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.685
OK, so I can now
create a square--

00:25:43.685 --> 00:25:46.900
not really a square pulse, but
actually some kind of pulse.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.500
OK I can create some
kind of pulse like this.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.340
OK?

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.240
And as we learned before,
when this pulse pass

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.230
through an open end, it's
going to be bounced back.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.780
so therefore, I can have--

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.140
I can actually show you this
demo in a limited set-up.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.420
But this pulse is going to be
going back and forth, because I

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.870
have open end, as
we've discussed before.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.810
What is going to happen
is that since we have

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.950
a realistic system,
what is going to happen

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:27.420
is that this pulse will
become wider and wider, right?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.370
That's the prediction
coming from this equation.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.840
Different component with
different wavelengths

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.000
is going to be propagating
at different speed.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.600
Therefore this pulse is
going to become wider,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.680
and we can see that.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.950
OK, so let me quickly produce a
pulse and see what will happen.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.170
OK.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.020
Originally, it's
actually really sharp.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:57.030
And you can see that really
the width of the pulse

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.040
become wider and wider.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.430
And at some point, it disappear.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.400
If I have a very long set-up,
what you are going to see

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.550
is that it's going
to be propagating

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.100
toward the same direction.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.190
And the width of the
pulse is actually

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.460
going to be increasing
as a function of time.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.400
Let's take a look at this again.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.100
Now, this time we
have a negative pulse.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.540
You sort of see--

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.432
very similar, see.

00:27:25.432 --> 00:27:26.890
And also you can
see that there are

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:33.420
some strange vibration actually
left behind the main pulse.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:41.520
So that means harmonic waves
with different wavelengths

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.080
really propagating
at different speed.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.900
And for that, to
demonstrate this effect,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.870
I also prepared
some demonstration,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:58.000
which actually are based
on our calculation, OK.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.160
So you can say that, OK, now I'm
convinced I can see dispersion

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.170
in the experiment.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.830
How do I know this
calculation actually match

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.360
with the experimental
data, right?

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.955
How about we really run
a simulation and see what

00:28:14.955 --> 00:28:16.180
would happen.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:22.920
So what this example actually
do is, in the beginning,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.500
you would do
integration like crazy

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.040
in order to get all the
components calculated.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.640
Then it's going to
propagate all those pulses--

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.840
all those pulse with different
components through the medium,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.620
OK?

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.080
And then there will be
two different colors,

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.840
one is actually blue, which
is the original shape.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.110
The other one is
actually the one

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.110
which is stiffness turned up.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.220
So now, in the beginning
I can set the alpha value

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.200
to be 0.02 and see
what will happen.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.870
And I will put produce
triangular pulse.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.860
You can see that now.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.380
The program is really
working very hard

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.930
to capture all the components
from 1 to 199 and equal to 1

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.460
until 99.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.810
And then now, these
individual components

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.580
are propagating
through the medium.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.490
And you can see that
originally the shape is like--

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.050
the blue shape--
triangular shape.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.470
And you can see that
is a function of time.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.640
The pulse become
wider and wider, OK?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.200
Now, of course, I can
increase the alpha to 0.02

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.910
and see what happen--

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.550
from 0.02 to 0.2 and
see what will happen.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:48.050
You should expect a
much larger dispersion.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.450
And you can see that
now in the beginning,

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.560
it's doing the integration.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.890
And you can see that this
time because the alpha

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.640
is actually larger.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.110
Therefore, you see that this
effect, this broadening,

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.350
is actually happening
earlier, and it

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.640
become broader and
broader, and that there

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.120
are a lot of strange
structures, as you can see also

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.250
from the demo, produce because
different components are

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.070
actually propagating
at different speeds.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.560
So of course, we are MIT, so
in this course we have MIT--

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.290
MIT waves.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.460
So let's take a look at the MIT
wave and see what will happen.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.240
Now you see that there
are very sharp edge, which

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.680
actually require really a lot
of effort to reproduce that.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.320
And you can see that
MIT is kind of distorted

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.140
as a function of time.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.775
We can kind of still
identify the peak,

00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:51.270
but it's actually now displaced.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.900
And in the end of
the simulation,

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.356
you can not even
recognize that's actually

00:30:57.356 --> 00:31:03.540
originally MIT signal, which
was sent from your source.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.790
So what I want to say is that
this effect, this dispersion

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.980
effect, is really
an enemy, which

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.570
is actually very dangerous.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.790
And that actually
will prevent us

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.390
from sending high
quality signals.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.890
OK, any questions
about all those demos?

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.108
Yes.

00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:32.052
AUDIENCE: Why do we
model the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.972
YEN-JIE LEE: So this is because
the stiffness is actually

00:31:40.972 --> 00:31:41.680
symmetric, right.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.535
So if you bend the
string, then there

00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:52.820
are contribution from the
positive and negative part, OK?

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:57.520
If you have partial to the
3, partial to the x to the 3

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.710
component, then it's going to
be a symmetric and so actually

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.110
against our physics intuition.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.960
And also, in this
modeling, you also

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.490
match with our experimental
data pretty well.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.270
OK.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.990
Very good question.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.760
And on the other hand, we now
consider then the stiffness.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.270
you can also go back to
the infinite number coupled

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.740
oscillator case.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:28.190
If you instead take an
example which is actually not

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.600
super small displacement
approximation,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.580
you take the next to
leading order term.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.580
Then you will see that the
partial to the 3 partial x

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.540
to the 3 term as you cancel
because it's symmetric,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.200
or so I argued.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.860
And then you will be able to
also obtain this tern when

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.390
you have slightly larger
displacement with respect

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.590
to the equilibrium position.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.190
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.981
Any other question?

00:32:58.981 --> 00:33:00.098
Yes?

00:33:00.098 --> 00:33:03.930
AUDIENCE: If you were looking at
[INAUDIBLE],, for example, what

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.037
would be [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:08.037 --> 00:33:09.953
YEN-JIE LEE: When you
pass through the medium.

00:33:09.953 --> 00:33:12.510
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.010
YEN-JIE LEE: A
molecule can actually

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:18.270
change the speed of
different wavelengths,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.980
actually, differently, right?

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.450
Very good question.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.260
OK, so very good.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.580
We got two questions, and
we can see that if I now

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.260
turn on the alpha and make
the alpha value large,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.940
then you can see that the
information is distorted.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:41.030
And this involve
infinite number of terms.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.610
And in this case, in this
new demo which I show here,

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.200
I have alpha value equal to 0.2.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.260
Therefore, the
effect of dispersion

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.170
is actually much larger
than what you showed before.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.690
And then you can see that
this MIT wave quickly

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:02.230
become something like a
Gaussian-like wave, right?

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.630
OK, so very good.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:11.370
So you can say, OK, you
are making an example--

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:16.090
it's a very interesting example,
but it involve too many terms.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:21.120
You have infinite number
of progressing waves

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.739
in this example.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:25.590
It's very difficult
to understand.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:31.989
How about we go back to a
much simpler example, OK?

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:37.290
What we can do is
that instead of going

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:42.570
through infinite number
of harmonic waves, now

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.750
we just consider two waves,
and overlap these two

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.520
waves together and
see what will happen.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.290
And let's see what
we can learn from it,

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:58.360
because the required number of
harmonic wave to describe such

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.170
a pulse is too complicated.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.980
So you can say that, OK, now
let's just consider two waves

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.600
and see what we can
learn from this.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.570
And this is actually what
I am going to do now.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.050
So from Bolek's
lecture I hope that he

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.850
covered the beat phenomenon.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.230
So basically, what is it?

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.590
A beat phenomenon?

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.380
Beat phenomenon happens
when you overlap

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.100
two waves, two harmonic waves.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:31.450
They have pretty
close wavelengths.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.800
OK, but they're not the same.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.980
And now, if you add
two waves together,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.730
that's actually what
you are going to get.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.880
You are going to get something
which is oscillating really,

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.740
really fast, which is
basically called the carrier.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.570
And also you can see that the
magnitude of the oscillation

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.910
is actually changing as
a function of position,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.020
and that we call envelope.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.940
So that's essentially
the beat phenomenon,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.740
which you learned from
previous lectures.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:13.070
So in this example, I'm going
to add two waves together.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.920
So the first wave
is described by--

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.230
OK, is denoted by side one.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:23.020
It's a function of x and t,
and it has a function of form

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.740
A is the amplitude.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:32.580
And the sine k1
x minus omega1 t.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.050
This is actually
a progressing wave

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.360
propagating toward
the right-hand side

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.330
of the board, the positive
direction of the x-axis

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.500
in my coordinate system.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:50.850
And it has a wavenumber of k1
and angular frequency omega1

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.230
And I can also write
down my second wave,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.950
which I would like to
overlap with the first wave.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.830
So this is actually having
exactly the same amplitude,

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:06.030
which is A. And it is
described by a sine function,

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:14.110
and you have a wavenumber
k2 x minus omega2 t, angular

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.620
frequency omega2.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:22.260
With these two equations,
we can calculate

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.520
the speed of propagation for
the individual waves, right?

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.160
So the first one,
I can calculate

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.350
the speed of propagation
v1 would be equal to omega1

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.420
over k1.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.600
Very similarly, you
can also calculate

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.100
the speed of propagation
for the second wave,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.260
which is omega2 over k2.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.515
So now what I'm going
to do is to calculate

00:37:48.515 --> 00:37:50.870
a sum of these two waves.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:56.900
So I have the total, which is
psi is equal to psi1 plus psi2.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.530
So what I'm going to do is
to overlap these two waves

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.980
and see what will happen.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.310
And for that, I
need this formula,

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:11.560
which is a sine A
plus sine B. And this

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:21.670
would be equal to 2 times sine
A plus B over 2 and sine--

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.200
it would become cosine here--

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:30.990
cosine A minus B over 2.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.660
So if I use that formula,
basically what I'm going to get

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.410
is--

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.780
we have two times
from the formula.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:50.430
So if you have 2A sine
k1 plus k2 over 2x

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:56.850
minus omega1 plus omega2 over 2.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.540
So basically, the first
term is the sine function.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.150
The sine function
and the content

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:07.840
is actually A plus B. Therefore,
you add these two together,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.170
divide it by two,
then basically this

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.260
is as actually what you obtain.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.530
The second term
is a cosine term.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.370
You get a cosine here.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.450
But now you calculate
A minus B, which

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:25.520
is this term minus
that term divided by 2.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.850
Then basically what you
get is k1 minus k2 divided

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:36.570
by 2 times x minus omega1
minus omega2 over 2 t.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.540
OK, so now this actually--

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:46.140
what would happen if you add
these two waves together?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.540
Until now, everything is exact.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.770
And I would like to add
additional conditions

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:01.360
or additional assumptions
when I discuss this solution.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.200
OK?

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.670
So how about in order to
produce the beat phenomenon,

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:11.110
I need to make the
wavelengths very, very

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.140
similar between the two waves.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.060
So therefore, what
I am going to do

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:22.090
is that I'm going
to assume k1 is

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.770
very close to k2 is roughly k.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:33.220
And because of this, since I
have a continuous function,

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.270
if k1 is really
close to k2, that

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:41.680
means omega1 is going to be also
very close to omega2, right?

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.010
So what I'm going
to get is omega1 is

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.820
going to be also very
similar to omega2,

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.760
and I will call it omega.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:41:02.230
So if I do this, when I
have very similar k1 and k2,

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.760
what is going to happen?

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:11.050
What is going to happen is that
k1 minus k2 will be very small.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:18.250
So this very small k
means larger wavelengths.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:24.870
Therefore, this cosine term
will become the envelope,

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.560
because it's actually a
slowly variating amplitude

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.240
as a function of position,
because the k is very small.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.070
K is small means lambda large.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.910
Therefore, the
amplitude is going

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.420
to be having this
modulation, which is actually

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:48.977
like the envelope, that the
oscillation of this envelope

00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:50.560
is actually controlled
by the k, okay?

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.380
Let's look at the
left-hand side term.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.280
k1 plus k2 over 2 is
kind of like calculating

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:08.320
the average of the wavenumber
of the first and second wave.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.100
So if you calculate our average,
you can be still pretty large.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:19.180
Therefore, you have small lambda
compared to the difference.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.970
Therefore, you see
that that actually

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.115
contribute to those little
structures in this graph,

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:26.380
and it's called carrier.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.111
Yes?

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.073
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:34.326
If k1 were a lot bigger
than k2, then [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.910
YEN-JIE LEE: So they
can be different.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.920
Yeah, so you are
absolutely right.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.130
So you can produce
something like a carrier

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.480
even when k1 is not
equal to k2, right?

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.470
Its just a average.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.050
You're right.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:43:00.130
But then on the other hand,
the difference, k1 and k2

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.040
will be also large.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.570
Therefore, it's
not as easy as what

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.370
we have been doing here to
identify who is the carrier

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.220
and who is the envelope.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.630
But you do get
some kind of graph,

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.370
which is oscillating
really fast,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.550
but the envelope is going to
be also oscillating very fast.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.660
That is harder to see
all the structure.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.210
But you're absolutely
right, yes.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.740
Very good question.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.320
So now I have this set-up.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.180
I assume that they are
very close to each other.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.320
So now I can define
phase velocity.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.660
Finally, we define what is
actually the phase velocity.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.650
In The phase velocity--

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.570
I call it vp--

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.220
you can see that
before I already

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.400
have been using
phase velocity vp

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.060
for the previous discussions.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.280
In the case of
nondispersive medium,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.070
the phase velocity is
just a vp, which is

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.170
the velocity in the equation.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:09.140
And in this case, vp will
be equal to omega over k,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.254
as we discussed before.

00:44:10.254 --> 00:44:11.670
And that's actually
the definition

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.320
of this phase velocity.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.350
And I can now also define
the group velocity.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:31.340
The group velocity is actually
the velocity of the envelope.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.140
I can calculate the
velocity of the envelope.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.030
in the case of
phase velocity, I'm

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.590
calculating the
velocity of the carrier.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.790
I'm taking a ratio
of the average,

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.800
and actually the average
is so close to k and omega,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.620
therefore the phase
velocity vp would

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.710
be just the speed of the
propagation of the carrier,

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.750
which is actually omega over k.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.060
I call it vp.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:04.040
And in case of group
velocity, I call it vg.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.210
vg is describing the speed of
propagation of the envelope.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:16.220
Therefore, what I am getting
is omega1 minus omega2

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.770
divided by k1 minus k2.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.220
Both of them have
effect of 1 over 2,

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.940
which we say is canceled.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.220
And when they are really
so close to each other,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.161
this is actually
roughly like d omega dk.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.770
Any questions so far?

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.140
So we have derived two
different kinds of speed.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.710
One is actually related to
the phase velocity, which is--

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:54.790
one is actually called
the phase velocity.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:59.260
It's related to the
speed of the carrier.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.620
The other one is group velocity,
which is actually related

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.340
to the speed of the envelope.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:12.080
So let me describe you a
few interesting examples.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.470
And let's see what we can
actually learn from this.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.820
In the first example, I'm
working on a non dispersive

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.320
medium, OK?

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:33.430
If I have a
nondispersive medium,

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.960
then basically what
I'm going to get

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.970
is that omega will
be proportional to k.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:45.410
If I plot omega versus
k, it's a straight line.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.310
Now, if I have omega--

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.780
I choose the omega of
the two, omega1, omega2,

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.830
of the two waves--

00:46:54.830 --> 00:47:03.250
to be roughly equal to omega
0, I can now evaluate the vp.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:11.290
The vp will be the
slope of this point

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.390
on the slope of
a line connecting

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:17.570
the 0 to that point, which
is actually the omega over k,

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.070
right?

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.445
So that's actually
the definition

00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:21.430
of the phase velocity.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.450
I would get this slope.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.480
The slope of this
line is actually

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.830
related to the phase velocity.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.740
I can also calculate
the slope of a line cuts

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.770
through this point.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.610
But as it cuts through this
curve, and in this case,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:50.080
I'm also going to get a
line overlapping with phase

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.040
velocity, because in
this case, omega over k

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.360
is a constant, which is
v. Therefore, no matter

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.290
what you calculate,
if you calculate vp

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:07.210
as a ratio of omega and a k,
where you calculate vg, which

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.910
is actually the slope
of the line cutting

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:15.820
through that point, is
you always get actually v.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.950
Therefore, what we
learned from here

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:23.980
is that for a nondispersive
medium, vp will be equal to vg.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.850
That means both of
these two curves,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:37.120
both of the curve of envelope,
describing the envelope

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.950
and then describing
the carrier, is

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.850
going to be propagating
at the same speed.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:43.580
OK, any questions?

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:51.230
So the whole thing is going to
be moving at constant speed.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:59.560
For that, I can now show you
some example, which I prepared,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.460
some simulation
which I prepared.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.060
So what it does is
that it really--

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.410
oh, wait a second.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:25.510
This is 0.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:31.540
OK, so this is the case when
I have a nondispersive medium.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.810
if I have a nondispersive
medium, what is going to happen

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:40.380
is that both the carrier,
which is the speed of all

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.000
those little structures,
and the envelope

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.210
is going to be propagating
at the same speed.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.250
So you can see the high
is like a fixed pattern.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.700
It's propagating toward
the right-hand side.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.330
And the relative motion
between the defined structure

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.000
and the envelope is actually 0.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.750
So basically you have
exactly the same pattern

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.820
as a function of time.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:09.070
So now I'm going to move away
from the nondispersive medium.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.620
How about we discuss
what would happen

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.600
if we have considered the
stiffness of the string

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.730
and see what we get from there.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:27.760
So if I plugged omega
as a function of k,

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.450
and consider alpha
to be non-zero.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.990
It's a positive value.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:36.930
So if I have alpha to
be a positive value,

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.560
non-zero, in this case, I'm
going to get a curve like this.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:50.970
The slope is actually
changing and it's curving up

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.840
because if you
have k large, then

00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.150
you would see that the ratio of
omega and k actually increase.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:01.870
So this is actually
the kind of curve

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:06.690
which we would get
if I set the omega

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:12.150
of the first and
second wave of interest

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:16.080
in this study to be omega 0.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.660
Then basically, what you
are going to get is that--

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.340
OK, now I have this
point here on the curve.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.492
If I calculate the
phase velocity--

00:51:27.492 --> 00:51:29.700
the phase velocity, how
do I calculate that?

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:37.010
I can now connect 0 and
the point by a line.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.220
And I can now calculate
the slope of this line,

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.510
and I can get the
phase velocity, vp.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:51.500
On the other hand,
I can also calculate

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.550
the slope of a line
cutting through, tangential

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:59.030
to the point of interest.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:04.560
And that is going to give
me the group velocity.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.100
As you can see from here,
which slope is actually larger?

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.140
Anybody know?

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.670
Can point it out?

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.450
Group velocity's larger, right?

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.750
So in this case, if I
turn on alpha greater

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.410
than 0, what is going to
happen is that, since the group

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:27.060
velocity is larger than the
phase velocity, that means,

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.310
if I go back to that
picture, the envelope

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.850
is going to be moving faster
than the fine structure

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.440
inside the envelope.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.170
How about we take a
five-minute break from here?

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:42.816
And then we continue the
discussion after the break.

00:52:42.816 --> 00:52:44.190
It's a good time
to take a break.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.140
Welcome back, everybody.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.180
So we will continue
the discussion

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.310
of the beat phenomenon.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:02.431
So what we have shown you is
that, based on those curves,

00:53:02.431 --> 00:53:03.930
actually can actually
determine what

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:06.030
will be the relative velocity--

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:15.220
what would be the velocity of
the carrier, which is actually

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.470
denoted by vp,
and the what would

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:23.390
be the velocity of the
envelope, which is actually

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:28.170
denoted by our group velocity.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:33.480
And in this case, what
I'm actually plotting here

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.950
is that, in this case,
because alpha is actually

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:43.620
greater than 0, therefore, this
curve is actually curving up.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.850
Therefore, you have
larger group velocity

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.010
compared to the phase velocity.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.360
So what you would expect
is that the envelope

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.110
is going to be
actually progressing

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:03.930
at a speed higher than
the speed of the carrier.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.520
On the other hand,
if magically I

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.310
can construct some
kind of medium which

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.720
can be described
in this situation,

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.270
alpha smaller than 0,
what is going to happen?

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:26.800
So if I plot a situation
with alpha smaller than 0,

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.690
so now I plot omega
was a function of k.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.890
What is going to happen is
that this-- so basically,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.760
you have something which is
actually curving downward.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:51.750
So if I now, again, work on
some point of interest here,

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:57.050
you can see that the slope
of the phase velocity

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:08.570
is now actually larger than
the slope, which is actually

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.210
from the line
cutting through the--

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:15.350
tangential to the
curve, which is actually

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:20.510
getting you the group velocity.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.890
So in the case of
alpha's more than 0,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:25.940
which is some
strange medium I can

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.290
which I can create
from whatever, plasma,

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:35.060
or some really strange new
kind of material of interest.

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.410
If that happens, then that
means your group velocity

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.478
will be smoother than
the phase velocity.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.560
And if you look at
this point here,

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:57.790
you can see that this curve
actually reach a maxima here.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:02.140
And if you actually are
operating at this point, what

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.910
is going to happen?

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:08.650
What is going to happen is
that if you calculate the group

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.610
velocity, what
will be the value?

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.367
It will be 0.

00:56:13.367 --> 00:56:14.200
What does that mean?

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.280
That means the envelope
will not be moving a lot,

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.910
but the carriers
are still moving.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:28.190
So at this point,
you are going to get

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:31.130
group velocity equal to 0.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:41.750
And finally, the if you
actually going to a very large k

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:45.520
value in this scenario,
alpha smaller than 0,

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.020
you will see that
even you can have

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:56.460
phase velocity, vp, positive,
because it's actually

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.400
a positive slope.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:06.520
And that the group velocity
actually is negative.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.920
What does that mean?

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:13.660
That means you are going to see
a situation that the carriers

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:17.630
are progressing in the
positive direction,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:24.910
and the envelope is
going to be progressing

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:29.440
in the negative
direction, probably

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.490
progressing to the
left-hand side of the board.

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.910
So what does that mean?

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:40.820
That means this wave is doing
what Michael Jackson's doing.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.875
It's actually
doing the moonwalk.

00:57:42.875 --> 00:57:45.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:48.880
So this is actually
the kind of thing

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.110
which could have happened,
that it looks like

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:57.910
and that you are doing--

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:03.280
going forward, because
all the carriers

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.460
are moving in a
positive direction.

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.660
But the body is actually going
toward negative direction.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.882
maybe I can also learn
moonwalk at some point.

00:58:13.882 --> 00:58:15.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:16.630
OK.

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.490
So let's go back to
the demonstration

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:24.160
which I got started, and
somehow I got messed up.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.210
So let's take a look
at the demo again so

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:33.820
let's look at all the
different situation at once.

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.880
So in this case, as
we discussed before,

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.680
this is actually happening in
the nondispersive situation.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.680
In this situation, you
have a straight line,

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.590
nondispersed medium
actually give you

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:53.590
always the group velocity
equal to phase velocity.

00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:58.870
So that means the
carrier and the envelope

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:02.650
is going to be moving
in the same direction

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:04.540
at the same speed.

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:11.590
On the other hand,
in this case, we

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:16.690
can actually have a situation
that the phase velocity

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:20.890
is actually faster than
the group velocity.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.770
So what I mean is actually
the situation here.

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:28.120
The phase velocity calculated
from a line connecting from 0

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.500
to that point is actually
having a larger slope compared

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.070
to the tangential line.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.770
And you see this situation.

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:41.310
So basically, you see
that inside the envelope

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:44.230
all those carriers are
actually moving faster

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:45.778
than the envelope.

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.950
Now I can have a dispersive
medium where the group

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.650
velocity is equal to 0.

00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:02.230
So what is going to happen
is that really the envelope

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.400
is actually not moving.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.340
It's not like this.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.060
The body is not moving.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:12.245
So you have some carriers
inside this structure

01:00:12.245 --> 01:00:14.600
is actually moving forward.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.148
But the envelope is
actually not moving.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:29.950
So, finally the last situation
is really interesting.

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:33.800
So in this situation,
this is actually

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.840
having the group velocity--

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.860
the group velocity is actually
having difference sine

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.060
compared to the phase velocity.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.610
So you can see that the whole
structure of the envelope

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:51.910
is actually moving backwards.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:54.790
But the carrier
is actually moving

01:00:54.790 --> 01:01:01.380
in the positive direction
in this example.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:08.950
So this is actually what we
have learned from this beat

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.390
phenomenon, and
then we have covered

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.020
the idea of phase velocity
and the group velocity.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.460
So how about bound
system how do we

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.380
understand when we
have a bound system?

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.600
And how does that evolve
as a function of time?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.530
So if I have a system of
two walls and one string,

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.350
and of course, I
give you the density

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:41.660
for the unit length and the
string tension, and also

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.330
the alpha, which is
actually telling you

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:47.780
about the stiffness
of the system.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:53.390
Again, I can write
down psi xt to be

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:59.530
the sum of all the normal
mode from one to infinity,

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:11.196
A m sine km x plus alpha m
sine omega mt plus beta m.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:19.650
And then what we can
do is that we can first

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:23.280
get the initial
conditions of this system,

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.040
and those are the boundary
conditions of this system.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.480
That we actually just follow
exactly the same procedure

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.000
to obtain all the
unknown coefficients

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.845
that we would be able to evolve
this system as a function

01:02:34.845 --> 01:02:38.340
of time, as I have demonstrated
to you in the beginning

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.080
of the lecture.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.070
So in this case, you can
have two boundary conditions.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.490
One is actually say
at x equal to 0.

01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.810
And the other one is
actually at x equal to L.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:54.070
In those boundaries,
as we actually

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.750
learned before, because
the endpoints are

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.910
fixed on the wall.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:07.680
Therefore, psi of
0 at that time, t,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.670
will be always equal to 0 for
the left-hand side boundary

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.370
condition.

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.640
And very similarly, as
we discussed before,

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.440
psi of L t will be equal to 0 if
you look at the right-hand side

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.650
of the wall--

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.670
of the system.

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:28.940
So I don't want to repeat
this, because this is actually

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.440
exactly the same calculation
which we have done before.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.740
So with these two
boundary conditions,

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:44.660
we can actually conclude that k
m will be equal to m pi over L,

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.090
and alpha m will be equal to 0.

01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:55.690
So you can actually go
back and check this out.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.350
So what I'm going to
say is that until now,

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:02.640
what we have been doing
is identical to what

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.120
we have been doing for
the nondispersive media.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.380
What I'm to say is that the
shape of the normal mode

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.940
is actually set by the
boundary condition.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.710
It's determined by the
boundary condition,

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.500
and it has actually,
so far, nothing

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.950
to do with the
dispersion relation omega

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:27.810
as a function of k.

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:31.350
So in short, boundary
condition can give you

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:33.690
the shape of the normal
mode, and that we

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.975
know that the first normal
mode, second normal mode,

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:40.380
et cetera, et
cetera, is actually

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:46.440
going to be identical to the
case of nondispersive medium.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.890
so that's actually the first
thing which we learned.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:54.270
The second thing we learned
is that OK, now what we see

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:58.860
is that once the boundary
condition is given,

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.610
then the k m is
actually also given.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:07.020
Therefore, since I have the
dispersion relation omega

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.055
as a function of
k, as shown there.

01:05:11.055 --> 01:05:14.610
Omega over k is equal to
v times square root of 1

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.130
plus alpha k squared.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:24.480
Therefore, once k m is
given, omega m is also given.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:32.370
So you can see that that's
actually where the dispersion

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:33.970
relation come into play.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:42.290
The omega m will be different if
you compare the dispersive case

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.560
and nondispersive case.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.470
So that is actually
what I want to say.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:52.520
The k m, which is the
shape of the normal mode,

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.690
doesn't depend on the
dispersion relation.

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:00.480
On the other hand, the
speed of the oscillation,

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.020
the angular frequency,
omega, depends

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.690
on the dispersion
relation, which is actually

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:11.260
what we obtained from there.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:20.795
If I start to plot omega
m as a function of k m--

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.240
so in the case of
nondispersive medium,

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.240
so what am I going to get
is actually discrete points

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.790
along a straight line.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:42.460
This is actually k1,
k2, k3, k4, et cetera.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:50.430
They are actually all sitting
on a common straight line.

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:56.640
If you look at the relative
difference between k1, k2,

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.860
and k3, they are constant
according to this formula.

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.180
The difference between
k1 and k2 is pi over 2.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.190
k2 and k3 is actually
also pi over 2--

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:12.300
pi over L. It's
always a fixed number.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:16.620
And since omega is
actually proportional to k.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:24.640
Therefore, the spacing between
omega 1, omega 2, omega 3,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.900
is also constant.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:34.080
In short, omega 2,
omega 3, and omega 4,

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.080
et cetera is always
multiple times

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.240
what you get from omega
1, according to this graph

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:48.200
and in the case of
nondispersive medium.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.280
So what does that mean?

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:56.690
That means OK, now if I
have a very complicated

01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:59.490
initial condition--

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:02.030
this is actually what I have,
an initial condition-- very

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.130
complicated.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:06.030
I just need to wait.

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.930
If this is actually
nondispersive medium,

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:16.100
I just have to wait until p
equal to 2 pi over omega 1.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.439
Then the system would restore
to its original shape.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.450
That's actually what
I can learn from here,

01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:30.700
because omega 2, omega 3, and
any higher order normal modes,

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.809
the angular frequency is
actually multiple times

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:34.910
of what I get from omega 1.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:43.200
On the other hand, if
I consider a situation

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.510
of dispersive medium--

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:55.210
you can see that now the
difference between omega m

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:58.149
is now the constant.

01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:01.250
So what you would predict
is that it would take much,

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.880
much longer for this
system to go back

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:10.840
to the original shape compared
to nondispersive media.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.380
So that actually you
can actually see.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:20.500
In a real-life experiment,
I can distort this equipment

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.680
in this boundless
system, and it's actually

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.640
going to take forever or
impossible to come back

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.850
to the original shape,
because of that dispersion.

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.399
On the other hand, if
I have a really highly

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:37.510
idealized situation, if
I have both ends bound,

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:43.040
and I just have to wait until
t equal to 2 pi over omega 1.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.399
Then this system will go
back to the original shape.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:56.100
Before I end the
lecture today, I

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:01.050
would like to discuss with
you two interesting issues.

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:06.360
So many of you have
seen water waves,

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.120
and Feynman actually
told us in his lecture

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.460
that water waves are really
easily seen by everybody,

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.520
but it's actually the
worst possible example.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.400
That's the bad news-- the
worst possible example

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.960
because it has all the
possible complications

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.760
that waves can have.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.060
That's the bad news.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.176
The good news is that you are
going to do that in your P set.

01:10:31.176 --> 01:10:32.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.080
So we will be able to understand
the behavior of the water

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.280
waves.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.230
So that's the good news.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.530
The second thing which I
would like to talk about

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.300
is phase velocity.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:52.170
You can say, OK, you say that
phase velocity or harmonic

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:54.980
waves doesn't send
information, right?

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.830
And how do I actually know that?

01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:59.430
Right?

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:00.660
So what does that mean?

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.930
OK, so let's take this
horrible example of water wave.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:09.520
OK, so the black line
is actually the beach,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.550
and there is a water wave
from the ocean approaching

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:15.420
the beach.

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.820
And you can see
that you can have

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.960
some kind of angle between
the insert of water wave

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.980
and the line of the beach.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:28.950
What I can actually
do is that I can now

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:37.860
measure the shape of the water
wave at the edge of the beach.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.430
And I would see that, huh,
now the phase velocity

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:45.660
which I observe
there is actually

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.940
faster than the speed of
propagation of the water wave,

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:56.040
because of this
inserted angle, OK?

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.830
I can actually make
it very, very fast.

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:05.460
I can make the speed
actually even faster

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.550
than the speed of light.

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:09.041
Right?

01:12:09.041 --> 01:12:15.570
I can now decrease
the theta to 0.

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:19.420
Then you will have
a phase velocity

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.560
which is faster than
the speed of light.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.740
It goes to infinity.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.110
But does that mean anything?

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.880
Actually, that
doesn't mean anything,

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.480
because I don't really move
the water from a specific point

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.570
to another point
infinitely fast.

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:40.880
Therefore, what I want
to say is that, OK,

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.280
you can do whatever you want
to make a fancy phase velocity.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.610
But that will not
help you with sending

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:52.540
things close to the
speed of light or greater

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.230
than the speed of light.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.630
So as you can see
from this example,

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:59.610
I can easily construct
a simple example,

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:03.050
which you see that is actually
really not sending anything

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.850
from one place to the other.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:09.540
But you still have really,
really fast phase velocity.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.580
OK, thank you very
much, everybody,

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.990
for the attention and hope
you enjoyed the lecture.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:19.650
And if you have any
questions, please let me know.

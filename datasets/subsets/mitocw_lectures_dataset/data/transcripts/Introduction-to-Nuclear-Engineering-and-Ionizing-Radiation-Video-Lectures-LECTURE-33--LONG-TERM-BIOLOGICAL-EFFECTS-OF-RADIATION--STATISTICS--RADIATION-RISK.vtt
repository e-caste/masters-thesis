00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:23.690
MICHAEL SHORT: So
as a quick review

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.180
of all the different
biological effects,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.080
we've pretty much
taken it up to here.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.870
We've explained the
physical and chemical stages

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.730
of what happens when
radiation interacts

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.970
with mostly bags of water with
some solutes in them, better

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.300
known as organisms at
dynamic equilibrium.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.590
Everything from the sort of
femptosecond level, ionization

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.450
of water almost
certainly, because that's

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.240
most of what
biological things are,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.610
to the formation of many, many,
many, many, many different

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.260
radiolysis byproducts eventually
that end up as just a few

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.840
that we care about, the
longer-lived radiolytic

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.200
byproducts that will
then diffuse away

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.600
from the original
damage cascades

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.490
and go on to eat something
else, likely DNA or something

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.680
that you don't want to get
oxidized or chemically changed.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.797
We talked a little bit
about radiolysis in reactors

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:23.630
and how you can actually
measure it directly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.470
which was only done really a few
years ago which is pretty cool.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.270
Just to remind you
of this experiment,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.250
there's a tiny
high-pressure cell

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.270
of high-pressure,
high-temperature water.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.130
There is a foil sample with a
very thin region and protons

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.100
firing through it, so that
they both irradiate the sample

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.690
and induce radiolysis in
the water at the same time.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.640
And this way, you can test
the effect of radiolysis

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430
in the water here versus just
plain, old, high-pressure,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.410
high-temperature corrosion here.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.510
And the results are
pretty striking,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.600
where you can clearly see
the boundary where the proton

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.380
beam was as well as
the increased thickness

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.630
of the oxide and corrosion
layer formed when radiolysis

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.650
is turned on, so to speak.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.820
We went through DNA damage, and
we ended with pseudoscience.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.710
So I want to bring up a couple--

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.590
no, we don't have time for that.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.133
But we spent the last 15
minutes of class railing

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.800
against pseudoscience and making
sure that you check your facts,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.342
but we pointed out
a number of things

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:26.430
wrong with some of the studies.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.940
So aside from just that
guy misreading everything

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.820
on that entire blog, of
the studies that you felt

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.260
weren't very convincing, what
do you remember about them?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.900
Some of those studies were
totally fine, but some of them

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.242
were not.

00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:43.350
AUDIENCE: The ones with
particularly small sample

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.850
sizes.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.267
MICHAEL SHORT: That's what I
was hoping someone would say.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:47.830
Yeah, the case
study of four women

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.900
who got breast
cancer in the pocket

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.840
where they held their
cell phones, four, right?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
Or in a study of 29 humans, 11
of them got brain tumors here.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.080
It's pretty easy to cherry
pick small amounts of data.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.430
I did want to say that just
because radio frequency

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.720
photons aren't ionizing, doesn't
mean they can't hurt you.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.250
If you've ever-- no, no one's
ever been inside a microwave.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.170
I wonder if anyone's
ever felt the effects

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.990
of an external microwave
being by something like this,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.400
the active denial system.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.210
One of my favorite weapons ever,
because it doesn't actually

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.190
permanently hurt anyone.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.890
It just heats up the
outer layer of your skin.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.850
It fires these non-ionizing
photons at RF frequency

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.180
and effectively makes you
feel like you're on fire.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.610
So if there's a whole mess
of troops charging at you--

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.600
let's say at the DMZ from
North and South Korea--

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.910
all you've got to do
is turn on this thing,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.470
and they all think
they're on fire,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.380
because their body is sending
them signals that I'm on fire.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.390
And then you turn it
off, and they're OK.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.480
So no loss of life,
no permanent damage,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.730
a lot of maybe
psychological, but whatever,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.820
you can't see that.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.820
AUDIENCE: Active denial.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.580
MICHAEL SHORT: Active denial
system, great name for it,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.210
isn't it?

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.335
Yeah, I think non-lethal
weapons are really the way

00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.270
of the future is just make
it unpleasant to engage

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.790
in warfare, and
people probably won't.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.720
But then no one has to
get hurt, which is nice.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.600
But then onto the sources of
data, because like Sarah said,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.660
sample size is everything,
especially when you're

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.210
trying to figure out, are
small amounts of radiation

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.110
bad for you?

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.210
This simple question
hasn't really

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.960
been answered suitably yet,
and that's because, thank god,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.600
we don't have enough
people exposed

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.730
to small but measurable
amounts of radiation

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.300
to draw meaningful
conclusions from this data.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.810
I think that's a good thing,
is if we were certain about

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.730
whether small
amounts of radiation,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.795
like one millisieverts,
could cause cancer,

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:47.170
then there would have been
millions or billions of people

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.900
exposed, and so it's kind of a
good thing that they weren't.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.510
But the sources of this
data, the first source

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.522
was radium dial workers,
like you may have heard of,

00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:57.730
the folks that would lick
the paint brushes with glow

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.560
in the dark radium watches.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.090
They ended up setting the first
occupational limit for dose,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.950
because they were
the first large group

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.220
to be exposed to radiation
in a controlled setting.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.400
Things like uranium miners,
radon breathers, better known

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.880
as us, but especially
folks that smoke anything.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840
Medical diagnostics, so anyone
that gets a medical procedure,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.060
you can follow up with them
to find out what's, let's

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.820
say, the extra incidence
of cancer and figure

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.880
out, if you have a
high-dose medical procedure,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.520
does it induce secondary
cancer down the line?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.810
But like we said last time,
down the line is the key here.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.780
I'd take a whole
bunch of radiation

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.830
now, if it was going to
save my life now, and maybe

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.150
make it messed up in 20 years.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.100
Because then you get
20 more years of life

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.800
or however long you get.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.670
And then from
accidents, survivors

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.610
of the atomic bombs, not just
the folks at the epicenter,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
but in the whole fallout
regions and nearby, as well as

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.970
nearby nuclear accidents
and the criticality events

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.000
like the demon core that you
guys analyzed on the exam.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.340
Luckily, there aren't
a lot of those, either.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.260
But they were pretty severe,
the ones that got exposed.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And speaking of accidents,
has anyone ever heard

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.150
of the Kyshtym disaster?

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.430
This is the third-worst
nuclear accident

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.760
that we know of in history,
after Chernobyl and Fukushima,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.560
and worse than
Three Mile Island,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.620
because Three Mile Island
was an almost accident.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.050
There was some partial
melting of the core.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.630
There was almost no
release of radioactivity.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.420
And the definition of a nuclear
accident in the public sense

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.490
is release of radioactivity.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.040
There's actually two
quantities that folks

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.680
in PRA, or Probabilistic
Risk Analysis,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.790
are most interested in.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.630
Has anyone heard of these
terms, CDF and LERF?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.400
Core Damage Frequency and
Large Early Release Frequency.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.640
All the fancy probability
fault trees and everything

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.500
goes into calculating
the probability

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.300
that the core gets damaged.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.280
So that could be an
accident in one right.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.380
Or the probability of a
radioactivity release.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.163
And that is an accident.

00:06:56.163 --> 00:06:57.580
So if no one's
ever heard of this,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.920
there's a city in Russia--

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.990
I don't know why it says
Russland, maybe came

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.390
from a different language--

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.310
called Kyshtym, where
they had the Mayak

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.970
nuclear and reprocessing plant.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.010
And there was a tank
full of radioactive waste

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.450
that was exploded.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.140
It was a chemical explosion,
but full of strontium,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.210
all sorts of other
radionuclides that

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.270
blew up with about
100 tons worth of TNT,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.360
and ended up contaminating
a rather large area

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.700
with this plume called the--

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.600
I think it's called the East
Chelyabinsk Radioactive Trace--

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.370
or the--

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.870
what is it?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.380
The south-- South-something
Urals Radioactive Trace.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.960
And that area is still
contaminated today,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.260
because the disaster was
covered up, or rather wasn't--

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.430
nothing was said.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.290
These towns here, they didn't--

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.913
weren't actually towns back
in 1957 when this happened.

00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:49.330
They were just
given designations,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.660
like Chelyabinsk-40
or Chelyabinsk-65,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.110
because the largest nearby
city was Chelyabinsk,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.360
and the villages nearby
were just numbered.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.540
So that was just the post code
for the secret nuclear city.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.412
The US had a few, Russia
had something like 120.

00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:06.870
And they still have
a lot of cities

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.070
where entry is restricted, or
it's still awfully difficult

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.580
to go there.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.250
Like when you have to declare
where in Russia are you going

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.320
to get a visa, if you
say one of these cities,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.693
there's going to
be some questions.

00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:19.860
And this is where I'm going.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.175
AUDIENCE: To one
of those cities.

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:23.550
MICHAEL SHORT:
Best possible logo

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.080
for a conference being held
in Siberia in February.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.148
Right on the end--

00:08:29.148 --> 00:08:30.690
right on the edge
in this town called

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.780
Kyshtym, the nearest
town to the Mayak plant.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.220
So I'll be taking my camera.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.090
I don't know if I'll
be allowed to use it,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.971
but we're going to
find out anyway.

00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.304
It's being held in a sanatorium.

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:43.130
And does anyone know
what a sanatorium is?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.260
Like, I'm honestly
asking a question.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.940
I don't know what
a sanatorium is

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.370
or why the nuclear conference
is being held there.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.060
But it should be pretty cool.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.090
So yeah, Siberia in February,
right near the South Urals

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.520
Radioactive Trace,
should be interesting.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.960
Those of the first group
of folks that were exposed

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.010
were the people painting
radium watch dials.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.140
And the reason radium
was so damaging is

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.410
because radium is in the same
column of the periodic table

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.580
as calcium.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.290
It's a bone-seeking element.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.790
So which of the
tissues do you think

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.350
would be most damaged
by ingestion of radium?

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.240
AUDIENCE: The bones.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.290
MICHAEL SHORT: Bones-- what
part of the bone, specifically?

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.257
AUDIENCE: The marrow.

00:09:21.257 --> 00:09:22.340
MICHAEL SHORT: The marrow.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.440
The rapidly dividing
part of the bones.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.110
If you remember from the--

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.420
I don't have it on
this presentation,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.260
but the relative tissue
factors for different tissues,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.900
the hard part of
the bone is a 0.01.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.880
It's basically like
a nobody cares.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.680
Bone marrow, however,
is a different story,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.740
because it's always rapidly
dividing, producing red blood

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.490
cells, platelets, lymphocytes.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.460
It's making your blood, the
solid portion of your blood.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.160
And so it's a pretty
important tissue.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.440
So you get radium--

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.450
anyone also know, what
does radium tend to emit?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.262
Which kind of particles?

00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:03.190
AUDIENCE: Alphas.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.940
MICHAEL SHORT: If you have to
take a guess-- yeah, alphas.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.500
It's a pretty heavy element.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.880
It emits alphas.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.450
And alphas have that radiation
quality factor of 20,

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.620
meaning alphas have
very short range,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.710
but they're the most
damaging type of radiation

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.880
when ingested.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.210
So this was really bad news.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.870
There was a lot of incidents
of illness and cancer

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.330
from folks painting
radium watch dials.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.980
And then the first data
from bones after death,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.310
because there were a lot
of those, established,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.040
how much radium were you
allowed to get exposed to?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.580
And this came out to about
0.6 milligray per week.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.080
Anyone have any
idea what that would

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.060
be in millisieverts per week?

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.810
With a quality factor
of 20 and a bone marrow

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.888
factor of about 0.12?

00:10:46.888 --> 00:10:48.750
AUDIENCE: 1.73?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.680
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.740
On the order of like singles
of millisieverts per week.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.340
Not bad.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.965
Anyone know how much
dose you typically

00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:59.880
get in a year in background?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.380
Yeah?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.280
AUDIENCE: A few.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.030
MICHAEL SHORT: A few
millisieverts a year.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.810
Yeah.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.390
So this was the first
occupational safety

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.070
limit for radiation risk.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.130
It is-- actually, it comes out
to larger than 50 millisieverts

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.250
per year, which is what the
normal occupational workers are

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.090
allowed.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.900
How about you radiation workers?

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.910
What's your limit?

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.900
AUDIENCE: 5 rem.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.950
MICHAEL SHORT: 5 rem,
which comes out to?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.545
AUDIENCE: Like 50
millisieverts--

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.320
MICHAEL SHORT: 50
millisieverts per year.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.060
OK, there you go.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.633
Large population
sizes that do exist

00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:30.050
that get a whole
lot of radiation,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.500
however, is anyone that
smokes an anything,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.210
because when you take
plant matter, which

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.520
has a high surface
area, concentrate it,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.817
so anything that it brings up
from the roots in the soil,

00:11:40.817 --> 00:11:42.650
or that settles out on
the leaves in the air

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.050
gets concentrated
in the dry fraction,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.730
and then gets
burned and inhaled.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.630
A lot of those heavy metals that
are radon byproducts and such

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.100
are fairly reactive.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.990
They'll stick around
in your tissues

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.910
and give you a whole
lot of alpha dose.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.280
So when you have
populations of people

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.650
who have or haven't
smoked, you actually

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.830
can figure out the number
of extra attributable deaths

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.110
to things like indoor
radon, depending

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.150
on if you live in a
smoky atmosphere or not.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.640
And so to distinguish the
types of biological effects

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.970
that we're worried about,
we can group these into two.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.380
There's short-term effects,
which manifest themselves

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.270
in hours, days, or weeks.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.632
We'll call that immediate.

00:12:20.632 --> 00:12:22.090
And then there's
long-term effects,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.620
which tend to manifest in
shortest, years, and longest,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.410
decades.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.500
So things like acute
radiation sickness

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.550
is due to rapid cell death of a
few different kinds over time.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.410
And which kind depends
on the route of exposure,

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.620
the isotope, the
type of radiation,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.002
and the total amount of
dose to those tissues.

00:12:43.002 --> 00:12:44.460
And if you guys
have all-- what are

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.750
some of the symptoms of
acute radiation sickness?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.750
Like, did anyone read
what happened to the folks

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.832
in the demon core?

00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:52.290
AUDIENCE: That
their hair fell out.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.498
MICHAEL SHORT: Hair fell out.

00:12:53.498 --> 00:12:54.420
What else?

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.740
AUDIENCE: They vomit.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.038
MICHAEL SHORT: Vomiting.

00:12:57.038 --> 00:12:57.830
AUDIENCE: Diarrhea.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Diarrhea.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.320
All the fun ones, yeah.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.210
Well, we'll explain why
these sorts of things

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.830
happen with acute
radiation exposure.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.850
Now if you don't get that
much radiation exposure,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.410
but you do get enough
to mutate cells

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.260
you have what's called
delayed somatic effects,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.820
anything from cancer,
to straight up

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.770
mutations, to birth defects.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.040
Any sort of permanent and
reproducible modification

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.480
to a cell's DNA that
can induce mutations.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.480
So let's first talk about
the short-term effects

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.760
because they're a little
easier to understand.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.940
And because the doses were much
higher, you don't need as much

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.870
of a population size in order
to figure out, did this affect--

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.130
did this amount of
dose have an effect?

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.790
So for things up to
a quarter of a gray,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.960
pretty much nothing happens.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.180
That's quite a toasty dose.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.090
For gammas, that would be
like getting five times

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.990
your occupational yearly
limit instantaneously.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.490
Yeah.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.440
This is not something
you'd want to happen.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.680
But it's not going to cause
any significant ill effects.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.010
Up to a gray, you'll start
to see a few symptoms,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.540
like nausea and anorexia.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.180
They probably tend
to go together.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.790
If you're feeling
gastrointestinally horrible,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.830
you probably don't
want to eat much.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.260
And you will see things
like bone marrow damage,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.730
like we talked about
with the radium workers.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.150
Fewer red and white blood
cells, less platelets,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.400
also means easier to bleed.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.350
So a lot of the effects
of radiation damage

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.380
are not primary,
they're secondary.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.540
Just like most radiation
damage to cells

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.950
itself is not damage
to the DNA, but it's

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.410
radiolysis of the water nearby
the DNA, and eventual chemical

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.600
migration to cause damage
to the DNA chemically.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.090
In this case, it's not
like radiation takes out

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.500
your platelets.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.690
Radiation takes out
the cells that create

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.580
the platelets, the bone marrow.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.070
Meaning that platelets, if
they live about three weeks,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.870
you'll tend to see a
drop in platelet count

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.930
when your production
system gets lower.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.160
This should sound strikingly
similar to series radioactive

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.580
decay because the same equations
can be used to model it.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.937
Let's say you have a normal,
stable platelet count.

00:15:02.937 --> 00:15:04.520
Eh, I'm not going
to get on the board.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.960
I told you guys we wouldn't
get to derivey anymore.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.780
But you've got some
source of platelets, which

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.947
would be your bone marrow.

00:15:10.947 --> 00:15:12.780
And you've got some
sink of platelets, which

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.050
would be normal cell death.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.670
So let's say there's a half-life
or a lifetime of platelets.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.380
If you kill a little
bit of the source,

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.427
then you'll see the
sink start to decay.

00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:23.010
But the source will
start to grow back

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.810
over time from cell division.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.260
And you'll see the
level pop back up again.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.850
And you can model it
with the same first-order

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.460
linear ordinary
differential equations.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.198
Same ODEs as series
radioactive decay,

00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:36.990
you can use to guess
how many platelets you

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.340
should have in your body at any
time following a certain dose.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.340
1 to 3 grays is when
things get bad from-- go

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.350
to bed from worse pretty quick.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.770
Nausea, anorexia,
and infection--

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.740
tell me, why do you
think infection results

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.460
from radiation damage?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:56.960
Yeah.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.212
Let's hear everything, yeah.

00:15:58.212 --> 00:15:59.420
Front to back, let's hear it.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.890
AUDIENCE: I was saying
the immune system

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.250
is most likely compromised
because of bone marrow being

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:03.808
compromised.

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:04.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.230
The immune system's compromised.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.220
What else?

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:07.970
AUDIENCE: You're--

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:10.710
MICHAEL SHORT: Is everyone
going to say the same thing?

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.210
OK.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.660
I have another story.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.090
So I agree with you guys.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:18.510
But it also has to do
with these platelets.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.170
Anytime anything happens to
you ever, cells tend to die.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.618
You clap your hands, you
probably kill a few cells.

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:26.910
You bump into something, you
probably kill a few cells.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.980
You swallow some
metal shavings, you're

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.750
going to kill a lot of cells.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.820
But your body has
got mucous membranes,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.640
and all sorts of things,
and platelets in order

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.920
to repair that damage.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.010
All of a sudden, if your
blood thins out, and can

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.600
start leaking from
different places,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.060
or it's a lot harder to
repair like physical leaks

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.025
in your body,
bacteria can get in.

00:16:48.025 --> 00:16:49.650
So the normal amount
of bacteria you're

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.235
exposed to every day,
which is enormous--

00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:53.610
there's theorized
to be something

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.470
like 10 times as
many bacteria cells

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.730
in your body as human cells.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.370
They're all over the place.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.003
They're just a lot smaller.

00:17:01.003 --> 00:17:03.420
Well, they can get into places
that they wouldn't normally

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:03.930
get in.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.359
So what would
normally be a pinprick

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.510
in a simple immune response,
with a suppressed immune system

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.910
and a lower platelet count,
becomes a much more dangerous

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.510
thing.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.940
You could undergo
something called sepsis.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.339
That's basically blood
turning to sewage because you

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.410
get a massive blood infection.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.170
This is, again let's say, a
secondary or even a tertiary

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.060
effect, but very real.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.234
Hematologic damage more severe--

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:29.680
hema refers to blood.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.660
That's basically
saying the same thing.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.480
Recovery probable,
though not assured.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.402
Why probable, and
why not assured?

00:17:38.402 --> 00:17:40.265
AUDIENCE: Everybody
reacts differently.

00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:41.390
MICHAEL SHORT: That's true.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.950
Everyone reacts differently.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.320
It also matters how
much treatment you get.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.020
So if you get a crazy
compromised immune system,

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.690
we have hospitals,
and sterile bubbles,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.800
and all sorts of things
that you can be put in.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.670
But if you don't get
to a hospital in time

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.910
to reduce the onset
of massive infection,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.770
that's what could happen.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.070
Then you go higher 3
to 6 gray, everything

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:08.180
as above, plus diarrhea,
depilation, hair loss,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.530
temporary sterility.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.740
Think the temporary
sterility one's obvious.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.320
Why do you think diarrhea
and hair loss would occur?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.420
AUDIENCE: Isn't it like
the fact that your--

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.760
the cells of your
like intestines--

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.410
then you can't like hold it
in anymore because the damage.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.020
Exactly.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.030
The most sensitive
cells are the ones

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.300
that are rapidly dividing
to make villi and stem cells

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.500
in your intestines.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.190
Hair follicles, gonads, anything
that's dividing all the time,

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.860
is going to feel the
effects of radiation damage

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.240
much more severely.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.460
And barring any mutation,
which may take a long time

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.310
to manifest, the wrong
damage to DNA, and the cell

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.420
just can't divide.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.860
So it dies.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.050
And if those cells
die, then that

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.150
means that you can't
uptake nutrition.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.990
And your body just flushes
everything out in diarrhea.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.330
Fatalities will occur in
the range of 3 and 1/2

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.370
gray without treatment.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.650
And this is what's
called the typical LD50.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.648
Does anyone know
what an LD50 is?

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.652
AUDIENCE: The lethal dose.

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.110
MICHAEL SHORT: The
lethal dose for?

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.460
AUDIENCE: 50% of the population.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.335
MICHAEL SHORT: Right.

00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:20.010
So about 50% of the people
exposed to 3.5 gray will die.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.630
This doesn't take into account
difference in treatment,

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.947
difference in person, or
everything, it's altogether.

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:27.030
And I'll go into what an
LD50 for different things

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.140
is in a second.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.940
And then over 6 gray, you
get immediate incapacitation.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.960
Hits the nervous system.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.790
You get so many
cells leaking out

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.670
that the chemical signals
for your neurons, sodium,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.960
and potassium, and other ions.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.982
Well, if all your
cells die and leak out,

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:43.440
then all of a sudden
you're flooded

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.020
with the ions that are
normally kept in a very

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.510
careful equilibrium to signal.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.670
So you can actually get
sudden unconsciousness

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.890
in a matter of seconds to
minutes from doses over 10

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.000
gray.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.860
So you just-- you just
go out like a light,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.720
like that, and may not recover.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.340
What's an LD50?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.210
It's the-- it's whenever
an effect gets an onset

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.770
by 50% of the population.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.680
And there are different
something-something 50 doses,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.920
depending on, let's say, whether
something's therapeutic, toxic,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.970
or lethal.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.231
The example I like
to give is selenium.

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:20.080
Does anyone know anything
about selenium in the diet?

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.440
It's one of those trace minerals
that you need to survive,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.648
but can also kill you.

00:20:25.648 --> 00:20:27.190
If you need to get,
about on average,

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.620
5 micrograms of
selenium in order

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.570
to produce certain enzymes that
keep things going in the body.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.540
5 micrograms is not a lot.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.510
But you know that in order to
have a little bit of selenium,

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.280
it's got a therapeutic effect.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.840
Once you get around
5 micrograms,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.425
most people will see some
sort of biological benefit.

00:20:44.425 --> 00:20:48.390
If you get 5 milligrams,
starts to become toxic.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.650
And this is the case with
pretty much anything.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.520
Vitamins-- anyone ever had--

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.200
this is probably
going to be a no--

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.590
anyone ever eaten raw
seal liver before?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.910
Or polar bear livers?

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.680
I don't know.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.450
No one's gone up,
way, way up north?

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.510
AUDIENCE: Vitamin C.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Anyone--
do you know why?

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.382
Or--

00:21:04.382 --> 00:21:06.110
AUDIENCE: Because they
have too much vitamin A--

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.027
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:21:07.027 --> 00:21:10.150
Vitamin A, something that you
need a whole lot to survive.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.310
It's so concentrated
in the livers the seals

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.978
and polar bears that if you were
to just eat a polar bear liver,

00:21:14.978 --> 00:21:16.520
you would die of
vitamin A poisoning.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.823
AUDIENCE: --you'd be dead.

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:21.198
MICHAEL SHORT: So I didn't
hear all those things at once.

00:21:21.198 --> 00:21:22.010
One of the time.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.460
AUDIENCE: If anyone ever offers
you that, you just say no.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.460
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
take a little taste.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.480
You know, it's all
about the amount, right?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.572
What were you guys saying?

00:21:29.572 --> 00:21:31.739
AUDIENCE: If we had eaten
it, wouldn't we have died?

00:21:31.739 --> 00:21:32.739
MICHAEL SHORT: Well, no.

00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:34.560
It's not like you take
a taste and you die.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.880
Again, it's all about
the amount of exposure.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.580
One little taste is not going to
flood your system with vitamin

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.498
A. But you eat an entire
polar bears liver,

00:21:41.498 --> 00:21:42.790
you're going to have a bad day.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.140
AUDIENCE: Why does it
have so much vitamin A?

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Wait, what?

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.245
AUDIENCE: Why does it
have so much vitamin A?

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:49.578
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't know
why polar bears have so much

00:21:49.578 --> 00:21:53.150
vitamin A. No idea, actually.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.640
But then beyond that, you
can get lethal effects,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.220
where you might get sick from
eating too much of something.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.475
But then again, you know--

00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:01.850
anyone ever heard
of the old hold

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.050
your wee for a Wii contest?

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.300
Where we found out
really the LD50 of water?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:08.800
Yeah.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.130
So you drink way too much water
without any other solutes,

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.680
you deplete your body
from electrolytes.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.170
And then you can also die.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.750
So I ran into this
experience personally.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.250
I don't have to ask
any of you guys.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.290
I went hiking with
my dad in Nepal,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.910
in 2009, and the last
vacation I've taken--

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.280
that's a long time ago.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.030
It's kind of cool.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.488
At MIT, it's fun
enough here that I

00:22:29.488 --> 00:22:31.960
haven't felt like I've
needed a vacation in, what,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.800
like seven years?

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.530
I'm actually kind of
taking one this year

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.030
because I'm going
somewhere for research

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.080
and just sticking around.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.820
But we went hiking in Nepal
I eat something I probably

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.320
shouldn't.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.653
In fact, everyone eventually
ate something they probably

00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:44.500
shouldn't.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.050
And I had what
could be described

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.610
as massive GI syndrome--

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.820
Delhi belly, whatever
you wanted to call it.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.400
My brother likes to call
it poop and mouth disease,

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.580
because sanitation and
stuff is not the best there.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.790
And so I was in a
pretty bad state.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.490
And instead of drinking water
to replenish all of the water

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.460
that was leaving out of every
direction from the body,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.750
drinking saltwater.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.110
We took tablets that had the
same isotonic concentration

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.460
of electrolytes, amino acids,
as those being lost by the body,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.110
because when water
goes in the body,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.300
everything osmotically
equilibrates.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.335
If you take in
lots of pure water,

00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:23.710
it will-- a little
bit of sodium,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.040
potassium, other electrolytes
will dissolve into that water.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.650
If it's going out
in any direction,

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.450
it's going to leave your body,
depleting you of electrolytes.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.600
So I had seven wonderful
days lying in bed,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.900
drinking about a liter of warm
salt water every 15 minutes

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.930
or so in order to maintain
not just the water,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.990
but the electrolytes
that your body needed.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.548
Freaky, huh?

00:23:45.548 --> 00:23:47.090
AUDIENCE: Sounds
like a fun vacation.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.965
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, it
was a great vacation.

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:51.420
Is there any wonder why I
don't want to take another one?

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.700
If I go back there, I'm
having nothing but Clif bars.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.200
It's hard to say no when folks
that live up in the mountains

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.742
offer you what little
food they have,

00:23:58.742 --> 00:24:02.010
but you should really say
no for your own safety.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.150
Anyway, yeah, there's
an LD50 for water--

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.120
by any mechanism, from
electrolyte depletion

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.430
to-- there was a
contest on the radio

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.750
called hold your wee for a Wii.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.500
When the Nintendo Wii
came out, they said,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.760
how much water could you drink
without going to the bathroom?

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.656
And someone's bladder exploded.

00:24:18.656 --> 00:24:20.600
AUDIENCE: Like
literally exploded?

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:20.730
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.597
That's what I heard.

00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:23.180
Either it would be
a bladder explosion

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.570
or an electrolyte depletion.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.900
So whatever the
mechanism, the LD50

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.015
just tells if somebody--
if a population ingests

00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:31.640
a certain amount of
something, or takes

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.710
in a certain amount
of radiation,

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.140
how much will cause 50% to die.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.380
Or for much lower
doses, 50% will

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.980
see some therapeutic
effect by any mechanism.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.190
It doesn't distinguish
by mechanism.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.860
So the four phases of
radiation damage, this

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.990
is where all those Latin and
bio roots really come in handy.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.230
The prodromal phase is
the initial symptoms

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:58.000
of exposure, which may or may
not happen one to three days

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.410
after exposure.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.588
For massive exposure,
you're not going

00:25:01.588 --> 00:25:03.130
to see this, because
you're not going

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.020
to live one to three days.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.420
For very minor exposure,
you may not even

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.880
see these prodromal effects,
like a drop in blood cell

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.550
count, or GI syndrome,
because the dose might not

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.300
be severe enough for your body
not to be able to cope with it.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.190
The latent phase this,
is the tricky one.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.790
An apparent recovery from
the prodromal systems.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.950
So getting a medium dose
of radiation-- let's call,

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.720
that like 2 to 5 gray--

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.320
will cause some nausea,
vomiting, and headache.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.150
And then you get better.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.390
And then you get worse in
the manifest illness phase,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.730
because a lot of the things
that radiation will do

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.410
can be immediate.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.520
If you suddenly cause the
body to release serotonin

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.770
and induce the
vomiting reflex, that

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.455
goes away once that serotonin
is consumed or dealt with.

00:25:50.455 --> 00:25:52.330
I don't know how the
body would deal with it.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.430
And you might think
you're getting better.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.960
But the cells that
divide rapidly

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.790
have still incurred that damage.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.400
And you won't see that damage
until they fail to divide

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.510
in their normal amount of time.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.350
So things like GI
syndrome and hair loss

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.750
might not show up for
a few days afterwards,

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.720
because it's not like your hair
will just instantly fall out,

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.570
like there's some cell that is
holding onto your hair follicle

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.950
and then will just release
it when irradiated.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.980
But those follicles
won't continue

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.260
to produce the keratin
at the same rate,

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.140
or in a different way, or I
can't speak that intelligently

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.440
about exactly the
mechanism of hair loss,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.900
but it will take a little
bit of time to get there.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.470
And the final phase is a binary.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.860
Do you recover or do you die?

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.420
Could take days, to months,
to years to figure that out.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.820
And these weren't
in the reading,

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.640
but I wanted to pull some
much better tables about what

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.270
happens in each of these phases
as a function of radiation

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.200
dose.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.750
So when does vomiting onset?

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.200
There are actually
patterns to be seen here.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.270
So for mild, it may take a
couple of hours after exposure.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.670
You may not stimulate
the immediate release

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.560
of the hormones that
induce vomiting.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.570
But then as the dose gets
more and more severe,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.690
could be anywhere from hours
to less than 10 minutes.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.550
So you can use the onset of
things like vomiting, diarrhea,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.230
headache, loss of
consciousness in severe cases,

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.970
to gauge the amount
of dose someone

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.340
has absorbed in some
unknown accident.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.590
Because it's not like if
you're in some severe nuclear

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.990
accident, and you don't
happened to be wearing

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.570
a very large range
dosimeter, how do you

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.950
know how much dose you've got?

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.070
And how do you know how
to treat the person?

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.410
Time can be your
best weapon there,

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.860
because except for
very lethal doses,

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.620
where you could go unconscious
in seconds or minutes,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.900
you've got some
time-- hours to days--

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.640
to treat what happened.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.220
And if you can say, all right,
I know the time of exposure,

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.770
and I know the time
of onset of headache,

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.010
of diarrhea, of vomiting,
you can figure out, roughly

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.160
maybe within plus or minus a
gray, how much dose you had

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.303
and what to treat.

00:27:53.303 --> 00:27:55.220
There are probably smarter
ways of doing this,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.160
but with nothing else,
you've got time as a variable

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.720
to help you figure this out.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.460
Why do you guys think that your
body temperature would go up

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.780
upon exposure to huge
amounts of radiation?

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.400
What's with the fever?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.545
What is the fever a response to?

00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:14.787
Or could it be a response to?

00:28:14.787 --> 00:28:15.620
AUDIENCE: Infection.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.980
MICHAEL SHORT: Infection.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.070
So any sort of sudden
massive infection

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.140
would mount an immune response.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.030
And that would cause
a fever because you've

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.820
got all sorts of cells
doing things, expending

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.730
energy, trying to rid your
body of the infection.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.300
What else?

00:28:34.723 --> 00:28:37.960
That's OK, something for you
to read up on for the-- not

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.470
for the--

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.780
for the practice homework.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.530
The one that I can't
make due because it's

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.960
after the last day of classes.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.460
What about-- let's see--

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.220
headache, I don't think
we've explained that well.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.560
We'll get into the
diarrhea stuff.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.020
Let's go into the latent phase.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.470
What tends to happen?

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.860
Well, looks like you get
better, but blood work

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.590
will tell you otherwise.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.250
And you can then
tell how much dose

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.070
you were exposed to after
a certain amount of time

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.010
by things like lymphocyte
and granulocyte count,

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.740
different immune system
blood cells, also platelets,

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.450
also all sorts of other things.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.960
You can tell by a drop in
certain blood cell levels

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.830
how much dose you've had.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.950
And you can sustain
a certain drop

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.860
in platelets and immune cells
without any ill effects.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.070
Something like 30% to 40% of
your platelets could go away,

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.780
you're not a
hemophiliac, temporarily.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.130
You're still going to be OK.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.470
You can form blood
clots in result--

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.940
what is it-- response to
a nosebleed or a bruise,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.420
and these things aren't
going to be life-threatening.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.500
Diarrhea, for low doses,
you don't really get any.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.320
So it looks like intestinal
cells may be a little bit more

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.720
robust than bone marrow.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.570
Except with really
severe doses, you'll

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.660
start to see that pop up once
those cells fail to divide.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.890
Once, let's say, the
existing villi die off,

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.170
new ones don't replace them,
and you lose your ability

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.080
to uptake nutrition.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.640
And then depilation, hair loss.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.015
Beginning on day
15 or later, you

00:30:03.015 --> 00:30:04.515
might think you're
out of the woods,

00:30:04.515 --> 00:30:06.823
and then all of a sudden,
your hair starts to fall out.

00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:08.990
And that'll help tell you
about how much dose you've

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.430
had once again.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.930
And then the
critical phase, what

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.500
happens when things go from
bad, to better, to worse?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.520
How quickly does this happen?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.060
You tend to get things
like infections,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.470
more severe infections,
disorientation.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.892
On longer times, like seven
days, your platelet count--

00:30:28.892 --> 00:30:31.690
it's pretty
proportional to dose.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.260
Same thing with the number of
lymphocytes, lower, and lower,

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.190
and lower.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.643
And then the onset time
is smaller and smaller.

00:30:38.643 --> 00:30:40.060
And then you can
see the lethality

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.518
of these different
doses, depending

00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:44.440
on the person, the treatments,
the susceptibility,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.940
any sort of
pre-existing conditions,

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.982
which you might not know.

00:30:46.982 --> 00:30:47.950
Do you have a question?

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.575
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:48.575 --> 00:30:51.678
I was going to ask,
for cancer patients,

00:30:51.678 --> 00:30:53.470
when you hear about
them losing their hair,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.853
are they actually getting doses
in like the 2 to 4 gray range?

00:30:57.853 --> 00:30:59.020
MICHAEL SHORT: Cancer, yeah.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.730
AUDIENCE: Because
it's so concentrated.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Radiation
doses are pretty intense.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.343
So the dose to the
tumor, for example,

00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:07.510
in proton therapy, which
is the only one I've really

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.880
read about, can be in
the kilogray level.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.420
But the idea there is you fry
the tumor, you kill it soon.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.420
Like you go beyond the
lethal dose for those

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.900
cells, while inducing
much less damage

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.168
in the rest of the
surrounding person.

00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:23.710
And that's the nice
quirk of protons,

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.480
is you can do that in
a very narrow range.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.320
The straggle on 250
MeV proton beams

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.370
is on the order of like,
microns, less than millimeters,

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.960
which is pretty cool.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.680
But a lot of the hair loss can
come from the chemotherapy.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.610
Chemotherapy is better
known as poison.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.138
It's just a poison that affects
tumor cells slightly more

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:47.680
strongly than the
rest of your cells.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.570
But it is nasty stuff.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.250
And it's the chemo that can
cause the hair loss as well.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.010
Yeah.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.950
So would you attribute the hair
loss to radiation or to chemo?

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.290
I would say chances are
it's chemo, depending

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.340
on where the tumor is.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.860
I mean, if you have a
localized proton beam coming in

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.020
to treat a tumor
there or there, you're

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.650
not going to get much
hair loss up here.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.560
But chemo penetrates
throughout the whole body.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.050
As far as if you're getting
X-ray therapy of a brain tumor,

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.910
that I don't know.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.590
I really haven't
looked into that.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.730
So good question.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.770
And then the time and
severity of these symptoms.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.440
Well, this is something I'd like
you guys to read on your own,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.065
because it's tons of
words on a screen.

00:32:28.065 --> 00:32:30.190
But it's something
I suggest you read.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.390
It's not done that
carefully in the reading,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.490
which is why I provided it
here for you in the slides.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.510
And then going on to what
these radiation symptoms mean,

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.030
I wanted to translate a
little bit of the Latin,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.670
Greek, whatever, roots into
something you can understand.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.840
These hematopoietic symptoms--
anything to do with the blood,

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.210
decreased platelets,
immune suppression,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.180
all that kind of stuff.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.410
And the origin is the stem
cell system in your bone marrow

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.390
breaks down and you
don't make as much

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.600
of all the components of
blood as you normally should.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.300
The gastrointestinal
comes from the stem cells

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.070
in the villi, those
high surface area

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.170
structures in your
intestines that

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.170
absorb the nutrition, which
are also normally covered

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.240
in a thick layer of
mucus to keep all

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.980
the bacteria from getting out.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.780
Because nutrients,
like, let's say,

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.900
minerals or small proteins,
are a hell of a lot

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.560
smaller than bacteria, they
can diffuse or transport

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.930
through the mucus much faster.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.970
So you can uptake the nutrition
and not let the bad stuff in.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.150
And the neuro or
cerebrovascular stuff

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.220
is straight up blasting
of endothelial cells.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.400
Your, let's say-- yeah--

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.080
I think that's skin cells.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.080
A term called edema,
which is fluid leakage.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.200
Has anyone ever seen pictures
of folks with massive edema

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:44.740
in the legs?

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.698
Like, folks that, let's
say, haven't gotten out

00:33:46.698 --> 00:33:49.810
of bed for years and their
legs swell up like this?

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.240
That's just fluid leaking
into the intracellular spaces.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.113
I'd say take a look.

00:33:53.113 --> 00:33:55.030
I don't think I'm going
to show pictures of it

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.870
because it's kind of
nasty on the screen.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.240
But if you want to know
what edema looks like,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.490
then I suggest you look it up.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:05.100
There's plenty of horrific
stuff on Google Images.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.969
And so what happens in
these hematopoietic cells?

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:12.630
About 1 gray can knock
out about a third

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:16.290
of your bone marrow cells,
and that's actually OK,

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.159
because those surviving cells
are redividing quite quickly.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.409
And that means that you won't
have that much of a drop

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.929
in blood cells, because let's
say you kill off a bunch

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:28.183
of the bone marrow cells ,
but they redivide in a shorter

00:34:28.183 --> 00:34:30.600
lifetime than, let's say, the
red blood cells or platelets

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.320
live.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.770
You're not going to see that
much of a dip in the blood cell

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.440
levels, which are ultimately
your main line of defense

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.530
against sepsis.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.380
Things like destruction of
bone marrow, yeah that would--

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.713
that would be a bad thing.

00:34:44.713 --> 00:34:46.130
There's a whole
lot of words here.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.755
I'd say this is better
for you to read.

00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:50.510
I want to go through an
explanation of some pictures

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.969
of what tends to happen
to, in this case,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:57.230
mouse bone marrow tissue
after a lethal dose, 9.5 gray.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.630
That's what it looks
like beforehand.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.390
That's what you're left with,
is very, very few cells.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.540
So that would be definitely
what a lethal dose looks like,

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.480
because the ability to make
all the things that bone

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.450
marrow makes has been almost
eliminated in this tissue.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.430
So a visual of what these
sorts of things look like.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.700
For the gastrointestinal
systems--

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.990
I'm going to skip right
ahead and show you

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.202
what healthy and irradiated
villi tend to look like.

00:35:25.202 --> 00:35:26.660
So I've been-- does
anyone not know

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.680
what I mean when I say villi?

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.280
OK, good.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.740
So the little high
surface area structures

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.810
in your intestine
that are normally

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.420
great absorbers of nutrition,
mostly due to their surface

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.700
area, but also due
to their structure

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.580
and their biological function.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.650
And you tend to kill those off
with a fair bit of radiation.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.580
So this is what it looks like
after four days, and seven

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.680
days, and then 12 days.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.115
Things can recover.

00:35:52.115 --> 00:35:54.490
As long as you don't kill all
the cells, they will divide

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.960
and they will reconquer.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.850
And if the organism
can live long enough

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.790
to allow for that natural
healing to take place,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.700
then you can survive an
acute dose of radiation.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.160
So when we talk about why do
you need hospital treatment,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.300
it's basically to stand in for
your body's normal functions

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.850
while your body regenerates
those functions.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:17.432
But for extremely severe cases--
let's go back to that table

00:36:17.432 --> 00:36:18.890
of how many, let's
say, leukocytes,

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.080
or what not you have--
or lymphocytes--

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.520
if you get down
to the zero level,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.920
you've completely knocked
out your body's ability

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.240
to produce those.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.490
You might have a few
cells left here or there.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.800
But at that point, there's
not much anyone can do

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.592
but make you comfortable.

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.800
And then in this case, I
think this was a human one--

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.270
yeah, OK.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.250
So a healthy intestine
from a human.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:45.080
It's got a rather small whatever
that part is in the submucosa

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.800
level.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.500
Lots of villi, lots
of surface area.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.080
After radiation damage, when
you have massive cell death,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.060
notice that the structures
out here are pretty much gone.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.930
And there's a lot of
scarring or-- what's

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.240
the word that they use?

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.250
Severe fibrosis.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.500
Why would your body make
scar tissue in response

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.640
to radiation damage?

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.490
So anytime your body senses that
a whole lot of cells are dying,

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.412
it's going to respond
by attempting to repair.

00:37:17.412 --> 00:37:19.870
So like if you get, let's say,
a small bit of surgery done,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.537
you could be left
with some scar tissue.

00:37:21.537 --> 00:37:24.520
That's cells that have died,
and when those cell contents

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.340
leak out, they signal to the
nearby cells, fix something.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.340
I can't speak any more
intelligently about that,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.750
but the body does.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.170
And scar tissue is not what
you want in your intestines

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.460
because that interferes with--

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:37.960
what is it?

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.700
Nutrition uptake
as well as killing

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.950
the structures that are doing
that uptake to begin with.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.560
Then there's the
neurovascular stuff.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.650
Massive cell death from a
huge amount of absorbed energy

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.190
can just cause those
cells to die and leak out,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.750
causing a lot of edema.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.990
That can cause a drop in blood
pressure, which is also not

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.773
good for you.

00:37:57.773 --> 00:38:00.440
This could be part of what leads
to some of the unconsciousness.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.260
If you have a drop in blood
pressure due to any reason,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.630
then that can make
you go unconscious.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:09.380
And there's pretty much not a
prodromal or a latent phase.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.293
If you hit the
neurovascular syndrome,

00:38:11.293 --> 00:38:13.460
you're pretty much going
to go to the critical phase

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.020
right away, within
seconds, minutes,

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.266
or small number of hours.

00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:22.600
Here's another question,
why the skin lesions?

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.100
Because mature skin cells
live about three weeks.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.010
If you kill off the skin
cells in the dividing layer,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.040
and you don't reform new ones,
and those skin cells die,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.950
you end up with the
grossest word in this class,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.490
moist desquamation.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.140
It kind of sounds
like what it is.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.570
That's like
sloughing off of skin

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.120
and leaving open
sores because you

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.450
don't have the ability to
regenerate that skin, which

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.240
is normally your first line
of defense to everything,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.650
and you've got
fluid leaking out.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:55.850
And it's just-- yeah--
it's moist desquamation.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:56.840
Why the vomiting?

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.207
Well, this question hasn't
been fully answered yet.

00:39:00.207 --> 00:39:02.540
As far as back when I've
looked at the literature around

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.740
to 2011, there is a hypothesis
that intestinal cells

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.790
will secrete serotonin in
certain conditions, including

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.280
when they start dying,
which would then stimulate

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.000
a center in your medulla, the
sort of automatic reflex center

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.910
of the brain, to
induce vomiting.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.600
Why might this be a good thing?

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.120
We're not talking about
radiation, but why would

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.912
you want to stimulate
this vomiting reflex?

00:39:27.111 --> 00:39:28.778
AUDIENCE: In case
whatever's going wrong

00:39:28.778 --> 00:39:30.200
is because of something you ate.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.033
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:39:31.033 --> 00:39:34.360
So let's say you eat
a wet aged steak.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.327
You know, something that's
left out on the table,

00:39:37.327 --> 00:39:39.410
or in the fridge, or let's
say, behind the fridge,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.820
or left to marinate in the sun.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.830
And you eat it,
and those bacteria

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.570
start killing everything.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.250
If those cells in
your intestine die,

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.230
they've got to send
some signal far away

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:53.400
to the brain to tell you to get
everything out of the stomach.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.600
And that's what happens.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.080
So the body has developed
these long distance hormonal

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.690
signaling mechanisms
to say, something

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.330
is going wrong,
expel everything,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:05.250
because it's
probably bad for you.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.740
So radiation damage to these
cells, which will kill them,

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.900
may trigger the same effects.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.690
If those cells have little
pockets or organelles that

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.750
contain these hormones
and cause instantaneous

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.350
secretion by cell death, that
might do the same thing, too.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.410
But as far as this
paper, it's a hypothesis.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:25.020
It's not necessarily proven.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.350
But it does correlate inversely
with the amount of time

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.900
to vomiting, in terms of
dose and time to vomiting.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.400
So that much we do know.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.067
And then onto the
long-term effects.

00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.650
There's two that are
really important,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.470
is cancer risk and
birth defect risk.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.490
You won't tend to see this
happen, despite popular media.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.580
But you will see a lot
of bad stuff happen.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.390
These are extremely difficult
to wrap our heads around.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.960
And the reason for that is
the population size required

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.530
in order to do a proper
study with proper statistics,

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.770
and give confidence to
the saying, let's say,

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.200
a dose-- in order to,
let's say, a dose of 1

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.170
milligray would have some
amount of excess risk,

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:11.540
you'd need to expose
61.8 million people,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.720
plus a similarly sized control
to distinguish whether or not

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.447
0.1 milligray has an
additional amount of risk.

00:41:19.447 --> 00:41:21.030
So let's say for
gammas to whole body,

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.850
what's 0.1 milligray in
terms of increased risk

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:24.960
dose in sieverts--

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.905
sorry-- 1 milligray?

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.740
1 millisievert.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.220
Tissue factor is 1, gamma
radiation quality factor

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.590
is 1, that's 1 millisievert.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.190
That's 20 years of exposure--
or 20 years of allowed exposure

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.570
at the same time.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.940
Or 10 years of exposure
at the same time,

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.620
where 100 microsievert exposure
at once has been said to say,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.730
maybe that's the onset of
detectable amount of damage.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:00.290
Pretty difficult, and our
sources of data for these doses

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.900
are a lot smaller--

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.300
with the exception of
very high irradiations

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.400
than we need to make
any real conclusions.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.700
The largest sample size
we have besides smokers

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.650
would be atomic bomb survivors.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.930
So folks have followed all of
the survivors of the Hiroshima

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.160
and Nagasaki bombings.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.820
Not just the people nearby, but
in the surrounding countryside.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.850
And tried to follow, how many
excess cancers were there

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.830
as a result of the radiation?

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.920
For anyone exposed within 3
kilometers for less than 5

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.000
milligray, you can attribute,
basically, either one or none.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.830
So by following
this group of people

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.650
and finding out how many of them
got cancer compared to control

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.140
groups, you can
try and figure out,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.030
how much extra cancer
was due to radiation?

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.040
And to graph this-- this
is actually in the--

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.830
I think the ICRP
publication, graphing

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.810
the amount of relative
risk, or to use

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.780
the words from the last studies
we saw, the Odds Ratio--

00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.650
the OR-- of getting
cancer, an odds ratio of 1

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.560
means exactly the same
amount of risk with

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.390
versus without the radiation.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:08.628
And the actual raw data
points are plotted here.

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:10.670
And there's a couple of
lines drawn through here.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.753
And this is the source of
a lot of the controversy

00:43:12.753 --> 00:43:15.320
behind radiation
damaged nowadays.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.060
The black line is the LNT, or
the Linear No-Threshold model,

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.420
which is a hypothesis that
says every amount of radiation

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.380
is bad, and it is
linear with dose.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.210
I, for one, don't
believe this model.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.090
This is, to me, a
fear-based model.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.430
It's certainly easy to
make policy based on this,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.880
because you can--

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.667
I think your average congressman
can understand a linear graph.

00:43:38.667 --> 00:43:40.250
Not sure whether
they could understand

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.410
p-values and statistics.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.500
But they're-- they
don't have to.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.600
It's what they ask
scientists to testify about.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.820
When you look at
the actual data,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.860
there's this kind
of funky shaped line

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.260
along with plus or minus
1 sigma error bars.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.580
It doesn't really show a
linear threshold, does it?

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.250
It actually looks like
it might be super linear

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.307
for very small doses.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.390
And then it tails off, and
then it picks up again.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.678
But this right here is a
zoom-in of this data rich area

00:44:09.678 --> 00:44:10.220
of the graph.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.573
It actually looks like
for really high doses,

00:44:12.573 --> 00:44:14.240
it might be a little
super linear again,

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.220
where things get
much, much worse.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.920
Hopefully you don't have
anyone exposed to, let's say,

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.550
2 gray of dose, but the
real controversy is here,

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.650
in the small dose region.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.820
We don't really know enough to
say whether very small doses

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.140
are hurtful or not--

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.340
or harmful or not.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.330
In fact, they might
even be helpful.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.850
So you guys, I think, were
the first class that I-- no--

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.265
I had you last year-- no.

00:44:38.265 --> 00:44:39.980
You guys remember
the answer to what

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.140
is the idea that a
little bit of radiation

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.920
might be good for you?

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.270
From the cash class?

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.758
Anyone remember
what that's called?

00:44:47.758 --> 00:44:48.550
AUDIENCE: Hormesis?

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.800
MICHAEL SHORT: Hormesis, yeah.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.570
This idea that a little
bit of something bad

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.220
could actually be good for you.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.560
This is also a theory,
and to my knowledge,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.660
has not been proven to be true.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.940
But it is evident in
some other studies,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.350
along with different fields
of research beyond radiation.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.270
For example, there
had been an experiment

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.300
where rats were kept
in shielded lead boxes

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.640
as opposed to just
out on the bench

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.230
where they got less radiation.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.420
And the rats that
had less radiation

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.650
had less incidence of cancer.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.770
However, it's
extremely difficult

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:24.756
to remove all other confounding
variables from this data.

00:45:24.756 --> 00:45:27.720
And that's the trick there,
is when trying to tease out,

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.640
are small amounts of
radiation bad for you?

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.600
You also have to tease
out confounding variables

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.220
or other things that might
be obscuring your data.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.440
Why the hormetic effect?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.790
So what are some of
the ideas behind why

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.120
hormesis might happen?

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.990
So there are some theories,
and some controlled studies

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.930
showing that if you
irradiate cells very lightly,

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.820
they mount an immune response.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.920
There are proteins
and things circulating

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.670
throughout your cells that
are there to repair DNA.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.040
And if you stimulate the
production of those repair

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.070
mechanisms, then the repair
will be more rapid given

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.150
the same amount of stimulus.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.727
So in this case there are--

00:46:07.727 --> 00:46:09.560
let's see-- I'm just
going to say proteins--

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.120
I can't say anything more--

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.860
that will actually
travel along DNA,

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.950
looking for certain
types of kinks or breaks

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.240
and repair them.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.670
If those repairs happen
before cell division,

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.500
then the mutation is avoided.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.450
If you have more of
those repair mechanisms,

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.880
it takes a little bit
more energy to make them,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.650
but you also have
less of a chance

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:32.160
of a mutation manifesting
itself past division number one.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.530
So this is kind at the
cellular level idea

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.810
why might hormesis
be true, because you

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.110
stimulate your body's
ability to defend

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.237
against this kind of stuff.

00:46:43.237 --> 00:46:44.070
And so there you go.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.530
Cells can actually
signal each other.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.510
So let's say a cell undergoes
DNA damage and can't divide.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.980
These cells can
actually send what

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.920
they call kill signals
in the intercelluar space

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.320
to the nearby cells,
stimulating them

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.030
to mount some sort of response.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.310
Either release
something or divide more

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.710
to make up for the dead
cells, which could be good

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.420
or which could be bad.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.760
If you make more of these
DNA repair mechanisms,

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.590
that's probably a good thing.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.300
If you stimulate
the nearby cells to

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.750
divide faster, well what are the
two things that could happen?

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:19.850
Yeah?

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:21.330
AUDIENCE: More mutations.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.740
MICHAEL SHORT: Why do
you say more mutations?

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.198
AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean, If you have

00:47:24.198 --> 00:47:26.820
cells that were in a radiation
environment, that are exposed

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.250
to that radiation
you're dividing faster,

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.740
each division has a
certain chance of mutation.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.260
More divisions overall means
more mutations [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.520
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly, yeah.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.685
If there are cells nearby that
have been exposed or mutated

00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:40.830
and you induce
faster division, you

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:44.550
may induce faster
incidence of the--

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.850
what is it-- of manifestation
of this mutation.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:49.687
But also, if-- let's
say, a few cells die

00:47:49.687 --> 00:47:51.270
and the other ones
divide to make up--

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.307
take up the slack, that
might be a good thing.

00:47:53.307 --> 00:47:55.140
This is a normal way
that you repair injury,

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.830
is upon cell death, the
cells nearby divide faster,

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.240
fill in the gaps, and try
and repair the tissue.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.750
So it's both a good thing
and can be a bad thing,

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:08.810
depending on what the nearby
cells have been exposed to.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.500
And so there's also this-- they
call that the bystander effect,

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.980
where, interestingly, you
can have biological effects

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.430
in cells that receive no
radiation exposure if they're

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.740
near cells that have
received radiation exposure.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.040
There are some awesome
experiments showing this.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.040
We had one here, back when
we had a professor that

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.750
did medical physics.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.300
She had created an
accelerator with a microbeam,

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.730
like a micron-wide
proton beam, when

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.520
you could irradiate single
cells and watch what

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.260
happens to the cells nearby.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.150
So to study in a controlled
way, this bystander effect.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.750
So if you irradiate one
cell on a glass slide,

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.535
how do the other ones respond?

00:48:45.535 --> 00:48:47.230
So you know which
one was irradiated

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.360
and you can watch what
happens to the other ones--

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.650
pretty slick.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.510
That accelerator,
actually, parts of that

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.025
live on the DANTE
proton accelerator

00:48:55.025 --> 00:48:56.650
that we now use for
physics and things.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.070
But a lot of the parts from
those machines are still here,

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.050
just the microbeams and
the cell parts aren't.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.220
And then I highlighted
a few of these passages

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:10.550
in sort of the DNA
damage bystander effect.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:13.700
One of the reasons is
when cells nearby divide,

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.530
they scale up their metabolism.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.120
They have to burn
more energy in order

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.220
to undergo division faster.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.760
And that can undergo what's
called oxidative metabolism.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.200
Cells can produce energy
aerobically or anaerobically.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.480
When you're dividing very
quickly, all of a sudden,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.450
you start burning more
oxygen to divide faster,

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:34.280
to do whatever you have to do.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.000
And that oxidative metabolism
also creates free radicals just

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.670
from normal wear and
tear to your cells.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.550
And those oxidative
byproducts may also

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.850
induce mutations in
the same primary way

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.410
that radiation does.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.770
Radiation does hydrolysis,
makes oxidative species

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.240
that damage DNA.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.450
Chemical oxidative metabolism
can produce the same sorts

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.570
of things that can damage
DNA in the same way, just

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.220
a different initial effect.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.170
I'm going to stop here,
even though we only

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.760
have a few slides to go,
because it's exactly five of.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Today we are going to see how
to use what we saw last time

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
about partial derivatives to
handle minimization or

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
maximization problems involving
functions of several variables.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Remember last time we said that
when we have a function,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
say, of two variables, x and y,
then we have actually two

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
different derivatives,
partial f, partial x,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
also called f sub x,
the derivative with respect to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
x keeping y constant.
And we have partial f,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
partial y, also called f sub y,
where we vary y and we keep x

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a constant.
And now, one thing I didn't

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
have time to tell you about but
hopefully you thought about in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
recitation yesterday,
is the approximation formula

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that tells you what happens if
you vary both x and y.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
f sub x tells us what happens
if we change x a little bit,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by some small amount delta x.
f sub y tells us how f changes,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
if you change y by a small
amount delta y.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If we do both at the same time
then the two effects will add up

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with each other,
because you can imagine that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
first you will change x and then
you will change y.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Or the other way around.
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If we change x by a certain
amount delta x,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and if we change y by the
amount delta y,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and let's say that we have z=
f(x, y) then that changes by an

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
amount which is approximately f
sub x times delta x plus f sub y

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
times delta y.
And that is one of the most

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
important formulas about partial
derivatives.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The intuition for this,
again, is just the two effects

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of if I change x by a small
amount and then I change y.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Well, first changing x will
modify f, how much does it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
modify f?
The answer is the rate change

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is f sub x.
And if I change y then the rate

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of change of f when I change y
is f sub y.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So all together I get this
change as a value of f.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And, of course,
that is only an approximation

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
formula.
Actually, there would be higher

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
order terms involving second and
third derivatives and so on.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:43.000
One way to justify this --
Sorry.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I was distracted by the
microphone.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
OK.
How do we justify this formula?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Well, one way to think about it
is in terms of tangent plane

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
approximation.
Let's think about the tangent

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
plane with regard to a function
f.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We have some pictures to show
you.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It will be easier if I show you
pictures.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Remember, partial f,
partial x was obtained by

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
looking at the situation where y
is held constant.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
That means I am slicing the
graph of f by a plane that is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
parallel to the x,
z plane.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And when I change x,
z changes, and the slope of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that is going to be the
derivative with respect to x.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, if I do the same in the
other direction then I will have

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
similarly the slope in a slice
now parallel to the y,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
z plane that will be partial f,
partial y.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In fact, in each case,
I have a line.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And that line is tangent to the
surface.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Now, if I have two lines
tangent to the surface,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
well, then together they
determine for me the tangent

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
plane to the surface.
Let's try to see how that works.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We know that f sub x and f sub
y are the slopes of two tangent

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
lines to this plane,
two tangent lines to the graph.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And let's write down the
equations of these lines.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I am not going to write
parametric equations.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I am going to write them in
terms of x, y,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
z coordinates.
Let's say that partial f of a

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
partial x at the given point is
equal to a.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
That means that we have a line
given by the following

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
conditions.
I am going to keep y constant

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
equal to y0.
And I am going to change x.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And, as I change x,
z will change at the rate that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is equal to a.
That would be z = 0 a(x - x0).

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
That is how you would describe
a line that, I guess,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the one that is plotted in
green here, been dissected with

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the slice parallel to the x,
z plane.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I hold y constant equal to y0.
And z is a function of x that

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
varies with a rate of a.
And now if I look similarly at

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the other slice,
let's say that the partial with

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
respect to y is equal to b,
then I get another line which

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is obtained by the fact that z
now will depend on y.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And the rate of change with
respect to y will be b.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
While x is held constant equal
to x0.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
These two lines are both going
to be in the tangent plane to

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the surface.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
They are both tangent to the
graph of f and together they

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
determine the plane.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that plane is just given by
the formula z = z0 a( x - x0) b

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
( y - y0).
If you look at what happens --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is the equation of a plane.
z equals constant times x plus

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
constant times y plus constant.
And if you look at what happens

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
if I hold y constant and vary x,
I will get the first line.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
If I hold x constant and vary
y, I get the second line.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Another way to do it,
of course,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
would provide actually
parametric equations of these

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
lines,
get vectors along them and then

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
take the cross-product to get
the normal vector to the plane.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And then get this equation for
the plane using the normal

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
vector.
That also works and it gives

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
you the same formula.
If you are curious of the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
exercise, do it again using
parametrics and using

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
cross-product to get the plane
equation.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That is how we get the tangent
plane.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And now what this approximation
formula here says is that,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in fact, the graph of a
function is close to the tangent

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
plane.
If we were moving on the

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
tangent plane,
this would be an actual

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
equality.
Delta z would be a linear

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
function of delta x and delta y.
And the graph of a function is

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
near the tangent plane,
but is not quite the same,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
so it is only an approximation
for small delta x and small

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000
delta y.
The approximation formula says

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:57.000
the graph of f is close to its
tangent plane.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And we can use that formula
over here now to estimate how

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the value of f changes if I
change x and y at the same time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Questions about that?
Now that we have caught up with

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
what we were supposed to see on
Tuesday, I can tell you now

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
about max and min problems.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That is going to be an
application of partial

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.000
derivatives to look at
optimization problems.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Maybe ten years from now,
when you have a real job,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
your job might be to actually
minimize the cost of something

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
or maximize the profit of
something or whatever.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But typically the function that
you will have to strive to

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
minimize or maximize will depend
on several variables.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
If you have a function of one
variable, you know that to find

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
its minimum or its maximum you
look at the derivative and set

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that equal to zero.
And you try to then look at

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what happens to the function.
Here it is going to be kind of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
similar, except,
of course, we have several

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
derivatives.
For today we will think about a

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
function of two variables,
but it works exactly the same

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
if you have three variables,
ten variables,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
a million variables.
The first observation is that

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:17.000
if we have a local minimum or a
local maximum then both partial

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
derivatives,
so partial f partial x and

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
partial f partial y,
are both zero at the same time.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Why is that?
Well, let's say that f of x is

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
zero.
That means when I vary x to

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
first order the function doesn't
change.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Maybe that is because it is
going through...

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
If I look only at the slice
parallel to the x-axis then

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
maybe I am going through the
minimum.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But if partial f,
partial y is not 0 then

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
actually, by changing y,
I could still make a value

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
larger or smaller.
That wouldn't be an actual

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
maximum or minimum.
It would only be a maximum or

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
minimum if I stay in the slice.
But if I allow myself to change

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
y that doesn't work.
I need actually to know that if

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I change y the value will not
change either to first order.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
That is why you also need
partial f, partial y to be zero.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Now, let's say that they are
both zero.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Well, why is that enough?
It is essentially enough

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
because of this formula telling
me that if both of these guys

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
are zero then to first order the
function doesn't change.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Then, of course,
there will be maybe quadratic

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
terms that will actually turn
that, you know,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
this won't really say that your
function is actually constant.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It will just tell you that
maybe it will actually be

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
quadratic or higher order in
delta x and delta y.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That is what you expect to have
at a maximum or a minimum.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The condition is the same thing
as saying that the tangent plane

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to the graph is actually going
to be horizontal.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And that is what you want to
have.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Say you have a minimum,
well, the tangent plane at this

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
point, at the bottom of the
graph is going to be horizontal.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And you can see that on this
equation of a tangent plane,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
when both these coefficients
are 0 that is when the equation

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
becomes z equals constant:
the horizontal plane.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Does that make sense?
We will have a name for this

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
kind of point because,
actually,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
what we will see very soon is
that these conditions are

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
necessary but are not
sufficient.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
There are actually other kinds
of points where the partial

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
derivatives are zero.
Let's give a name to this.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:24.000
We say the definition is (x0,
y0) is a critical point of f --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:36.000
-- if the partial derivative,
with respect to x,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and partial derivative with
respect to y are both zero.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Generally, you would want all
the partial derivatives,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
no matter how many variables
you have, to be zero at the same

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:06.000
time.
Let's see an example.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Let's say I give you the
function f(x;y)= x^2 - 2xy 3y^2

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
2x - 2y.
And let's try to figure out

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
whether we can minimize or
maximize this.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
What we would start doing
immediately is taking the

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
partial derivatives.
What is f sub x?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It starts with 2x - 2y 0 2.
Remember that y is a constant

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000
so this differentiates to zero.
Now, if we do f sub y,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000
that is going to be 0-2x 6y-2.
And what we want to do is set

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
these things to zero.
And we want to solve these two

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
equations at the same time.
An important thing to remember,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and maybe I should have told
you a couple of weeks ago

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
already,
if you have two equations to

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
solve, well,
it is very good to try to

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
simplify them by adding them
together or whatever,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
but you must keep two equations.
If you have two equations,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
you shouldn't end up with just
one equation out of nowhere.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
For example here,
we can certainly simplify

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
things by summing them together.
If we add them together,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
well, the x's cancel and the
constants cancel.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
In fact, we are just left with
4y for zero.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
That is pretty good.
That tells us y should be zero.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But then we should,
of course, go back to these and

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
see what else we know.
Well, now it tells us,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
if you put y = 0 it tells you
2x 2 = 0.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:26.000
That tells you x = - 1.
We have one critical point that

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
is (x, y) = (- 1;
0).

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Any questions so far?
No.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Well, you should have a
question.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
The question should be how do
we know if it is a maximum or a

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
minimum?
Yeah.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
If we had a function of one
variable, we would decide things

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
based on the second derivative.
And, in fact,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
we will see tomorrow how to do
things based on the second

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
derivative.
But that is kind of tricky

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
because there are a lot of
second derivatives.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I mean we already have two
first derivatives.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
You can imagine that if you
keep taking partials you may end

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
up with more and more,
so we will have to figure out

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
carefully what the condition
should be.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000
We will do that tomorrow.
For now, let's just try to look

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:38.000
a bit at how do we understand
these things by hand?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
In fact, let me point out to
you immediately that there is

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
more than maxima and minima.
Remember, we saw the example of

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
x^2 y^2.
That has a critical point.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
That critical point is
obviously a minimum.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And, of course,
it could be a local minimum

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
because it could be that if you
have a more complicated function

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
there is indeed a minimum here,
but then elsewhere the function

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
drops to a lower value.
We call that just a local

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
minimum to say that it is a
minimum if you stick two values

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
that are close enough to that
point.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Of course, you also have local
maximum, which I didn't plot,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
but it is easy to plot.
That is a local maximum.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
But there is a third example of
critical point,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
and that is a saddle point.
The saddle point,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
it is a new phenomena that you
don't really see in single

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
variable calculus.
It is a critical point that is

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
neither a minimum nor a maximum
because, depending on which

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
direction you look in,
it's either one or the other.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
See the point in the middle,
at the origin,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
is a saddle point.
If you look at the tangent

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
plane to this graph,
you will see that it is

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
actually horizontal at the
origin.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
You have this mountain pass
where the ground is horizontal.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
But, depending on which
direction you go,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
you go up or down.
So, we say that a point is a

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
saddle point if it is neither a
minimum or a maximum.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Possibilities could be a local
min, a local max or a saddle.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Tomorrow we will see how to
decide which one it is,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
in general, using second
derivatives.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
For this time,
let's just try to do it by

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
hand.
I just want to observe,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
in fact, I can try to,
you know,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
these examples that I have
here,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
they are x^2 y^2, y^2 - x^2,
they are sums or differences of

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
squares.
And, if we know that we can put

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
things as sum of squares for
example, we will be done.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Let's try to express this maybe
as the square of something.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
The main problem is this 2xy.
Observe we know something that

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
starts with x^2 - 2xy but is
actually a square of something

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
else.
It would be x^2 - 2xy y^2,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
not plus 3y2.
Let's try that.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So, we are going to complete
the square.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I am going to say it is x minus
y squared, so it gives me the

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
first two terms and also the y2.
Well, I still need to add two

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000
more y^2, and I also need to
add, of course,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
the 2x and - 2y.
It is still not simple enough

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
for my taste.
I can actually do better.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
These guys look like a sum of
squares, but here I have this

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
extra stuff, 2x - 2y.
Well, that is 2 (x - y).

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
It looks like maybe we can
modify this and make this into

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
another square.
So, in fact,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I can simplify this further to
(x - y 1)^2.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That would be (x - y)^2 2( x -
y), and then there is a plus

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
one.
Well, we don't have a plus one

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
so let's remove it by
subtracting one.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And I still have my 2y^2.
Do you see why this is the same

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
function?
Yeah.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Again, if I expand x minus y
plus one squared,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I get (x - y)^2 2 (x - y) 1.
But I will have minus one that

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
will cancel out and then I have
a plus 2y^2.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Now, what I know is a sum of
two squared minus one.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And this critical point,
(x,y) = (-1;0),

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
that is actually when this is
zero and that is zero,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
so that is the smallest value.
This is always greater or equal

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
to zero, the same with that one,
so that is always at least

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
minus one.
And minus one happens to be the

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000
value at the critical point.
So, it is a minimum.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Now, of course here I was very
lucky.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I mean, generally,
I couldn't expect things to

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
simplify that much.
In fact, I cheated.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I started from that,
I expanded, and then that is

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
how I got my example.
The general method will be a

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
bit different,
but you will see it will

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
actually also involve completing
squares.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Just there is more to it than
what we have seen.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
We will come back to this
tomorrow.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Sorry?
How do I know that this equals

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:09.000
-- How do I know that the whole
function is greater or equal to

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
negative one?
Well, I wrote f of x,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
y as something squared plus
2y^2 - 1.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
This squared is always a
positive number and not a

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
negative.
It is a square.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
The square of something is
always non-negative.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Similarly, y^2 is also always
non-negative.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So if you add something that is
at least zero plus something

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
that is at least zero and you
subtract one,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
you get always at least minus
one.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And, in fact,
the only way you can get minus

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
one is if both of these guys are
zero at the same time.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:17.000
That is how I get my minimum.
More about this tomorrow.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
In fact,
what I would like to tell you

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
about now instead is a nice
application of min,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
max problems that maybe you
don't think of as a min,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
max problem that you will see.
I mean you will think of it

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
that way because probably your
calculator can do it for you or,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
if not, your computer can do it
for you.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
But it is actually something
where the theory is based on

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
minimization in two variables.
Very often in experimental

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
sciences you have to do
something called least-squares

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
intercalation.
And what is that about?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Well, it is the idea that maybe
you do some experiments and you

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
record some data.
You have some data x and some

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
data y.
And, I don't know,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
maybe, for example,
x is -- Maybe your measuring

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
frogs and you're trying to
measure how bit the frog leg is

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
compared to the eyes of the
frog,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
or you're trying to measure
something.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And if you are doing chemistry
then it could be how much you

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
put of some reactant and how
much of the output product that

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
you wanted to synthesize
generated.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
All sorts of things.
Make up your own example.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
You measure basically,
for various values of x,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
what the value of y ends up
being.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And then you like to claim
these points are kind of

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
aligned.
And, of course,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
to a mathematician they are not
aligned.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
But, to an experimental
scientist, that is evidence that

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
there is a relation between the
two.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And so you want to claim -- And
in your paper you will actually

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
draw a nice little line like
that.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
The functions depend linearly
on each of them.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
The question is how do we come
up with that nice line that

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
passes smack in the middle of
the points?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000
The question is,
given experimental data xi,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
yi -- Maybe I should actually
be more precise.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
You are given some experimental
data.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
You have data points x1,
y1, x2, y2 and so on,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
xn, yn,
the question would be find the

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
"best fit"
line of a form y equals ax b

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
that somehow approximates very
well this data.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
You can also use that right
away to predict various things.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
For example,
if you look at your new

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
homework,
actually the first problem asks

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
you to predict how many iPods
will be on this planet in ten

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
years looking at past sales and
how they behave.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
One thing, right away,
before you lose all the money

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
that you don't have yet,
you cannot use that to predict

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
the stock market.
So, don't try to use that to

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:52.000
make money.
It doesn't work.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
One tricky thing here that I
want to draw your attention to

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
is what are the unknowns here?
The natural answer would be to

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
say that the unknowns are x and
y.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
That is not actually the case.
We are not going to solve for

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
some x and y.
I mean we have some values

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
given to us.
And, when we are looking for

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that line, we don't really care
about the perfect value of x.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
What we care about is actually
these coefficients a and b that

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
will tell us what the relation
is between x and y.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
In fact, we are trying to solve
for a and b that will give us

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
the nicest possible line for
these points.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
The unknowns,
in our equations,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
will have to be a and b,
not x and y.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
The question really is find the
"best"

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
a and b.
And, of course,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
we have to decide what we mean
by best.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Best will mean that we minimize
some function of a and b that

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
measures the total errors that
we are making when we are

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
choosing this line compared to
the experimental data.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Maybe, roughly speaking,
it should measure how far these

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
points are from the line.
But now there are various ways

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
to do it.
And a lot of them are valid

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
they give you different answers.
You have to decide what it is

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
that you prefer.
For example,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
you could measure the distance
to the line by projecting

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
perpendicularly.
Or you could measure instead,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
for a given value of x,
the difference between the

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
experimental value of y and the
predicted one.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And that is often more relevant
because these guys actually may

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
be expressed in different units.
They are not the same type of

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
quantity.
You cannot actually combine

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
them arbitrarily.
Anyway, the convention is

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
usually we measure distance in
this way.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Next, you could try to minimize
the largest distance.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Say we look at who has the
largest error and we make that

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
the smallest possible.
The drawback of doing that is

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
experimentally very often you
have one data point that is not

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
good because maybe you fell
asleep in front of the

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
experiment.
And so you didn't measure the

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
right thing.
You tend to want to not give

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
too much importance to some data
point that is far away from the

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
others.
Maybe instead you want to

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
measure the average distance or
maybe you want to actually give

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
more weight to things that are
further away.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And then you don't want to do
the distance with a square of

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
the distance.
There are various possible

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
answers, but one of them gives
us actually a particularly nice

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
formula for a and b.
And so that is why it is the

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
universally used one.
Here it says list squares.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
That's because we will measure,
actually, the sum of the

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
squares of the errors.
And why do we do that?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Well, part of it is because it
looks good.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
When you see this plot in
scientific papers they really

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
look like the line is indeed the
ideal line.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And the second reason is
because actually the

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
minimization problem that we
will get is particularly simple,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
well-posed and easy to solve.
So we will have a nice formula

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
for the best a and the best b.
If you have a method that is

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
simple and gives you a good
answer then that is probably

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
good.
We have to define best.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Here it is in the sense of
minimizing the total square

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
error.
Or maybe I should say total

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
square deviation instead.
What do I mean by this?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.000
The deviation for each data
point is the difference between

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
what you have measured and what
you are predicting by your

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
model.
That is the difference between

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:11.000
y1 and axi plus b.
Now, what we will do is try to

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:25.000
minimize the function capital D,
which is just the sum for all

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:36.000
the data points of the square of
a deviation.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Let me go over this again.
This is a function of a and b.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Of course there are a lot of
letters in here,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
but xi and yi in real life
there will be numbers given to

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
you.
There will be numbers that you

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
have measured.
You have measured all of this

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
data.
They are just going to be

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
numbers.
You put them in there and you

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
get a function of a and b.
Any questions?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
How do we minimize this
function of a and b?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Well, let's use your knowledge.
Let's actually look for a

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
critical point.
We want to solve for partial d

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000
over partial a= 0,
partial d over partial b = 0.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
That is how we look for
critical points.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Let's take the derivative of
this with respect to a.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Well, the derivative of a sum
is sum of the derivatives.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And now we have to take the
derivative of this quantity

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
squared.
Remember, we take the

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
derivative of the square.
We take twice this quantity

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
times the derivative of what we
are squaring.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:26.000
We will get 2(yi - axi) b times
the derivative of this with

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
respect to a.
What is the derivative of this

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
with respect to a?
Negative xi, exactly.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And so we will want this to be
0.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And partial d over partial b,
we do the same thing,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
but different shading with
respect to b instead of with

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
respect to a.
Again, the sum of squares twice

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000
yi minus axi equals b times the
derivative of this with respect

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
to b is, I think,
negative one.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Those are the equations we have
to solve.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Well, let's reorganize this a
little bit.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
The first equation.
See, there are a's and there

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
are b's in these equations.
I am going to just look at the

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
coefficients of a and b.
If you have good eyes,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
you can see probably that these
are actually linear equations in

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
a and b.
There is a lot of clutter with

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
all these x's and y's all over
the place.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Let's actually try to expand
things and make that more

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
apparent.
The first thing I will do is

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
actually get rid of these
factors of two.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
They are just not very
important.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
I can simplify things.
Next, I am going to look at the

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
coefficient of a.
I will get basically a times xi

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:24.000
squared.
Let me just do it and should be

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:33.000
clear.
I claim when we simplify this

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:46.000
we get xi squared times a plus
xi times b minus xiyi.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And we set this equal to zero.
Do you agree that this is what

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
we get when we expand that
product?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Yeah. Kind of?
OK. Let's do the other one.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
We just multiply by minus one,
so we take the opposite of that

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:19.000
which would be axi plus b.
I will write that as xia plus b

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
minus yi.
Sorry. I forgot the n here.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And let me just reorganize that
by actually putting all the a's

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
together.
That means I will have sum of

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
all the xi2 times a plus sum of
xib minus sum of xiyi equal to

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
zero.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000
If I rewrite this,
it becomes sum of xi2 times a

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
plus sum of the xi's time b,
and let me move the other guys

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
to the other side,
equals sum of xiyi.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And that one becomes sum of xi
times a.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Plus how many b's do I get on
this one?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I get one for each data point.
When I sum them together,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
I will get n.
Very good.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.000
N times b equals sum of yi.
Now, this quantities look

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
scary, but they are actually
just numbers.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
For example,
this one, you look at all your

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
data points.
For each of them you take the

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
value of x and you just sum all
these numbers together.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000
What you get,
actually, is a linear system in

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
a and b, a two by two linear
system.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And so now we can solve this
for a and b.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
In practice,
of course, first you plug in

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
the numbers for xi and yi and
then you solve the system that

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
you get.
And we know how to solve two by

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
two linear systems,
I hope.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
That's how we find the best fit
line.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Now, why is that going to be
the best one instead of the

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
worst one?
We just solved for a critical

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
point.
That could actually be a

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
maximum of this error function
D.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
We will have the answer to that
next time, but trust me.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
If you really want to go over
the second derivative test that

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
we will see tomorrow and apply
it in this case,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
it is quite hard to check,
but you can see it is actually

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:28.000
a minimum.
I will just say -- -- we can

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:42.000
show that it is a minimum.
Now, the event with the linear

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
case is the one that we are the
most familiar with.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Least-squares interpolation
actually works in much more

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000
general settings.
Because instead of fitting for

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
the best line,
if you think it has a different

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
kind of relation then maybe you
can fit in using a different

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
kind of formula.
Let me actually illustrate that

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
with an example.
I don't know if you are

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
familiar with Moore's law.
It is something that is

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
supposed to tell you how quickly
basically computer chips become

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
smarter faster and faster all
the time.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
It's a law that says things
about the number of transistors

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
that you can fit onto a computer
chip.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Here I have some data about --
Here is data about the number of

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:58.000
transistors on a standard PC
processor as a function of time.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
And if you try to do a
best-line fit,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
well, it doesn't seem to follow
a linear trend.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
On the other hand,
if you plug the diagram in the

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
log scale,
the log of a number of

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
transitions as a function of
time,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000
then you get a much better line.
And so, in fact,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
that means that you had an
exponential relation between the

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
number of transistors and time.
And so, actually that's what

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Moore's law says.
It says that the number of

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
transistors in the chip doubles
every 18 months or every two

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
years.
They keep changing the

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.000
statement.
How do we find the best

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.000
exponential fit?
Well, an exponential fit would

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000
be something of a form y equals
a constant times exponential of

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
a times x.
That is what we want to look at.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Well, we could try to minimize
a square error like we did

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
before.
That doesn't work well at all.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
The equations that you get are
very complicated.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000
You cannot solve them.
But remember what I showed you

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
on this log plot.
If you plot the log of y as a

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
function of x then suddenly it
becomes a linear relation.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Observe, this is the same as ln
of y equals ln of c plus ax.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:55.000
And that is the linear best fit.
What you do is you just look

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:08.000
for the best straight line fit
for the log of y.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
That is something we already
know.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
But you can also do,
for example,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
let's say that we have
something more complicated.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Let's say that we have actually
a quadratic law.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
For example,
y is of the form ax^2 bx c.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
And, of course,
you are trying to find somehow

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
the best.
That would mean here fitting

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
the best parabola for your data
points.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Well, to do that,
you would need to find a,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
b and c.
And now you will have actually

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
a function of a,
b and c, which would be the sum

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
of the old data points of the
square deviation.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
And, if you try to solve for
critical points,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
now you will have three
equations involving a,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
b and c,
in fact, you will find a three

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
by three linear system.
And it works the same way.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Just you have a little bit more
data.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Basically, you see that this
best fit problems are an example

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
of a minimization problem that
maybe you didn't expect to see

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
minimization problems come in.
But that is really the way to

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
handle these questions.
Tomorrow we will go back to the

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
question of how do we decide
whether it is a minimum or a

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
maximum.
And we will continue exploring

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
in terms of several variables.

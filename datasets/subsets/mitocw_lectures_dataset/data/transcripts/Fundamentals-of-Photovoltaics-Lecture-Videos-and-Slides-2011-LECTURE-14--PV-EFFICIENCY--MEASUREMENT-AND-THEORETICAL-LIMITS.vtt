00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.746
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:27.579
Well, why don't we go
ahead and get started.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.790
We're going to be discussing
photovoltaic efficiency,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.150
measurement, and
theoretical limits.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.900
And there will be
plenty of natural breaks

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.560
over the course of
today's presentation

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.580
for us to have our debate.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.410
This is a fun lecture
because we start out

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.710
by talking about how to measure
solar cell device efficiency.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.520
Later, we will discuss
the theoretical efficiency

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.160
limits of solar cells.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.850
Why do we focus an entire
lecture on efficiency?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.500
Well first, as we
discussed previously,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.890
efficiency is a very strong
determining factor for cost.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.310
The rationale, again, is that
if you have low efficiency,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.690
you're going to need
more commodity materials

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.650
to make a given watt peak.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.550
That means you'll need a
larger area of solar module

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.070
to make a certain
amount of power,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.111
which means you'll need
more glass, encapsulance,

00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:14.790
and so forth.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.790
So efficiency is a
strong lever determining

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.470
cost of all downstream
components except

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.810
for the area independent
factors like the inverter.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.396
Secondly, efficiency is
tricky to measure accurately.

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:28.020
That is why there are only a few
laboratories around the world,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.570
a handful, that are certified
to measure solar cell

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.200
efficiencies.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.130
These are the
efficiencies that could

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.794
be reported in, say, the
efficiency compendiums,

00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:40.710
an example of which
you've just picked up here

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.850
as one of the readings.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.960
The reality is that we can
measure efficiency or get

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
a pretty close value for
an efficiency of a device

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.540
within our own laboratories.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.590
But there are a number
of possible errors

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.560
that can creep up and nip us in
the heel if we're not careful.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.960
And that's why we spend
some time in today's lecture

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.946
discussing those
potential pitfalls.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.570
And thirdly, there
are new technologies

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.750
that are being
promised right and left

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.889
to overcome some of
the fundamental limits

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.510
of traditional solar cell
devices, like this one right

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.820
here.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.290
And we have to understand
what those limits are so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.020
that we can design better
ways to overcome them.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.770
So learning objectives.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.950
Bit of a small font here.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190
But the idea is--
our very first point

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.370
is to identify the sources of
record solar cell efficiencies

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.860
to understand where one
goes to look them up.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.760
How do you find the record
efficiency of say, a silicon

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.820
device or a [INAUDIBLE] device?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.570
Eventually, we'll
talk about measurement

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.360
of solar cell efficiencies.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.320
And finally, the
theoretical or fundamental

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.790
limits to solar
cell efficiencies.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.380
So the key concepts for--
learning objective number one,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.770
to identify a source
for record efficiencies.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.550
My go to place is a
Progress in Photovoltaics,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.680
it's a journal and
in the PB field.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.320
And every six
months, PiP comes out

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.000
with solar cell
efficiency tables

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.260
led by one of their editors,
Martin Green, professor

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500
at University of New
South Wales in Australia.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.880
The latest addition that I
could find was version 38.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.180
I believe this was from
July or June this summer.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.990
And every six months or so, they
come out with a new version.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.160
And what you'll find
inside of that paper--

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560
this is one of the four
handouts that you have today.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.260
One of the three
articles that you have.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.140
What you'll find inside of a
typical Martin Green solar cell

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.700
efficiency table is a
listing of-- in table one,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.140
a listing of individual cells.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.800
In table two of modules.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.660
And within the cells,
any new record efficiency

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.720
will be shown in bold.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.130
Over the six months preceding
the release of the latest

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.910
version, there were indeed
four record efficiencies

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.720
that had been made.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.390
And that's pretty
impressive advance.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.420
Note one thing which
we'll come back to later.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.170
Note the plus minus
appearing here

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.800
after the efficiency number.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.140
Is anybody surprised
at that number?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.634
Ashley, did you expect
it to be that big?

00:04:12.634 --> 00:04:14.032
AUDIENCE: No, not that big.

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:14.720
PROFESSOR: Not that big, right?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.345
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:18.970
But say the record efficiency
of crystal silicon device, 25%

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.360
plus or minus 0.5.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.540
Pretty large delta.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.930
We'll explain some
of the reasons

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.770
why that error bar is so large.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.280
Another thing to keep in mind.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.495
Look at gallium arsenide
at 28.1%, just achieved

00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:37.320
by Alta Devices in March.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.940
Keep that number,
28.1 plus or minus

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.860
20% in your mind, at
least the first one, 28.1

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.900
We'll march on to the module
efficiency tables right here.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.580
So now the gallium
arsenide module efficiency

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:00.100
record for the efficiency tables
right here is 21%, or 21.1%.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.360
Crystalline silicon has dropped
from 25 to 23 and so forth.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.120
And this is fairly typical
that record module efficiencies

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.380
are in the order of 2% to 7%
lower than record efficiency

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.760
cells.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.510
Can anybody guess
why that might be?

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:19.974
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:20.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.750
You have a mix of
different performers.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.120
And when you connect them
in series and in parallel,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.330
you're going to be limited by
the lowest voltage or current,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.870
respectively.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.370
Yes.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.890
OK.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.920
So certainly there
are mismatches

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.810
between the individual
devices inside of a module.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.390
That's where the
majority of that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.200
comes from for, say,
crystalline silicon

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.020
or discrete monolithic wafers.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.430
But how about for some of
these thin film devices?

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.910
They are deposited using these
large chemical vapor deposition

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.800
reactors, for example,
or PVD reactors.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.910
And you deposit a uniform
thin film over a large area,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.680
use lasers to cut little
trenches in the films

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.550
and discretize the
devices that way.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.880
So how come there
are differences

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.000
between record cell and
record module for thin film?

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:15.780
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.320
So if you have inhomogeneities
in thickness or in composition,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.600
or even in surface
quality from region

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.400
to region in that
large area, you're

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.360
likely to reduce
your performance.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.945
One analogy, since
I know many of you

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.290
are mechanical engineers,
one analogy to this

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.570
is when you're doing tensile
tests with ceramics or brittle

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.900
specimens at room temperature,
and you pull on your specimen,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.830
and you obtain a certain
fracture stress, you then take

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.080
that smaller piece, pull again.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.970
Now the fracture
stress is higher.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.320
Pull on that smaller
piece that broke off.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.860
Yet again, another fracture
stress is even higher.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.360
In other words, in
that large specimen,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.720
there was one point
that was extremely weak,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.940
another point that
was sort of weak,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.070
and another point
that was mildly weak.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.800
And as you increase the
size of your specimen,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.440
the likelihood of having one of
these failure points increases.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.110
That's an analogy, let's say,
to a large area module, as well,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.800
if we could have pinholes
or other manufacturing

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.440
defects inside of
a large area module

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.190
that could reduce the
performance locally,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.140
and everything is
interconnected,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.430
it tends to drop the
performance overall.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.840
So we have the record
laboratory efficiencies.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.660
This is another
reference source.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.350
I am not personally aware
where Larry Kazmerski publishes

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.420
this on a regular basis.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.670
I know he maintains this table.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.760
And if you email
him very nicely,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.710
he'll email you back with
the most updated version.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.580
But I'm not aware of
any publication outlet

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.270
where this is
regularly appearing.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.770
But nevertheless, it captures
the record efficiencies

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.160
versus time the same
way that you, too,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.310
could do if you went to
the Martin Green records.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.870
And I believe we're at,
was it, number 39 now?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.370
38.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.260
We're at Version 38.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.610
And if you went back in time
to all of the different tables

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.270
and tabulated the
results versus time,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.478
you would get a plot that
looked very similar to this

00:08:10.478 --> 00:08:13.400
for each technology.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.290
So next up we're going
to identify the sources

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.240
of standard solar spectrum.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.220
So we know the
record efficiencies.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.920
We're taking their
word for it right now

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.370
that they did everything right.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.730
Now we're going to learn
what that everything is

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.860
and how to do it
right, or at least some

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.976
of the pieces of doing it right.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:33.059
We're going to identify,
first of all, the sources

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.809
of standard solar spectrum.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.740
So in one scenario
you could say, well,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.020
let me just go outside and
measure the solar spectrum.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.412
If you go outside today,
it's kind of cloudy.

00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:43.620
The spectrum would look very
different than tomorrow.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.994
And so it would
be very difficult

00:08:44.994 --> 00:08:47.184
for you to compare the
performance of your device

00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:48.850
against somebody who
might be in Germany

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.349
or somebody who
might be in Finland,

00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:51.970
or somebody who
might be in Brazil.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.940
So that's why we come up
with the standard reference

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.060
solar spectrum.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.910
And it's shown right here.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.560
The ASTM standard
reference spectrum

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.250
is shown on the nice NREL
website for air mass zero.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.660
That's in the outer reaches of
our earth's atmosphere and air

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.640
mass 1.5, which is assumed
to be a standard in, say,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.160
temperate climates.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.170
So there have been numerous
revisions to the standard.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.330
You might want to use
the latest one just

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.940
to make sure that everything
is up to proper spec.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.680
The latest standard
here, essentially they,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.490
in very pedantic
detail, walk through all

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.230
of the possible scattering
mechanisms in the atmosphere.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.620
And this is their justification
for the specific solar spectrum

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.760
that they're measuring.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.230
And so you have a nice
explanation in much detail.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.230
Let me just show you once
again the standard spectrum.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.230
You've seen this before.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.938
You've worked with it
in homework number,

00:09:57.938 --> 00:09:59.460
I believe it was one or two.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.880
And we see AM0, AM1.5
direct, and AM1.5 global,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.680
AM1.5 global being the capture
of sunlight from a full

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.540
hemisphere, direct being
looking very closely,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.480
in a very small solid angle,
directly at the sun on a sunny

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.290
day.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.720
Given these
atmospheric conditions

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.260
with a small amount of
atmospheric scattering,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.792
obtaining an integrated power
density, watts per square meter

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.000
if you integrate over all
wavelengths, it's about 90%

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.280
of the global full
hemisphere measurement.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.900
Any questions so far about this?

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.400
OK.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.070
So that's pretty straightforward
and the measurement devices

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.250
for the global and
direct measurement today.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.070
Obviously we didn't have
those fancy contraptions 60,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.680
70 years ago in quite the same
way, with the same materials

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.250
and the same design and
the same quality of glass.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.360
But we had other
measurement devices.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.080
And you'll see in a few slides
how the solar constant has been

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.970
varying as a function of time.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.280
Granted, the solar
output also varies,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.331
but our ability to measure the
solar output varies as well.

00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:09.830
So if you look at the evolution
of the solar constant versus

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.170
time, this is the
number of watts

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.760
per meter squared in the outer
reaches of our atmosphere,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.070
so AM0.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.500
And you can see that
our values have changed.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.200
So if you were to
ask, is this because

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.230
of the change of our
measurement capabilities

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.550
or because of the change of the
solar output, the people who

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.480
study the sun will tell you that
the variation in solar output

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.480
is expected to be rather small.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.250
So the likely origin of
this large fluctuation,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.990
pre-1960, is most likely
due to our ability

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.380
to measure the
spectrum accurately.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.070
So next we'll describe how to
simulate the solar spectrum

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.750
in the laboratory,
and we'll describe

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.300
how a solar simulator works.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.520
So great.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.680
We have an idealized
solar spectrum right here.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.350
How do we recreate this in
a laboratory environment?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.160
How do we obtain a
light source that

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.690
follows this profile exactly?

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:11.190
Well, barring the ability to
recreate a small fusion source

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.190
in the laboratory
and the ability

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.400
to introduce exactly
the right Fraunhofer

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.020
lines into our
spectrum, we are not

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.030
going to be able to
reproduce that exactly.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.400
But we have several techniques
that come fairly close.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.480
So the solar simulator.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.810
This is a schematic coming
off of the Newport website.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.820
Many of the solar simulators
in the laboratories

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.180
here at MIT, as you'll
see as you walk around,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.810
be Newport Oriole
or related brands,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.190
we have the light
source back here.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.080
Note the type of
the lamp right here.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.480
It's a xenon arc lamp.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.680
Mirrors, essentially
a series of optics

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.160
to create the right
form factor of the light

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.340
and ultimately work our way
toward a planar incoming beam.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.860
And the what's called spectral
correction filter, which

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.970
is right in the middle
of the optics train.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.780
And that's
essentially to correct

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.260
for variances between the
emission of the xenon arc

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.280
clamp and the ASTM solar
spectrum as defined right here.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.100
And we have a shutter, as
well, to block the light.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.580
For example, if your
device or cell or material

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.850
is photosensitive, you
might want to not expose it

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.050
for long periods of time.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.780
There's also-- when I say
photosensitive I don't mean

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.670
that the device will
stop working under light,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.370
but that the
performance will change.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.210
There are materials, for
example, amorphous silicon

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.376
that we discussed, where
the performance does change

00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:53.210
as a function of illumination,
cumulative illumination

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.420
intensity.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.890
So another interesting
thing to note here

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.880
is that we have
quasi-planar light coming

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.750
in at the end of
this optics train.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.870
But if we're going to be
measuring, for example,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.680
concentrating solar
cell apparatus,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.770
it's much more important to have
a higher degree of planarity

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.680
of the incoming light, and then
other optics would be used.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.390
One might envision,
for instance,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.140
increasing the distance
between the light source

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.350
and the actual sample,
or the optical path

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:29.320
length between the collimating
mirror and the sample.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.650
So now that we have light
approaching our sample right

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.420
here, so light is
incoming on the sample,

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.170
we have three things, broadly,
that we have to worry about.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.590
We have to worry
about uniformity

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.870
of the light, the
uniformity from small region

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.902
to region of the
illuminated area.

00:14:45.902 --> 00:14:47.610
We need to worry about
spectral fidelity.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.760
That means, how closely does
the spectrum of our lamp

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.930
match the ASTM standard
solar spectrum?

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.820
And thirdly, temporal stability.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.120
That means if I turn on
the lamp this morning

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.250
and want to take in a
measurement immediately,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.080
is it stable yet?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.580
OK.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.750
Let me wait a half hour for
things to-- for example,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.580
the thermal loads inside of
the system to reach equilibrium

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.120
with environment.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.540
Now I'm going to measure it.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.330
What if I come back
in an hour and a half?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.770
Will I still get
the same result?

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.080
What if I come back
tomorrow or next month?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.600
Temporal stability is
another major concern

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.090
for solar simulators.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.300
On the right-hand side
is just an example

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.360
of the radiance versus
wavelength of a given light

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.200
source versus time.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.080
And you can see there's a new
lamp after a certain working

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.230
period of 1,200 hours.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:45.090
So we have non-ideal
matches, several examples

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.880
of light sources that
don't quite get it right

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.620
or have several spikes
in the output spectrum.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.900
So in all cases, here
the AM1 direct spectrum

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.569
is shown in this dash dot line.

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.110
And different light
sources are shown

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.220
either solid or dashed lines.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.520
So not great.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.870
And then finally, we
reach our xenon arc lamp

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.670
with air mass filters.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.710
And the filters are to
suppress certain peaks

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.090
and certain general
portions of the spectrum

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:21.490
so that we have an approximation
of our ASTM standard reference

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.390
spectrum.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.700
And you notice that
it's not perfect.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.570
You notice that there are spikes
in the output of the xenon arc

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.130
lamp, as you might expect
from the physics involved

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.660
in the light source.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.480
This is of some
concern if your device

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.670
is particularly sensitive to
a region, a spectral region

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.540
where those might be present.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.630
So it's not a bad idea
to take a measurement

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.760
of your light source
and actually understand

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.810
how it compares, how it
matches up against the ASTM

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.370
standard spectrum.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.530
In terms of standards, or
ranking different types

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.020
of solar simulators,
there are three classes

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.849
according to the IEC standards.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.810
There are, as well,
other common standards.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.079
There's a standard
used in Japan,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.390
and the ASTM standards as well.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.589
But let's focus
on the IEC 904-9.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.540
These are the requirements
for solar simulators measuring

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.470
crystalline silicon
single junction devices.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.150
So it's a very
specific standard.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.980
And in a few slides
we'll explain

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.480
what the potential
differences are

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.500
when you're measuring other
types of solar cell materials.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.040
We have the spectral match,
or spectral fidelity.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.740
We have the non-uniformity
and the temporal instability

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.430
in this case, since
we're defining

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.470
a relatively small parameter.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.050
Class A solar simulators
have relatively tight specs.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.230
But you'll still notice
here that the non-uniformity

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.690
of the irradiance plus or minus
2%, the temporal instability

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.240
plus or minus 2%.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.890
This is where you start to
see some of those error bars

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.110
on the record efficiency
measurements, right?

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:07.690
So if a laboratory has a very
good handle on its reference

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.280
solar simulator, it will be
able to calculate these effects

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.299
and estimate what their impact
is on the actual solar cell

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.090
efficiency measure.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.610
Note that the
temporal instability

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.660
for the Japanese standard
is a little bit more

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.630
stringent than the IEC test.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.350
Minor detail, but depending
on who your collaborators are,

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.810
where they are in
the world, they

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.780
might be using a different
standard than you.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.930
Just keep that in mind.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:37.149
The solar simulator
downstairs in Building 35,

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:38.690
in the laboratory
that several of you

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.189
have seen yesterday when you
did the phosphorus diffusions--

00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:44.600
I poked my head in and
saw everybody there.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.290
So about a dozen
of you might have

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.373
walked past the solar
simulator in the laboratory.

00:18:48.373 --> 00:18:52.980
That's a large area, as
in the illuminated area

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.290
at the working plane is around
20 by 20 centimeter squared.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.380
And it is a Class
AAB solar simulator.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:07.330
So I believe that would be
spectral match, non-uniformity,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.140
and then temporal stability.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.490
So you'll typically see
solar simulators rated

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:18.220
in this way, AAA, Triple A, or
Class B solar simulator, or AAB

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.620
and so forth.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.272
So again, note the
significant figures.

00:19:22.272 --> 00:19:23.480
That's where that comes from.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.840
Pretty straightforward.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.570
Next we're going to
describe how to accurately

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.640
measure and report
cell efficiency

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.380
and some common pitfalls to
avoid when actually measuring

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.470
the cells.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.190
So this is really
directed toward people

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.100
who are doing active research
right now in the field of PV.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.710
For those who aren't, enjoy.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.430
And we'll come back as soon
as this little section is

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.490
over to the debate.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.560
And finally some topics
of general interest.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.160
So this is just a
small subset of things

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.740
to keep in mind when you're
measuring an actual solar cell.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.770
This is by no means
a comprehensive list.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.040
There are, indeed, people
who spend their entire lives

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.940
optimizing and perfecting the
art of measuring solar cells.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.480
So the very first thing
that you might want to do

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:20.730
is have a reference solar cell
encapsulated, and then mailed

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.760
to you after a measurement is
performed at a certification

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.560
laboratory.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.700
So this is an example of a
very small crystalline silicon

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.040
solar cell device inside
of an encapsulated frame.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.970
And the encapsulation
is meant to prevent

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.280
any degradation
to the solar cell,

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.350
as well as damage that might
incur during accidental use.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.310
And this cell is called
a reference cell.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.350
It was tested at NREL.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.140
The current voltage, the
short circuit current,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.700
open circuit voltage, and
fill factor of that device

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.560
is well-known and reported,
and is essentially

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.190
sent with that device
back to our laboratory.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.140
Now whenever we want to make
a new measurement on any cell

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.100
that we want to measure
inside the laboratory,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.920
we'll measure the
reference cell first just

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.760
to make sure that our solar
simulator is well-behaved.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.784
When I say well-behaved,
what could happen?

00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:18.700
Well, one of the many
things that could happen

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.350
is that the lamp
intensity decreases.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.820
That's probably the most
common thing that can happen.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.390
You'll just have an
overall reduction

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.200
in the output of your
lamp, in which case

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.880
you'll notice a reduction
in what cell parameter?

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.196
Current, voltage,
or fill factor?

00:21:34.196 --> 00:21:34.820
Current, right?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.426
So the light
intensity decreases.

00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:37.800
You'll have a
reduction primarily

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.720
in your current, logarithmic
reduction in voltage.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.190
So you have your standard
calibrated reference cell.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.860
This is definitely something
that each laboratory that

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.360
is going to be serious
about measuring efficiency

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.340
should have.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.150
This is also an apparatus that
doesn't leave our laboratory

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.300
except for class purposes.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.110
It's something we
treat very carefully,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.980
since I think the cost
ran in the few hundreds

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.850
or thousands of dollars.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.930
Avoid extraneous--
basically, avoid

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.980
light from coming
in from outside

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.490
of your solar simulator.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.326
It is often shown, or
the solar simulators

00:22:14.326 --> 00:22:16.700
are often shown in this manner
right here, where you have

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.540
everything out in the open.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.430
That's to show you
what's going on inside.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.650
When you actually
take the measurement,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.470
typically you have a
small black curtain

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:27.380
that's light tight around your
apparatus, or maybe even a box.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.680
Ensure 25 degrees C
measurement conditions.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.560
Remember that the open
circuit voltage can change,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.660
depending on the band gap.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.701
The larger the band gap,
the smaller this effect.

00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:39.260
The smaller the band gap,
the larger this effect.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.740
The VOC can change as
the temperature changes.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.480
And so it's important
to have a good handle

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.620
of your temperature.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.220
That means that you might, for
instance, have active heating

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.910
and cooling on your chuck.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.600
And you'll also, at the minimum,
be measuring the temperature

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.090
on top of the chuck, where the
actual solar cell will sit,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.720
not far away removed through
some layers of insulation

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.060
away from the chuck.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.740
Even if your temperature is
not precisely at 25 degrees

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.880
C, if you know the temperature
dependence of your solar cell,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.010
you can correct for it or
account for it to pull it back

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.700
to 25 degrees C.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.970
Next, choose your
probe locations

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.240
judiciously to avoid
series resistance losses.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.890
Let's think that
through for a second.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.455
So if we have our solar
cell device right here

00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:26.621
and we're going to be
measuring its cell efficiency,

00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:29.630
if I put one little probe
right here in the corner,

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.354
then the current that's
being generated over here

00:23:32.354 --> 00:23:34.770
has to travel a very large
distance through a lot of metal

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.010
to reach that point.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.210
But if I have probes that
essentially will consist

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.490
of many different
individual metal points,

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.780
and they come down on either
bus bar like shown right here--

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.850
where you see the green right
here, and off of the green are

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.090
many little probe tips,
individual probe tips that

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.548
will make contact
with the bus bar,

00:23:52.548 --> 00:23:54.700
so you have essentially
one coming down right here,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.860
another coming down right here--
your series resistance losses

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.040
will be much less.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.120
But one thing to keep
in mind is that when

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.990
you do have these
probes sticking

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.650
on top of your
solar cell device,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.090
they will scatter some
of the light as well.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.700
So there are best practices
in terms of what color

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:16.620
they should be and how tall
they should be, as well.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.010
So choosing the
probe location is

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.570
a large step toward
achieving high efficiencies.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.040
I don't under
emphasize that point.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.620
It really does make
a huge difference

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.290
where you put your probe
tips, especially for cells

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.320
with high series
resistance, which

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.030
can be several of the
new materials that

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.810
are being developed.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.210
Account for spectral mismatch
between calibration cell

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.140
and your cell.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.970
Let me drive that point home.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.720
So I have a crystal and silicon
calibration cell right here.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.330
I know its spectral response.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.190
I know at what wavelengths
it responds the strongest.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:58.120
And so it will detect any
mismatch between the ASTM

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.120
standard and the actual
light source there

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.130
where it responds most strongly.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.870
Now let's imagine
that I'm designing

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.030
a new organic material
that responds really well.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.390
Pick something, the infrared.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.200
And so now silicon
will stop responding,

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.520
let's say, at around
1,100 nanometers.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.810
So anything beyond here,
silicon won't be able to detect.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.660
But let's say my device
is very sensitive

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.430
in that spectral region.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.940
My silicon calibration
cell says go ahead,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.830
take your measurement,
everything's fine.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.742
It matches your ASTM standard.

00:25:30.742 --> 00:25:33.200
But then when I stick my cell
in there, all of a sudden I'm

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.857
getting a super high efficiency.

00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:36.940
I just made an organic
device, and my efficiency's

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.090
11%, which would
be a world record.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.910
I'm ecstatic.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:47.080
I'm really happy until I do
the quantum efficiency of both

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.240
the standard calibration
cell and my new cell,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.620
and I realize, wait a second.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.350
They're nowhere near
each other in terms

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.380
of their responsivity, what
region of the solar spectrum

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.930
they can respond well at.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.900
And the reason I'm
bringing that up

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.726
is, again, to
emphasize we have, say,

00:26:04.726 --> 00:26:06.850
for example, an amorphous
silicon device, a gallium

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.930
arsenide device over here,
a SiGs device showing

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.080
the different regions
of the solar spectrum,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.880
the solar spectrum shown in this
dark orange in the background

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.390
right here, peaking
at around 550.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.080
We can see that the
different materials

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.200
are responding to different
regions of the solar spectrum.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.700
And crystalline
silicon would be in

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.084
between the amorphous
silicon-- actually,

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.500
it would be a
little further over,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:33.510
be starting up at around between
1,200 and 1,100 nanometers.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.280
So we can see how
different materials

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.990
are more sensitive to different
regions of the solar spectrum.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.649
And there's even a
standard test method

00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:42.190
for determining the
spectral mismatch

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.980
parameter between your device
and the reference cell, an ASTM

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.890
standard for it.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.870
And the typical way
to account for this

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.190
is to measure the
spectral irradiance

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.400
as a function of wavelength
of your light source,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.590
measure the quantum efficiency,
meaning the responsivity versus

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.520
wavelength of your device, and
then measure your calibration

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.310
cell.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.040
And using that
math, you can really

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.630
begin to normalize for
these extraneous effects.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.940
Why do I bring that up?

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.280
I bring that up
because there was

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.100
an example, several examples,
of folks in the literature--

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.200
I've taken off their
names, so protecting

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.450
the innocent here-- folks
in the literature who

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.880
report very high efficiency
devices, or at the time

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.100
was a near-record
efficiency device.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.730
What they showed were the
QE curves of the devices,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.440
and then the IV curves
of their devices.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.340
And you guys, in your homeworks,
calculated the short circuit

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.750
current, which is shown here--
essentially the intercept

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.170
with the y-axis-- you
calculated the short circuit

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.030
current from the QE.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.180
So you know how to
perform that calculation.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.070
Well, guess what?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.450
Folks at NREL also know
how to do that calculation,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.830
and a whole lot more.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.560
So the folks at NREL did that
and said, well, wait a second.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.700
When I do the
integration of your QE,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.340
I'm not getting these short
circuit currents over here.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.990
I suspect what happened was,
in your solar simulator,

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.887
you were using a
silicon reference cell.

00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:03.220
But your cells were more
sensitive to a different region

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.850
of the solar spectrum--
in this particular case

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.270
they were more sensitive to
the shorter wavelengths--

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.520
and you didn't have a properly
calibrated solar simulator.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.470
So you're over reporting
your current outputs.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.310
And of course that's very
embarrassing for a group.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.010
In this particular case there
were merits on both sides.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.290
There was a rebuttal
to the rebuttal.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.850
So it's not a simple
black and white case

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.220
for this particular story,
although the logic does

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.340
fall more strongly on one side.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.220
So this is to say, avoid
this sort of controversy.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.510
Perform your
measurements properly,

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.410
don't over report
your efficiencies,

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.400
and when in doubt, you can
always ship your cells to NREL

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.910
or [INAUDIBLE] or another
certified testing center

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.890
and get a certified
cell efficiency.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.234
Then you can place your IV curve
inside of your publication,

00:28:59.234 --> 00:29:00.650
and in the little
corner over here

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.880
it'll have the figure
of NREL or [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.134
and the properly
certified information.

00:29:07.134 --> 00:29:08.550
Now that can be
rather complicated

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.800
if you're, for example,
growing organic materials that

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.310
degrade quickly.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.480
Somehow you have to
transport it over there

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.020
without it degrading.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.300
And that's where arranging
in advance the transfer

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.320
of the materials, and
perhaps even looking

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.790
into what sort of
transfer chamber

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.850
you're going to encapsulate your
device in could be of interest.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.420
But at the very least,
please, please, please

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.690
remember spectral
response mismatch

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.440
when you're doing
efficiency measurements.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.320
Any questions so far?

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:49.406
AUDIENCE: So then does NREL
also make non-silicon reference

00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:50.690
cells?

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.500
PROFESSOR: So NREL actually
doesn't make these cells.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.220
They're local
companies that live

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.770
right around NREL that are
manufacturing these and putting

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.930
them together.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.090
NREL will test those cells.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.740
Since it takes a few
months, typically,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.824
to get turnaround on a cell
efficiency measurement--

00:30:06.824 --> 00:30:08.990
unless you're fast tracked
in because your device is

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.090
degrading or you've
arranged in advance

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.200
and kind of put your place
in line-- because it takes

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.020
a few months turnaround,
there's actually

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.670
a premium on inventory.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.880
And so these companies will
manufacture the devices,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.754
send them in, get them
tested and calibrated,

00:30:21.754 --> 00:30:24.646
or get the calibrated
measurements performed at NREL,

00:30:24.646 --> 00:30:26.270
and then bring them
back to the company

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.645
and put them on the shelf
until you put pick up the phone

00:30:28.645 --> 00:30:31.430
and call them and say,
I'd like a certified cell.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.830
You can actually
make your own, too,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.590
if you follow a set
of standard protocols

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.430
that you can receive
from the folks at NREL.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.910
I believe Keith Emery might be
a good point contact at first.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.990
There are a very
specific set of protocols

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.406
that you should
follow if you want

00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:49.050
to make your own in the lab.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.630
In other words,
you have to design

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.350
the contacts a certain way,
the encapsule in a certain way,

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.000
make sure that the materials
comprising the remainder

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.070
are black so that they don't
reflect the light back in,

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.140
little details that are
only gathered by experience.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.740
If you follow all
of those parameters,

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.444
and the folks over there,
Keith Emery or Paul [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:09.444 --> 00:31:11.110
look at it, and they
inspect it and say,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.990
yeah, yeah, looks good,
then you can get that tested

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.130
and serve as a
calibration cell as well.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.860
So you can circumvent some
of the cost associated

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.340
with buying a certified
cell from a company.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.000
But there is a premium to them.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.610
They don't tend to be
particularly cheap.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.615
So yeah, if you have
another material

00:31:34.615 --> 00:31:36.770
and you'd like to
have it calibrated,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.690
you can make your own
calibration reference standard

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.430
as long as it doesn't degrade.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.315
Question.

00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:45.690
AUDIENCE: Putting
the multiple contact

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.540
in yours while you're
measuring the efficiency.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.730
Is that very representative
of the devices that

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.855
actually work in the field?

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.400
PROFESSOR: So there
are a lot of things--

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.740
let me spend a minute waxing
poetic about the discrepancies

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.510
between these cell
efficiency measurements

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.340
and what actual cells
experience in the field.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.380
We understand the logic behind
cell efficiency measurements.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.070
We understand we have to have
a universal way of comparing

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.670
a cell in Japan, in Boston,
in Freiburg, Germany.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.840
So we understand that we
need some standard method

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.980
of cell measurement.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.180
This cell measurement
proves very useful when

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.340
you measure the output
in terms of peak watts,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.030
because then you can multiply
by the number of peak hours

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.910
of sunlight per day and estimate
the energy output as a function

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.310
of location on the earth.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.180
So it has its uses.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.900
Now as to its drawbacks.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.520
We're measuring at
25 degrees Celsius.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.810
These cells are typically
operating around 60.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.940
We know that there's a voltage
drop, primarily a voltage drop

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.410
with increasing temperature.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.460
That's point one.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.880
Point number two, the
contacting scheme.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.360
Typically on these
devices in a module,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.510
you'll have soldered
contacts in the front,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.480
and so they make contact
with the entire bus bar,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.770
but really, depending on
your soldering machine,

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.820
only in a few locations
where there's really

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.980
a good electrical contact, and
on the back in three locations.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.970
So yes, there are differences
in how the cell is

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.720
contacted in real life.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.335
Could be one of the reasons for
discrepancies between module

00:33:18.335 --> 00:33:22.230
and cell efficiency, probably
one of the minor ones compared

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.820
to homogeneities.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.530
Why don't we take a
quick little pause

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.460
right here before we dive
into describing the efficiency

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.210
limitations of a typical
cell and get some cool demos

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.430
at the very end.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.100
What we're going to do is
have ourselves a quick debate.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.450
So I'd like to call forward
at the front of the room

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.660
the representatives of the
two teams, one of which

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.020
is going to debate in favor
of the development of novel

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.190
materials for solar cells.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.930
Let me give you an example
of one material that's

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.940
attracted quite a bit of
attention, which is pyrite.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.400
I can pass this around as folks
are coming up to the front.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.420
Here's an example of an
iron sulfide-based mineral

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.699
which is purported to
have a very high degree

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.710
of manufacturability because of
the large resource abundance,

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.030
and also the large
refining capacity

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.920
for the respective
elemental constituents.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.350
There is a gap between the
performance of current pyrite

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:30.909
cells and their theoretical
record efficiencies, quite

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.540
substantial, the
record efficiency being

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.524
up closer to 20%, the
actual efficiency being down

00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:39.060
at around two.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.909
That is not unlike, for
example, tin sulfide,

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.459
or other related materials.

00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:46.250
I'd say copper zinc
tin sulfide is probably

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.389
the most advanced at around
10%, but still about half

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.797
of its theoretical limit.

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:52.880
And so the big question
that we're going to debate

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.870
is, does it make sense
to invest a lot of funds

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.280
to come up with these
earth abundant alternatives

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.910
for our existing
solar cell materials,

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.120
our cadtel, our copper
indium gallium selenide,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.350
cognizant that
the supply of some

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.940
of these heavier elements,
tellurium and indium,

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940
is limited.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.520
And we may not have enough of
these elements in the earth's

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.560
crust to scale up to
the terawatts level.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.050
And so we'll hear
two points of view,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.280
one in favor of development of
new materials, and one against.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.490
And just to situate ourselves
in a position or a location

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.820
where these debates
actually do happen,

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.600
you can imagine
yourself, for example,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.260
in the Office of Science
and Technology Policy,

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.790
which reports directly
to Barack Obama.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:40.730
These are about 50 PhDs
who are all in an office

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.389
under the direction
of a director,

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:46.680
thinking deeply about some
of the scientific challenges

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.100
that our nation faces and the
proper scientific response,

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.480
coordinating amongst many
agencies, including the DOD,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.360
DOE, NSF, and so forth.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.430
And so you can picture
yourselves in a debate,

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.530
in a lively discussion,
all friendly,

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:03.420
but really with the potential
to influence national policy.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.590
Do we direct resource funds
to develop these novel, earth

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.270
abundant alternatives that we
might need in 10 years' time?

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.692
Or do we focus and allocate
resources elsewhere?

00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:15.900
So I'll welcome the two
participants up to the front.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.960
So folks want some
insight into where

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.880
the Office of Science
and Technology Policy

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.400
actually decided to go.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.410
A gentleman who took a version
of this course in Berkeley

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:40.970
in 2003, I think it was,
his name is Cyrus Wadia.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.900
Graduated with his
PhD from Berkeley

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.890
and actually went off to
join Office of Science

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:45.860
and Technology Policy.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.120
He took his class project
for the PB course, which

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.770
was analyzing
alternative materials

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:55.200
and published that
paper that you

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.570
read by Cyrus Wadia
on resource abundance

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.100
that was published in 2009,
for that work earned himself

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.220
a TR 35 reward from Tech
Review, and then joined

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.600
the Obama administration's
OSTP, and has

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.040
been developing the Materials
Genome Project within OSTP.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.750
The first solicitation
for proposals was issued,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.230
I believe, a week
and a half ago.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.630
So that's funneled
through the NSF.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.760
But it's a larger
effort to develop

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.920
some of these materials
involving NSFD, DOD, DOE,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.950
and so forth.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:35.360
So it actually did come
to fruition through OSTP.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.174
Budgeting is always the
big question, though,

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:41.590
because that, of
course, gets done

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.180
through the
committees in Congress

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.660
and ultimately reconciled
between the House

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.750
and the Senate, and has
to make it through OMB

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.295
and finally to the
individual directorates.

00:37:52.295 --> 00:37:55.170
So that's how things
actually get done.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:57.490
But it takes the vision
of OSTP, sometimes,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.350
to drive these larger
projects forward.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.757
So we'll wish him the best.

00:38:01.757 --> 00:38:03.840
We're going to describe
the efficiency limitations

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.990
of a typical solar cell now.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.300
And what I'll do is I'll pass
around some of these books

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.790
just to, again,
situate ourselves.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.620
Did I grab Jenny
Nelson's on the way out?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.610
Thought I did.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:16.600
Hm.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.280
OK.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.020
Well.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.700
Peter Wurfel and--
oh, there it is.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.300
Yes, absolutely.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.190
So there's two books
that are entitled

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.320
Physics of Solar Cells.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.820
You can see it's a
very popular topic.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.180
And one is The
Photovoltaic Handbook.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.810
All refer to some aspect
of efficiency limits.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.320
And as you look
through your sheets,

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.110
you'll see at the
bottom, typically

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:44.620
the different pages of each
of the books are listed here.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.890
So the very first thing
that we should consider

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.180
before we get into
PV technology,

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.050
we just have some solar
device looking at the sun.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:39:00.650
And the sun is radiating at it
at 6,000 Kelvin, 5,800 Kelvin.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.920
And it, the solar contraption
on the surface the earth,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.790
is radiating back at the sun
with black body radiation

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.210
at 300 Kelvin.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.410
So much lower power from
Stefan Boltzmann's Law

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.020
we know exactly
the amount of power

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.350
being emitted by that device.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.090
So the two are
radiating at each other,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.330
and they're in equilibrium.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:24.172
And that results
in the very first,

00:39:24.172 --> 00:39:25.630
we'll call it
blackbody efficiency,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.780
or maximum solar heat
engine efficiency,

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.280
which would be around 86%.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.570
So that's our first
fundamental cutoff.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.680
Now that 86% is averaged
over all wavelengths.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.350
There tends to be a wavelength
dependence to this as well.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.760
So the next step was
to say, OK, well,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.240
we know that we
can't do better than

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.470
the theoretical
thermodynamic limit of one

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.930
object looking at another.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.230
But what is the actual
limit of a solar cell?

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.160
And this was a question
that the first developers

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.710
of the solar cell
asked themselves.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.580
So Prince was one of the
three of the team that

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.300
in 1954 published on the crystal
silicon solar cell device,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.700
and very quickly followed
it up with another article

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.420
here in JP focused on the
theoretical efficiency limit.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:19.050
And a curve was proposed,
looking much like this,

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.760
with two data points for
germanium and silicon,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.880
theoretical limits, that
is, and power density.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.120
So not a conversion efficiency
per se, but a power density.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.850
And of course, assuming a
certain input power density,

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.950
one can calculate an
efficiency from there.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:39.220
And along came--
well, at this time,

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:45.000
H-J Queisser had just moved
over from Germany to Palo Alto,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.030
to The Apricot Barn, and
working with Shockley,

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.540
the esteemed
Shockley at the time,

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.000
to develop a detailed
balance model

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.420
for describing how a
solar cell performs,

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.540
or what its ultimate theoretical
efficiency limit could be.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.780
Now what a detailed
balance model does

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.080
is just basically
accounting, accounting

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.567
for all of the photons coming
in and out of the device.

00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:12.400
Through the photons,
the electron hole pairs

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.340
are generated.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.050
This is assuming a very
high quality material

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.700
that does not have any
form of recombination other

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.410
than radiative recombination.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.100
So we talked about the different
methods of limiting lifetime.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.710
Radiative recombination
is one of the methods

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.911
of limiting performance
that occurs in high quality

00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:31.410
materials.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.620
If you have a poor
quality material,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.286
you'll have non-radiative
recombination,

00:41:34.286 --> 00:41:36.110
say, Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.260
But in the detailed
balance model,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.327
only radiative
recombination was assumed.

00:41:40.327 --> 00:41:42.410
That way you can count
number of photons coming in

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.620
and number of photons
going out of your device.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.930
Furthermore, they assumed
that the mobility of carriers

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.844
was infinite inside
of their material.

00:41:51.844 --> 00:41:54.010
A few laughs over here
coming from the folks who are

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.370
working on organic materials.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.060
But it's true.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.080
They assumed that the
mobility was infinite,

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.480
such that the separation
of the quasi Fermi

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.000
energies throughout the
entire device was equal.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.412
So if you had a
limited mobility,

00:42:06.412 --> 00:42:08.370
if you had a certain
higher density of carriers

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:09.786
in the front than
toward the back,

00:42:09.786 --> 00:42:13.249
you'd have a difference
in the chemical potential

00:42:13.249 --> 00:42:14.790
through the thickness
of your device.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.110
They assumed infinite mobility.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.780
So it was a very simple,
yet elegantly insightful

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.470
model that, upon first
submission, was rejected.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.060
So the first time they submitted
this model for publication

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.850
it was rejected outright.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.140
And it took them another several
months of edits, probably

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.550
about a year, and
they resubmitted it.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.300
And then it became
a sleeper paper.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.970
It wasn't cited that much.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.846
If you go to the Web of
Science, for example,

00:42:43.846 --> 00:42:45.303
and look at this
manuscript, you'll

00:42:45.303 --> 00:42:47.440
see that the number of
citations in the early years

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.100
was rather limited.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.319
Nowadays there
isn't a talk about

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:53.860
the fundamental efficiency of
a solar cell without mentioning

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.960
the Shockley-Queisser
efficiency limit.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.050
That's coming directly
from this paper right here.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.250
And that serves as a
motivational story for you.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.390
If your paper is rejected,
just remember that now you're

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.520
along with some several
esteemed individuals who

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.800
have set precedence in
the field of photovoltaics

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.890
and are Nobel worthy.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.980
So that's my personal opinion.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.500
If you fall into that category,
don't feel discouraged.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.800
Regroup and find a way to
make your paper better.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.280
You have a copy
of this manuscript

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.200
right here, by the way, in
your handouts for today.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.840
And interestingly, through
their detailed balance model,

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:37.140
they obtained an ultimate
efficiency versus wavelength,

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.860
or energy in this
case, curve that looks

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.970
very similar to the curve that
you derived in your earlier

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.490
homeworks, where you just
assumed two loss mechanisms.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.910
One was non-absorption
of light and the other

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.680
was thermalization of carriers.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.780
So the detailed
balance model, the way

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.890
they reached this point,
is different, fundamentally

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.390
different.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.300
The physics that was
assumed is basically

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.910
listed out right here.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.430
But the end result is fairly
similar to the rough back

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.450
of the envelope calculation
that you performed

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.950
in an earlier homework.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.280
So again, just to
go up, they assumed

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.645
that the photons with energies
greater than the band gap

00:44:18.645 --> 00:44:21.490
are absorbed, create
one electron hole pair.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:22.800
They assume thermalization.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.760
So these were your
two assumptions

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.140
that you did in the homework.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.030
Then they do a few
additional things.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.760
They assume that
radiative losses

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.390
occur within the material,
that not every carrier is

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:37.140
collected-- that's
important-- so you have

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.430
radiative losses in
your device, so that

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.860
reduces the performance.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.200
And then they assume
further that there

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.800
is a thermodynamic loss in
their device, in other words,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.570
that you don't extract the
full band gap of energy,

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.760
but that there's a
thermodynamic loss

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.720
as you go from band to band,
which would be the band gap

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.140
energy, to the difference or
separation of the quasi Fermi

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.280
energies, which is
this delta mu here,

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.340
which is the change in
the chemical potential

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.620
from the front side to the
back side of the device.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.380
So there are some additional
loss terms that were included.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.760
For a full description of
the detailed balance limit,

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.530
and all the math, I
definitely encourage

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.430
you go to this website.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.050
As well, Peter Wurfel's
text does a wonderful job

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.550
of describing this.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.280
And of course, you
have your paper here.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.430
You can read through the
original paper yourself,

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.263
or perhaps suggest it
at an upcoming journal

00:45:29.263 --> 00:45:31.570
meeting for your group.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.550
Here is the calculation of the
detailed balance limit for AM0

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:40.030
and AM1.5, essentially as
a function of band gap,

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.110
coming from the PVCDROM.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.990
And you can see how silicon
and gallium arsenide are pretty

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:49.340
close to the theoretical
maximum in terms

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.820
of the theoretical maximum
efficiency for a single band

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.390
gap semiconductor material.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.320
So this curve right here,
again, is just representing one

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.820
band gap material, a
single band gap material.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.760
So let's take it from
here and venture forward

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.430
into some more realistic
performance reduction effects.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.660
We can, for instance, take
into account recombination

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.470
mechanisms that aren't
only-- for example,

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.780
that aren't only radiative.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.470
We can take Auger recombination.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.070
We can take Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination into account.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:25.070
We can also take what's called
photon recycling into account.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.280
So what is photon recycling?

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.738
Photon recycling is when you
have a radiative recombination

00:46:28.738 --> 00:46:31.550
event, and that photon gets
trapped within the material.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.010
It's not allowed to escape.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.320
But it gets trapped because,
for example, off the top,

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.660
there's an index of
refraction mismatch.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.840
Or the angle at which it
tries to exit is too oblique,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.950
and so you have total internal
reflection within your device.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.970
And you eventually
have reabsorption.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.510
So that's called
photon recycling

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.610
because you have a radiative
recombination event.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.736
It emits a photon inside
of your solar cell device,

00:46:53.736 --> 00:46:55.693
and that photon bounces
around a few more times

00:46:55.693 --> 00:46:57.070
until it's
reabsorbed, generating

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.470
another electron hole pair.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:04.010
And that is, essentially,
the major boost in some

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.590
of these ultra thin, high
performance solar cell

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.640
materials such as the Alta
Devices record efficiency 28%

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.344
gallium arsenide
cell has the ability

00:47:12.344 --> 00:47:13.510
to do this photon recycling.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.220
Now how do you modify the
detailed balance limit

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.426
to account for finite mobility?

00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:24.800
I suspect this
corner of the room

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.820
is going to want to hear this.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.660
There is a beautiful piece
of work done by [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.300
The PhD thesis is
even more insightful

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.550
than the manuscript in terms
of actually breaking down

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:39.760
each individual component.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.880
A great deal of modeling went
into this, including photon

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.090
recycling, including
some things that

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.360
are very difficult to model.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.990
And the effect of
finite mobility

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:51.260
was calculated on a modified
detailed balance limit model.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.990
And you can see
number one, that curve

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.610
that's starting here at the 20.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:02.819
That is for a mobility that
is close to the optimal.

00:48:02.819 --> 00:48:04.360
If you drop by an
order of magnitude,

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.110
or two orders of
magnitude, relative

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:11.550
to the maximum mobility
inside of a material,

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.410
your performance begins
to degrade considerably.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.680
And now you can
understand why silicon,

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.970
or crystalline
silicon, which has,

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.550
say, hole mobilities
somewhere in the range

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:28.136
of a few hundreds of centimeters
squared per volt second.

00:48:28.136 --> 00:48:29.510
So keep that number
in your mind,

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.134
on the order of
hundreds of centimeters

00:48:31.134 --> 00:48:32.590
squared per volt hole mobility.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.160
Now you compare to
amorphous silicon,

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.930
which has something in the
range of 10 to the minus 3

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.070
to 10 to the minus 1
centimeters per volt second.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:44.160
And you begin to see why those
materials with poor mobilities

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.110
are really impacted in
terms of their performance.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:51.010
There is a method to calculate
the impact of limited mobility

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.280
on device performance.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.760
And if that intrigues
you, I would definitely

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.970
refer you to this manuscript.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:59.110
One very simple way
to think about it

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.390
is, at least for
a band conductor,

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.490
you would have a certain
diffusion length.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.780
At least a first order
would be the diffusivity

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.610
times the lifetime
and the diffusivity

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:16.200
would be related to the mobility
inside of your material.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.884
So your mobility is factoring
into your diffusion length,

00:49:18.884 --> 00:49:20.800
and the diffusion length
is affecting how many

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.860
charge carriers are collected.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.860
So that's a simple way to
think about the problem.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.610
A similar related approach that
kind of pulls all this together

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:34.410
in a graphical form is
at the very last page--

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.050
some of the very last pages
of Peter Wurfel's text.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.110
And this is going through
the efficiency calculation

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.660
that we just saw, starting
from a certain amount of light

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.110
that's not absorbed.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.360
The light that is absorbed--
so that's efficiency loss

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.535
mechanism number one--
for a thin device,

00:49:49.535 --> 00:49:51.160
let's say light
trapping isn't perfect.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.780
We're at around 74%
efficiency of light trapping,

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.180
of absorption of light.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.200
Let's say now that we have
a thermalization event that

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.970
results in about a 33%
loss, so we're down to 67%

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.160
efficiency for the
thermalization of charge

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.536
carriers, just a step.

00:50:07.536 --> 00:50:08.910
So now our combined
efficiency is

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:12.280
going to be the multiplicative
product of those two.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.140
So just the thermalization
of charge carriers

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.410
results in a 33% drop
of an efficiency.

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:22.244
Now there's a delta between,
say, the band to band

00:50:22.244 --> 00:50:23.910
and the actual chemical
potential inside

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.360
of our material once we consider
the ensemble of carriers, not

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.651
just those free carriers,
but the ensemble of carriers,

00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:31.865
which is going to dictate
the ultimate potential.

00:50:31.865 --> 00:50:34.240
So we have some carriers that
are excited and others that

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.160
aren't.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.640
These thermodynamic losses
results in another 36% drop.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.570
And finally, fill
factor losses, which

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.830
represent the solar cell
and practical operation.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.470
When we have series resistance
and so forth, another 11%.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.570
So if we multiply these
four numbers together,

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.260
we drop down to 28.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.610
And the beauty of doing
breaking things out like this--

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.610
and what Peter Wurfel
does very nicely

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.180
is dives into each of
these in great detail

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.904
and explains to you exactly
how those numbers are derived.

00:51:03.904 --> 00:51:05.820
The beauty of doing
something like this is you

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.030
can pick the lowest
number, say, 64 and 67,

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.466
and say, I want
to work on those.

00:51:10.466 --> 00:51:12.590
I want to make my PhD thesis
about those parameters

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:14.340
because that has
the biggest impact.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:19.931
And that's what you can do
with an analysis like this.

00:51:19.931 --> 00:51:21.180
Now you can take this further.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.340
You can say, well,
these are only four

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.530
of the many parameters
that impact performance.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:30.700
I would like to look
at many, many more.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:36.200
And that's what one has done
for crystalline silicon, which

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.640
is arguably the most researched
and, from the point of view

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.240
of physical understanding,
advanced solar cell technology.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.819
We can see a variety of
performance loss mechanisms

00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:49.110
that have been taken into
account inside of the crystal

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.280
silicon devices.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.950
This was an invited
talk by Dick Swanson,

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.360
the founder of Sun Power,
former professor at Stanford,

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.115
who pulled this together,
a very nice presentation.

00:52:01.115 --> 00:52:03.740
He speaks with authority because
Sun Power produces the highest

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.360
efficiency crystalline silicon
solar cell device commercially.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.700
And interestingly,
right here, this

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.570
is the thermodynamic limit and
the calculated limit efficiency

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:17.610
versus time.

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:18.680
So we start from Prince.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.300
That was the very first one.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.940
And we have Shockley-Queisser
up there, and so forth.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.780
So the theoretical limit
of solar cell performance

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.510
has also changed with time.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.160
And their calculations vary.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.410
So it's important to be
able to understand this

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.800
as well as you go into it.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.800
And here is the actual best
laboratory performance.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.467
So if we had, for example, a
25% efficient cell over there,

00:52:42.467 --> 00:52:45.050
it would already be higher than
some of the earlier efficiency

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.890
calculations for
crystalline silicon.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.300
What Dick Swanson thinks is the
practical limit is right there.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.740
That's the Swanson
prediction, that we

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.820
won't get much above 26%
for crystalline silicon.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.890
So loss mechanisms
visualized right here,

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:04.910
and several good readings
on efficiency limits.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.110
What I'm going to
do is pause here.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.490
There is still some
material in your text,

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.740
and some really cool
demos that we're

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.560
going to have to wait
until next week to see.

WEBVTT

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:10.143
So is there any way to prove
that pidgins never existed,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.646
or can they only not
be proven to exist?

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.248
So actually, I
think this question

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.585
hinges on the way you def-- on
what you mean by pidgins, what

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.420
is meant by pidgins, right?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.789
So at least wanted
define pidgins,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359
which is to say that there are
these systems of communication

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.562
which are created when people
come from different language

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.231
background and they
have to communicate,

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.465
they have speak to each other.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.835
So like in Africa, in Asia--

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:40.006
in fact, this term pidgin
arose in the coast of China,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.076
and it referred to
this business language

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.047
that people used to cross
linguistic barriers.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.115
So from that
perspective, pidgins

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.519
do exist, right, if you
take it as that definition.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.722
Pidgins have been documented
over and over again.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.759
They are non-native languages,
and typically, they indeed

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.128
reduce in structure.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:06.132
But as people use
them more and more,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.967
they can develop structure.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:08.835
So-- go ahead.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.335
OK.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.337
AUDIENCE: I guess my
question be more like, if--

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.873
you were saying that there was
no pidgin of Haitian Creole?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.808
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Mm-hmm.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.410
AUDIENCE: Like, uh-huh, like--

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.777
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Right, so this is

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.448
where we need to be clear
about how we define pidgins,

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.951
because we looked at the
way Bickerton defined it.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.220
So the claim was
a very strong one,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.521
that in the history
of the Creole,

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.294
you have this earlier
speech system that's

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.563
extremely rich using
structure, and he

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.898
was very precise in
terms of what's missing.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.068
And what's missing is affixes--

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:47.006
so no bits of words that can
be used to create larger words.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:52.479
So we don't have things like
"-er" in English "singer."

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.214
So that's a very
extremely precise claims

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.683
that, according to
which pidgins are

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:02.021
supposed to be at the bottom
level of language complexity.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.024
They are really simplest
system impossible-- in fact,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.293
even un-language-like.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.531
They might remind us, say, of
the language of homo erectus.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.834
So that claim is a strong
one that we're looking at.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.903
So in the history
of Haitian Creole,

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.806
according to the
evidence that we have,

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.243
we don't see anything of
that sort that's documented.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.845
So the earliest
archival data source

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.116
that we have the
full-fledged language

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.685
with all the bells and
whistles, including

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:38.758
affixes, embedding, very complex
language from the very earliest

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.827
stages.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.629
You see?

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.598
But you seem to have
some doubts about--

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.133
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because--

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:51.671
I didn't write this question,
but I was still having--

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.873
like we can't know if there
was no recording of there

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:57.510
being a pidgin, but maybe
there was no recoding because--

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.946
like, if there is a recording,
we're like, OK, oh, then

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:00.780
a pidgin did exist.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.382
But just because
there's no recording,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.951
can we not say that, oh,
maybe there was a spoken one?

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.953
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Right,
but it was never--

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:12.492
yeah, I can see what
you're trying to drive at.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.961
AUDIENCE: Or if
somebody were to ask--

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.564
also, what was in between--
between the current Creole

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.465
and the different languages.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.970
If somebody-- how would I--
if somebody were to debate,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.639
it's like, oh, Creole's are--
then how should I respond?

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.340
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well,
you could say that--

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.008
OK, so actually, Bickerton
has used something

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.143
of that kind of argument.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.645
Well, the way he put it,
he put it very succinctly.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.982
He says that "the
absence of evidence

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.884
is not evidence of
absence," right,

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.420
which is exactly what
you're trying to claim here.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.789
The fellows would not have
that clear kind of data

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.691
is that evidence that
this doesn't exists.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.860
It might have existed, but
nobody recorded it, OK?

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.730
But in this scenario,
right, the claim

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.232
is stronger that--
you see something

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.101
like if it could have existed
and nobody could pay attention,

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:58.004
because it could have existed
and be part of a community

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:01.641
to the point, where children
being born in the community

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:06.112
would have used that evidence
to create the creole.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.949
Remember that this
is what you get.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.017
At some point-- let's see.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:15.521
Let's call it
generation, I don't

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.589
know-- let's call it zero.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.195
And for that generation,
all the hearing is--

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:25.031
I think I'm going to have
to use a stronger marker,

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.067
so Rachel could you help me?

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.402
Maybe this one, it might work.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.304
Let's see.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.272
This is from here.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.313
Oh, yeah. That's better.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:43.182
OK, so there would
have been enough

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:48.554
of this kind of data for these
children then to use that

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:52.025
and then, from that,
create the creole.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.460
So it's not as if that
this would have been a very

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.633
fleeting type of language, so
given that they were observers

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.902
of the speech patterns
of that period,

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:07.407
people wrote about the patterns
of the Africans, you see.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:13.112
It would have been surprising if
it was indeed a communal lingua

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.015
franca of sorts, and nobody
noticed that, whoa, there

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:20.019
was a system where all the
French suffixes were gone.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.389
What one could
imagine along the line

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.326
was that there might have
been some Africans who

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.696
will be producing something
that could be Pidgin-like,

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.332
which would be like a second
language version of French--

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.633
which is what we expect, right?

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.569
Because if you're
learning Italian,

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.038
you might go to a stage where
you produce Italian verbs

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.441
without affixes, right?

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.077
And from that perspective, yes,
one could imagine that there

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:49.449
would be some speakers
producing Pidgin-like data,

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.819
but could there be a whole
community that would be using

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.353
that Pidgin--

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.723
including, say, people in
their own homes to the point

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.858
where the children
would be only getting--

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.160
because remember
that for Bickerton,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.132
the crucial fifth piece is
that you have children here,

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.501
and the children are
transforming this Pidgin

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.602
into a Creole.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:12.438
And then you get, at
a later generation,

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:17.143
it's called this, I
don't know, plus one.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:22.281
Then you get the Creole
becoming a stable language

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.883
from the Pidgin.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.552
AUDIENCE: And too, like,
[INAUDIBLE] like tunneling

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.421
the people [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.022
Would it be done,
like, that people

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:32.492
were keeping their languages
while this was being developed

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.826
at the same time?

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:38.598
Or that how it would be-- is
that how it happened with like,

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:41.200
were people keeping
their African languages--

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.302
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah, in
fact, there is reports.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:44.871
So someone like
Toussaint L'Ouverture,

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.340
for example, the
well-known Haitian leader,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.144
was claimed to also speak
African languages from, say,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:55.481
the Bay family, so this is
likely that one could imagine

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.518
at some point there would be
many speakers in the community

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.922
who would be bilingual
or trilingual,

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.526
even speaking four
or five languages.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.394
But the question
here is whether there

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:11.264
was anything like
what Bickerton posits,

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.765
that was spoken
across the community

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.668
to the point where the children
had no choice but to use

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:19.338
only the speech and data to
create the native creole,

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.573
and the evidence is not there.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.809
And also, structurally--
and this is what we see.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.311
So maybe we should come
back to that question

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.913
when we look at the
data, because we're

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.148
going to come back to
the data that we have

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:31.517
and try to make
sense of this claim.

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.886
AUDIENCE: If you think about
the situation with Spanish--

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:36.155
or with Spanglish in
the US, it's very--

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:39.959
I mean, I would say that
there's several generations that

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.961
speak it.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.164
I also would say that it's
relatively unstable in the way

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.967
that a Pidgin might
be, but I also

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.602
wouldn't know what
the difference would

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.873
be between an unstable Pidgin
and code switching in the sense

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:58.444
that, like, if you think about
more of a modern day example,

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:02.148
I would say that Spanglish
is the best candidate,

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.150
but that also is my concern.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.318
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But again--
so that's a good point

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.519
that you're bringing up here.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.221
So the idea is that
would Spanglish be

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.890
anything like a Pidgin, right?

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.327
And first of all, I would
say that the conditions that

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.296
surrounds Spanglish are very
different from those that

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:20.733
surrounded, say, the
creation of Haitian creole,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:24.103
so in terms of just a mix, you
see-- so in Haitian creole,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.673
where we have lots of African
languages being spoken

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.876
and plus many
varieties of French.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.077
There wasn't just one French.

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:34.447
There were many languages
that were now called French,

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.381
but in fact they were
quite different in terms

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.451
of the structures-- what
the French themselves

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.087
called the Patois, right.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.121
AUDIENCE: I thought when
we talked about Pidgins,

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:46.659
we talked about Pidgins
as non-genetic languages,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.728
so then, if we're looking
at that definition,

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:53.366
then technically the only
Pidgins would be the very, very

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.700
first languages.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.436
So then you can't
have creole of Pidgin,

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:00.306
because it is influenced
or derived from something?

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.707
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Well, that's what

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.342
we're going to see exactly--

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:08.314
that in a way, there's a
sense in which by using that--

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.483
[INAUDIBLE] creoles
derive from Pidgin,

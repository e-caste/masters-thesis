00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:23.650
IAIN STEWART: So
last time, we were

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.260
talking about regularization
and power counting.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.928
And in particular, we were--

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.470
we argued that there
some things that

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.852
are nice about dimensional
regularization when you're

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:34.060
doing dimensional power
counting, which is what we've

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.800
been discussing so
far, power counting

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.470
and ratios of mass scales.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.810
So I want to continue
along that theme today,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.600
and in particular move
towards really talking

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.590
about matching calculations
in the context of mass

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560
of particles.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
So just continuing
with this discussion

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.470
of dimensional regularization,
we also have to pick a scheme.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.020
And the scheme that
is a nice scheme

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.275
for dimensional regularization
is this MS bar scheme.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.150
There are some things
that are good about it.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.580
Well, it's good because
it works under the context

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.295
of dimensional regularization
and preserves--

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.170
and it doesn't mess up
any of the nice things

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.130
about that regulator.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.770
So it preserves symmetries--

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.390
gauge, symmetry,
Lorentz symmetry,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.010
the things we
mentioned last time.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.070
In terms of doing
calculations, it

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.500
makes them technically
easy, or easier.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.618
So a lot of--

00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:33.160
if you look at the
literature and you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.840
look at multi-loop
calculations, they're

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.393
all done on the MS bar scheme.

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:38.560
And there's a reason for
that, because you've only--

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.300
you haven't introduced
these extra scales

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.138
that would make your loop
calculations more complicated.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.730
And finally, in the
context of our discussion

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.580
of effective field theory,
it's nice because it often

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.040
gives what I would call
manifest power counting,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.740
where we can power count
both the regulator diagrams,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.900
the renormalized diagrams.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.650
We don't have to worry
about whether we've

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.840
added the counter terms or not.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.887
We can just do power counting.

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:12.970
So if there's some good,
there should be some bad.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.810
So what's the bad?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.970
Nothing is free in life.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.707
So one thing that
we kind of lose

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:27.040
with dimensional regularization
is the physical picture.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.850
When we had this cutoff
that we introduced,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.920
or if we have a
Wilsonian picture,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.500
it's very clear what
you're doing as far

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.940
as removing degrees of freedom.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.640
And in MS bar, that's
a little less clear.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.220
So if it's just less
clear but it's still fine,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.140
that would be--

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.910
that would just be
a technical aspect

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.110
and we would just
pretty much ignore it.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.790
So what's one--

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.100
I'll give you one
example of something

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.560
in which the picture
being less clear

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.630
could actually mislead you.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.670
So if you calculate some
renormalized quantities

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.640
in MS bar, you could have
some a-priori knowledge

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.890
that these renormalized
quantities should be positive.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.682
Maybe they're supposed
to be kinetic energy

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:16.060
or some operator,
higher-dimension operator, that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.890
gives a kind of
higher-order kinetic energy

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.140
term, some kind of
physical intuition

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.950
that it should be positive.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.920
Well, that might not
be true in MS bar

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.530
because MS bar loses
this physical picture.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.350
You're removing just
the 1 over epsilons.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.790
You're not really having any
control over the constants,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.380
or the constants are
kind of predefined.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.610
If those constants are
kind of too negative,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.140
then you can end up with
renormalized matrix elements

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.560
in MS bar that
could be negative,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.470
your physical intuition tells
you they should be positive.

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.560
So that's something
to be aware of.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.310
Where a physical picture
could guide you and tell you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.310
what to expect, but you might
lose that by using MS bar.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.959
There's another thing
that's kind of technical

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.950
but is worth knowing.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.230
And we will talk about it
a little bit more later.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.330
You could ask the question,
is the Wilsonian picture

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.800
and the Wilsonian
scale separation

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.750
really equivalent to
the scale separation

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.300
that you do in dimensional
regularization?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.930
And the answer is,
almost but not quite.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.000
It certainly is for
all the log terms.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.932
And I mentioned last
time that the log terms

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:47.140
that we saw in the two ways
of doing the calculation,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.170
you could just see a direct
correspondence between them.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.410
But there's a leftover
residual effect

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.450
called renormalons that does
show up in the MS bar scheme

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.900
and is related to
power divergences.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.370
And so this effect
is carefully hidden.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.260
It's actually hidden
in the asymptotics

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.232
of the expansion in alpha s.

00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:12.940
And it goes under the
rubric of something

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.470
that people call renormalons.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.900
So there is a leftover
physical effect

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.710
from kind of having the
freedom to drop all the power

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.960
divergent terms.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.110
But it carefully hides
itself in a strange place

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.108
in the gauge theory.

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.650
And we'll talk more
about this later.

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:44.710
It's not so important if you're
working to order alpha s.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.340
But if you start working toward
alpha squared or higher, then--

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.950
or if you start going to higher
orders in perturbation theory,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.490
then this could come
in and be important.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.660
And it does come in in
QCD at fairly low orders.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.720
At order alpha squared, it
can cause numerical effects

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.810
if you ignore this.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.340
And there are ways of taking
it into account without losing

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.243
the nice things here.

00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:05.660
So we'll talk about
that later on.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.270
And then there's a final thing--

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.840
we had three good points, we
should have three bad points--

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.590
the final thing we'll
deal with right now.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.470
And that is the fact
that MS bar does not

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.050
satisfy something
that's a theorem called

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.130
the decoupling theorem.

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.040
So what is the
decoupling theorem?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.820
So this goes back to
Appelquist and Carrazone.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.258
And it says the following.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.520
So you're thinking about
an effective field theory,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.978
you're thinking about deriving
a low-energy effect of field

00:06:56.978 --> 00:07:00.295
theory by integrating out
some mass of particle.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.700
And the decoupling theorem
says that if the remaining

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:15.490
low-energy theory
is renormalizable,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:36.280
and we use a physical
renormalization scheme,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.890
then you kind of
get what expect,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:45.550
that all the effects
of the heavy particles

00:07:45.550 --> 00:08:07.374
turn up in couplings or
effects, they're suppressed.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.118
So this seems very
physical from what

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.410
we've described about what
effective field theories do.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.580
So in that sense, it's--

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.480
I'm not going to try to
prove it to you or anything,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.373
but there is this
caveat that you

00:08:25.373 --> 00:08:27.290
need to use a physical
renormalization scheme,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.490
of which MS bar is not one.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.120
So we decided that
we liked MS bar,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.190
but then we found some problems.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.960
And this problem here,
this last problem, we're

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.210
going to deal with right away.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.110
So MS bar is not physical.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.130
And hence, it doesn't
satisfy this theorem.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.110
It's mass-independent.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.760
And that is something
that we like,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.010
but it also is causing
exactly this problem.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.850
That's how it-- it's why
it violates the decoupling

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.370
theorem.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.770
Because it's
mass-independent, it

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.340
doesn't know enough
about the mass

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.802
to know that the effect
of massive particles

00:09:21.802 --> 00:09:22.760
should always decouple.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.220
So in MS bar, what
you have to do

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.290
is you have to implement
that decoupling by hand.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.250
And we've gotten actually
so used to this logic

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.220
that it's often even
not mentioned that this

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.250
is something that we're doing.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.990
So go over that a bit.

00:10:14.693 --> 00:10:16.360
So I'll just go over
this in the context

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.770
of a particular
example, which is

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.170
the most common
example, which is

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.520
QCD with massive
particles in MS bar.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.164
And I'll show you how it works.

00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:40.840
So QCD has a beta function
of the renormalized coupling

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.880
mu d by d mu of g of mu.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.587
And just to establish
some notation,

00:10:45.587 --> 00:10:48.170
I'm going to remind you of some
facts that you've seen before.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.610
So this is the beta
function at lowest order.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.600
I'll call this factor
that depends on the group

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:18.550
that you're dealing with and how
many light fermions you have,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.740
I'll call it b0.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.660
And this is less than 0.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.200
And this is only the
first-order term in a series,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.630
but it'll be enough for
our discussion right now.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.280
So this is g to the
fifth terms, et cetera.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.930
That's the beta function for g.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.270
We can also think about using--

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:45.720
since g likes to come squared,
we can switch to alpha.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.090
QCD is asymptotically free.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:12:00.845
When we solve this equation
for alpha, it looks as follows.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.715
And the coupling
constant decreases

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:15.840
as you go to higher energy.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:28.300
So this is alpha at md,
and this is alpha at mW.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.330
Alpha at mW is less
than alpha at md.

00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:34.275
This is the
lowest-order solution.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.520
So just a little bit more in
the way of setting the stage,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.790
you can also associate to this
solution here an intrinsic mass

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.360
scale dimensional transmutation.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.010
If you form the
combination mu exponential

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.420
of minus 2 pi over beta 0--

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:34.740
b0 alpha of mu, and you use
this equation over here,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.990
then what you'll find is
that this combination is also

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.860
equal to mu 0, same
thing alpha of mu 0.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.700
So it's independent of what
choice of scale you use, mu

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.770
or mu 0.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.520
Therefore, you define
it to be a constant,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.145
and that constant is
called lambda QCD.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.500
Once you do that, you can
also just take this equation

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:03.260
and write it like this.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.147
Write that, rewrite
that solution like this.

00:14:06.147 --> 00:14:07.980
So it's another way of
specifying a boundary

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.230
condition, if you like, for
the differential equation.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.590
One way is to pick a value
of the coupling somewhere,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.690
another way is to
fix this constant.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.850
So this guy is independent
of mu, as I said.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.503
And it's the scale where
QCD becomes nonperturbative.

00:14:39.948 --> 00:14:41.490
And the reason I
have to mention this

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.990
is because we're
going to be talking

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.610
about anomalous
dimensions, and I

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.977
have to tell you when the things
that I write down are valid.

00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:49.560
And it's all going
to be valid as long

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.770
as we're not near this scale.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.145
Because if we're
near this scale,

00:14:52.145 --> 00:14:53.700
the coupling gets
too large for us

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.220
to do the perturbation theory
that we're doing when we

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.100
calculate anomalous dimensions.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.980
So you can ask the question,
what does this thing depend on?

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.170
And if we look at the
right-hand side here,

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.140
we can already see some
things it depends on,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.560
because it depends on b0.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.960
And if we looked back at what
b0 is, b0 depended on the fact

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.175
that we were at su3 if it's QCD.

00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:17.175
It also depended on the
number of light flavors.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:30.180
So this scale that
you fix here, well, it

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.710
depends on the order
of the loop expansion.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.830
We wrote down a formula that
was valid at first order,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.838
but we could extend that formula
at higher orders as well.

00:15:40.838 --> 00:15:42.630
And the formula would
change, and the value

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.338
would change if we
went to higher orders.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.060
Depends on the number
of light flavors.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.290
And it actually also starts
to depend on the scheme

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.460
but only at two loops.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.580
So it'll depend on
MS bar versus MS,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.960
for example, but only
beyond two loops.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.740
Now, the issue with this is
that a priori, nothing tells us

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.720
whether if you have
a top quark or an up

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.450
quark or a bottom quark.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.610
In MS bar, nothing
a prior tells us

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.030
what to do with these formulas,
what to include in the b0.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.490
Just seems like we should
include everything that exists,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.701
all the known light fermions
that couple to the gauge field.

00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:30.050
But there might be some
we don't know about.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.830
Should we include those, too?

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.270
MS bar, with the logic
we've presented so far,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.770
doesn't tell us what to
include there in that nf.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.030
So let me phrase it this way.

00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:52.750
But the top quark
and the up quark,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.020
which have very different
masses, both contribute to b0.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.270
And it seems like they
do that for any mu.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.680
Even though-- even if I'm
at a very low-energy scale

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.110
and the top is
very heavy, MS bar

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.631
is not smart enough to
decouple the top quark.

00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:15.339
If you were to work
in a physical scheme,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.579
then this decoupling theorem
guarantees, actually,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.720
that the top quark
would decouple,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.990
and it would drop out of the
beta function in that scheme.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.099
But in this MS bar
scheme, it doesn't happen.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.070
So the solution to
this is to build back

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.290
in the thing that happened
in the physical schemes

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.740
into our MS bar scheme.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.480
And we do that by implementing
the decoupling by hand.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.330
And we just say that when
we get to a mass threshold,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.480
we're going to integrate out
the heavy fermion in this case.

00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:09.590
So at some scale of order
of the mass of that fermion,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.040
we're going to integrate
out the heavy fermion.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.350
And that's an example of
during matching, actually.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.950
You're moving from
one theory to another,

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.870
because you're changing
the field content.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.432
You're removing some
fields, and that's

00:18:27.432 --> 00:18:28.640
an example of doing matching.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.050
So what this means is that
we'll define different b0's

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.430
depending on what
scale we're at.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.380
So nf would be 6 if we're at
scales above the top quark.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.490
But then we drop
that nf down to 5

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:05.360
once we're below the top
quark mass, et cetera.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.920
So it's a discrete
jump in what the b0 is.

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:18.900
So in some sense,
what that means

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.680
is that this kind of matching
is forced upon you in order

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.230
to preserve physics in MS bar.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.930
If you were to do some other
scheme like a physical scheme,

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.180
it's not to say that you
couldn't take the same logic.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.790
You could do matching to
integrate our heavy particles

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.240
in those schemes as well.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.470
And in fact, some
sometimes people have.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.220
But in MS bar It's
really forced upon you.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.260
There's no way out,
because you otherwise

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.300
wouldn't get the physics right.

00:19:48.725 --> 00:19:49.850
So we've got to be careful.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.017
If you gain something,
sometimes you lose something.

00:19:52.017 --> 00:19:53.862
And if it's physics
that you're losing,

00:19:53.862 --> 00:19:55.070
you have to build it back in.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:19:59.550
OK.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.165
So how do we actually
do this matching?

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.790
Well, we use what are
called matching conditions.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.553
So what is a matching condition?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.370
At some scale which
I'll call mu m--

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.290
that could be equal to
m, but it could also

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:35.180
be equal to twice m or 1/2 m,
some scale that's of order m--

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.370
we're going to demand
something about the theory

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.210
above and below.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.660
And that is that S matrix
elements in the two theories

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.470
are going to agree.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.670
Of course, we should
be careful to make sure

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.842
that we work within
the realm of things

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.800
that we can calculate in
the low-energy theory.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.860
So we should consider
only S matrix elements

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.660
with light external particles.

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:09.500
If we're getting rid
of the heavy ones,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.208
we don't want them on
the external lines.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.700
So the basic idea is that we
set up matching conditions which

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.190
are conditions that say that
S matrix elements should agree

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:30.500
between theories 1 and 2,
what we called theories 1

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.270
and 2 last time.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.200
So if we do that
for QCD, the example

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.238
we've been talking about,
and we do it at lowest order,

00:21:42.238 --> 00:21:44.030
then the conditions
are actually very easy.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.210
So here's the picture.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:22:02.070
Let's imagine that the top quark
is here, bottom quark is here.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.310
My picture is not to scale.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.830
Charm quark, et cetera.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.630
Then what we do when we
want to say that the theory

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.320
above and below, that that
threshold is the same, if we

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.650
just match QCD above and below,
it just gives a continuity

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.150
condition on alpha.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.840
So let me write it
down at this scale.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.560
So here we would have alpha 6.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.570
Alpha depends on the
number of flavors.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.887
Here we have alpha 5.

00:22:40.887 --> 00:22:42.470
A different definition
of the coupling

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.012
a different number
of active flavors,

00:22:44.012 --> 00:22:45.620
a different value of b0.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.560
3.

00:22:54.417 --> 00:22:56.000
And what these arrows
are representing

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.600
are just kind of
renormalization group evolution,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.133
which I'll just call running.

00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:03.800
And then what the
lines are representing

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.120
is doing some matching.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.130
So every time we reach a
threshold, we do a matching,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.460
we switch the field
contact, and we

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.160
get a new effective field theory
with a new coupling constant.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.920
So the coupling just depends
on what theory content we have.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.440
And the matching condition
is, say, at this b quark scale

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.650
that alpha s at 5 at some
scale that's of order mb

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:40.190
is equal to alpha s at 4.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.340
That's the leading order
matching condition here.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.560
And similarly, the same
condition at all scales.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.620
And this is mu b,
just to be clear,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.860
is something that's of order
mb, could be equal to mb,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.830
could be equal to mb/2,
could be twice mb.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.830
And sometimes people use
these different choices

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.060
to get uncertainties.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:06.560
OK.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.018
So it seems fairly
straightforward,

00:24:08.018 --> 00:24:10.850
just continuity of the coupling.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.003
But that has some caveats.

00:24:13.003 --> 00:24:14.420
But go ahead and
ask the question.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.045
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:15.045 --> 00:24:18.270
So how do you know that
that's the physical observable

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.740
that you care about?

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.740
What if I was trying to measure
the [INAUDIBLE] alpha s?

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.370
IAIN STEWART: So this is the--

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:27.870
yeah.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.310
So if you're going--

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.218
so you have to think about it as
not the derivative of alpha s,

00:24:34.218 --> 00:24:36.510
but you have to think about
it as an S matrix element--

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.880
something two-to-two
scattering, right?

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.770
If you do two-to-two
scattering, then it's

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.500
just going to be
proportional to alpha of mu.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.870
But the mu dependence in
your leading order prediction

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.180
is not really fixed.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.930
You need to go to
higher order to do that.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.472
So if you're just
ensuring continuity

00:24:51.472 --> 00:24:54.210
at leading order of
S matrix elements,

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.925
then this is all you need.

00:24:56.925 --> 00:24:58.800
And if you want to
construct something that's

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.570
like a derivative
of alpha, you have

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.940
to think of the derivatives
of the S matrix.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.610
But you can't take
derivatives of mu,

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.470
because that's a
higher-order question.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.576
So this is all you
need at leading order.

00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:11.118
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:15.997
So maybe my derivative example
is [INAUDIBLE] necessarily know

00:25:15.997 --> 00:25:18.270
the alpha s, you'd get only--

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.570
IAIN STEWART: So in general--

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.070
right.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.700
AUDIENCE: --but I don't
necessarily know that--

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:21.930
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.250
No, in general, you have to--

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.110
this is like one
particular example.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.080
In general, you have to ensure
continuity of all S matrix

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.190
elements.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.275
And that will-- in
this case, we'll

00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:33.150
give you conditions also
and what's happening

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.240
with masses and stuff.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.650
So it's all the
parameters of the theory.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.350
There should be conditions
for all of them.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.650
AUDIENCE: I guess these
words seem more complicated

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.700
than just asking for [INAUDIBLE]
some different equation.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.200
Does it ever boil
down to anything--

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.760
do you ever have to do anything
more complicated than just

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.210
like--

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.600
IAIN STEWART: I'm just--

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:51.990
yeah, so--

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.960
AUDIENCE: --change the beta
function [INAUDIBLE] continuity

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.853
and--

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:56.895
IAIN STEWART: It's really--
it's not complicated.

00:25:56.895 --> 00:25:58.790
It's just continuity
of S matrix elements.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.380
But you have to just know that
it's S matrix elements and not

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.760
the Lagrangian.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.890
Because those are
two different things.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:10.150
So let me give you an example
why it's not the Lagrangian.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.090
So this kind of thing
seems simple, right?

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.750
Just say, well, the
Lagrangian is continuous.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.040
The alpha-- the g that
appears in the Lagrangian

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.700
is continuous.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.000
But that's not true once
you go to higher orders.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.190
That's only a leading
order statement.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.830
If I write down the analog
of this condition at higher

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.370
orders, it looks as follows.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.170
So the coupling is actually
not continuous at MC bar

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.460
at higher orders.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.940
So demanding continuity
of the S matrix elements

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.190
does not lead to
continuity of the coupling.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:53.450
And the matching condition at
some scale looks like this.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.525
So the words are carefully
crafted to be correct.

00:27:12.043 --> 00:27:13.710
And they sound a
little more complicated

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.500
than they need to be, because
I want them to be correct,

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.217
even if I want--

00:27:17.217 --> 00:27:19.800
even if I were to do matching
at higher orders in perturbation

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.300
theory.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.920
And it's really at this
alpha squared level

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.500
that you start to see things
a little more interesting.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.760
OK.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.718
So now we've gone two
others beyond what I just

00:27:52.718 --> 00:27:54.980
told you before.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.590
So continuity at lowest order--

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.460
at the next order, you
can retain continuity

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.377
as long as you pick the
particular point where

00:28:01.377 --> 00:28:02.655
mu b is equal to mb.

00:28:02.655 --> 00:28:04.530
And you'd have-- then
this log would go away,

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.547
and you'd still have continuity.

00:28:06.547 --> 00:28:08.880
But even that doesn't work
out once you go to one higher

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.297
order, there's this constant.

00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:12.630
You could get rid of the logs
by picking a scale choice,

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.005
but there's no
scale choice which

00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:19.660
will make it continuous once
you get to alpha squared

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.600
in this matching condition.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.530
So this is the condition that's
necessary to ensure continuity

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.060
of S matrix elements
once you get

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.210
to that level of
perturbation theory.

00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:38.050
OK, so that is why I
said S matrix and not

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.185
just continuity of couplings.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:43.102
AUDIENCE: So this condition
is for 2-by-2 scattering,

00:28:43.102 --> 00:28:44.560
And then you get
other conditions--

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.227
IAIN STEWART: This
is the only condition

00:28:46.227 --> 00:28:49.103
you need for all the S matrix--

00:28:49.103 --> 00:28:50.770
you can use different
S matrix elements,

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.940
and they'll lead to
the same condition.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.220
AUDIENCE: How did you--
where does it come from?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.095
IAIN STEWART: So this,
it comes from ensuring

00:28:57.095 --> 00:28:58.840
that I calculate S
matrix elements, say,

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.650
2-to-2 scattering, in the theory
with five flavors and four

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.096
flavors.

00:29:04.096 --> 00:29:05.320
AUDIENCE: At two loops?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.010
IAIN STEWART: And I demand
that-- yeah, up to two loops.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.730
So where would this
guy here come from?

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.910
This guy here would
come from the graph

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.850
with an explicit
b quark, which is

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.823
in the theory with the b quark
but not in the theory without.

00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:21.490
Once you get to this
level, then there's

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.200
more complicated diagrams.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.120
Just think of
generalizations of this.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.630
And they involve
constants as well as logs.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.170
This guy just involves a log.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.670
And really, what
you're ensuring is

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.100
that in the theory
with the b quark, which

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.700
is this five-flavor theory,
you get the same S matrix

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.250
elements as in the
theory with four flavors.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.253
Since the diagrams differ
in those two theories,

00:29:46.253 --> 00:29:47.920
they're kind of the
same at lowest order

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.180
because you're just
doing two graphs.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.263
But once you have the b
quark and it can go around

00:29:51.263 --> 00:29:55.840
in the loop, then they
differ, and the conditions

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.285
become more complicated.

00:30:00.523 --> 00:30:01.940
So any other
questions about that?

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.230
OK.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.930
So one other thing
that we see from this

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.550
is related to these logarithms.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.980
We also see from
these conditions

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.060
here that there is going to
be no large logarithms as

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:33.440
long as we pick the scale
where we do this matching to be

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.100
of order mb.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.440
So you don't want to pick
mu to be the gut scale

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.670
or something you want to pick
it to be some scale so mu

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:56.510
is equal to mu b,
which is of order mb.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.293
Because you don't
want, for example,

00:30:58.293 --> 00:30:59.960
to make this log so
large that it starts

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.608
to overcome the coupling.

00:31:02.608 --> 00:31:04.400
You want it to be--
you want this to really

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.050
be a perturbative
thing so it makes sense

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.175
to think about this, and
then this is a correction,

00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:11.950
and that's another correction.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.680
OK.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:18.200
So the general procedure
is the same idea.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.390
So if I just kind of adopt
a more general procedure

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.150
for massive
particles [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.150
a more general notation.

00:31:35.592 --> 00:31:37.425
So this is with any
operators and couplings.

00:31:37.425 --> 00:31:39.000
It doesn't have to
be gauge theory.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.650
And if we have a
hierarchy of particles--

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.310
let's say we have n of them--

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:06.220
when we want to pass from an
L1 to an L2, an L3, to an Ln--

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.890
and we're doing the same type
of thing we just did over there.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.620
So the steps are the following.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.970
Consider S matrix
elements in theory 1.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:25.290
Do so at a scale which I'll
call mu 1 that's of order m1,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.550
and match that onto in the same
way of assuring the continuity

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:33.600
and do-- using these matching
conditions, match that onto L2.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.480
So this is the
technical step by which

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.830
I said that you could do--

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.980
you could in a top-down
approach take theory 1

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.550
and determine the
parameters of theory 2.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.260
The matching conditions are
determining the parameters.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.460
Alpha s 4 is of parameter
of theory 2 to alpha s 5.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.860
This is theory 1.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.270
And we're just determining
what this alpha s 4 should be,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.103
and this is the condition
that relates them.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.620
So after you do
that step, if you

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.150
want to go through
this picture here,

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.090
or the analog of that picture
for this case over here,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.095
then you need to compute
the beta functions

00:33:14.095 --> 00:33:15.720
in anomalous dimensions
in this theory.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.390
So it's the theory that
doesn't have particle 1.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:37.080
And then you evolve/run
the couplings down,

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.420
which just means
using the evolution

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.302
equation for the couplings,
whatever they may be.

00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:45.510
So we had the evolution
equation for alpha S a minute

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.740
ago on the board.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.053
And I would just use that to
go from a scale of order mb

00:33:51.053 --> 00:33:52.220
down to a scale of order mc.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.550
And then I repeat.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.550
And this is the general
kind of paradigm

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.190
of matching and running that you
hear about in effective theory

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.790
all the time.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.554
So we just keep going.

00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:19.929
And at the end of the day,
we're going to stop somewhere.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:21.304
And the place
we're going to stop

00:34:21.304 --> 00:34:23.895
is the place we want to
do lower-energy physics.

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.520
So let's say we stop
at the n-th level,

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.060
since that's the
last level I wrote.

00:34:36.037 --> 00:34:38.120
So if you're interested
in dynamics at that scale,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.037
that's where you stop.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.170
And that's where you compute
your final matrix elements.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.179
So everything up
until that stage

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.440
is just to determine
the theory Ln

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.720
and what are the values of
decoupling in that theory--

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.140
determined from knowing
information at the high scale.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.730
Knowing information
in theory 1, how

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.010
do I propagate that
knowledge all the way down

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.630
to low energies
consistently without losing

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.987
information I need?

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:16.570
And then once I'm
at the lowest scale,

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:20.453
I just do my computations
of observables.

00:35:42.138 --> 00:35:42.638
Yeah.

00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:43.131
AUDIENCE: Professor.

00:35:43.131 --> 00:35:43.923
IAIN STEWART: Sure.

00:35:43.923 --> 00:35:47.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] mention at
the scale where the particle is

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.851
there--

00:35:48.851 --> 00:35:51.020
actually, I was a bit
confused because if we

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.470
write the full
theory, then, say,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.990
2-to-2 scattering
in that mass scale,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.090
isn't there any like [INAUDIBLE]
say resonance effect,

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.570
and then you want to
match that to a theory

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.240
without the particle?

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.680
I thought we should
match the s--

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.730
IAIN STEWART: So there
is no resonance effect.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.560
And the reason is because the
momentum on the external lines

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.850
that you're taking--

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.780
you're thinking of
it as small, right?

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.680
The scale is chosen
to be the mass

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.860
of the particle, the
cutoff, mu, the soft cutoff.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.520
But not the momentum
of the particles.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.926
Good question.

00:36:26.926 --> 00:36:28.315
Any other questions?

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.310
OK.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:38.080
So we're not really done
talking about subtleties here.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.120
And we're not really
done talking about some

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.280
of the key ideas that come
into these calculations.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.420
I've given you a very simple
example just the coupling.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.740
That's a little bit too simple.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.365
So I want to do
something a little more

00:36:52.365 --> 00:36:57.750
sophisticated but still
fairly simple and widely used.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.548
And that is in the
standard model just

00:36:59.548 --> 00:37:01.090
to take the heaviest
particles, which

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.750
are the top, the Higgs, the
W, and the Z, and remove them.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.100
So we'll spend a bit of
time talking about what

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.870
happens when you do that.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.650
That's not the only
thing you could do.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.355
And in particular, before people
do how heavy the Higgs was,

00:37:22.355 --> 00:37:23.980
you could think of
other possibilities.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.870
And before people knew
how heavy the top was,

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.988
people did think of
other possibilities.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:35.830
This is actually a reasonable
thing to do, though.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.930
let me give you one example
of another possibility.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.010
Or you could say the top is
heavier than the W and the Z,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.700
so why don't I do the
top first, and then

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.235
I'll just follow your
diagram over there.

00:37:48.235 --> 00:37:50.740
I erased it, but it'd
follow the picture.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.810
And then I'll do some
running in the theory

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.310
without the top
quark, and then I'll

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.530
get down to the W
and the Z scales,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.840
then I'll remove
the W and the Z.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.340
OK.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.530
That would be a
valid thing to do.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.530
But it introduces complications
that are actually not

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.250
worth the effort.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.900
And benefit is actually
not that great.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.155
So I want to emphasize that.

00:38:15.155 --> 00:38:17.530
When should you think of things
as being comparably heavy

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.840
versus when should you think
of things being hierarchically

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.340
heavy?

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.190
Well, one complication
of removing the top quark

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:32.200
is that it breaks su2
cross u1 gauge invariance,

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.480
because the top quark was
in a doublet with the b,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:44.140
and you're trying to keep the
b and remove the top, which

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.280
doesn't sound good.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.200
You're trying to keep the gauge
particles, the W and the Z,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.570
in your theory.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:53.260
So you should still have
that gauge symmetry, even

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.870
if it's spontaneously broken.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.410
But you're trying to remove
one member of a doublet.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.542
And that leads to
[INAUDIBLE] terms

00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:03.500
that you'd have to clue
to the effective theory

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.930
so you can deal with it.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.430
And it's just a
little bit annoying.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.110
But, you know, it's
something you can deal with.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.090
The real crux of the
matter is that if you

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.790
compare mZ over m
top, or mW over m top,

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.685
that's about a half.

00:39:23.685 --> 00:39:25.060
So if you think
about what you're

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.670
expanding in when you take
external particles that

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.690
have momentum of order mZ,
integrate out particles

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.840
of order mt, you're expanding
in a half, which is not such

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.933
a great expansion parameter.

00:39:36.933 --> 00:39:38.350
Usually in effective
field theory,

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.020
you want to expand in something
that's at least a third,

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.110
hopefully a quarter.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.960
And a tenth if you really
want to have a good expansion.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.530
So half is not really that good.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:57.590
So that's the real
reason not to do it.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.250
And you could ask, well, why
do we lose by not doing that?

00:40:10.265 --> 00:40:12.015
And that, of course,
is the real question.

00:40:19.332 --> 00:40:20.790
Well, you miss some
running, right?

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.990
Because you don't have a
theory that has no top quark

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.740
but still has a W and
a Z, and that theory

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.490
could have anomalous
dimensions, and you'd

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.970
miss any running in that theory.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.463
You're kind of collapsing two
of the lines in my picture

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:34.380
with the arrow between,
you're collapsing them

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.810
down to just a single line.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.998
So you're missing the running
that would go between mt to mW.

00:40:41.998 --> 00:40:44.040
Well, of course, that's
not a very big hierarchy,

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.730
and it's logs of two.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:50.840
And that's why we
don't care that much.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.945
What it boils down to is that
you're treating alpha s at mW.

00:40:55.945 --> 00:40:57.320
And if we want to
be generous, we

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.820
can say it's mW squared
over m top squared.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.620
So they're logs of four.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.525
But you're treating
this perturbatively.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.153
If you remove both the top
and the W at the same time,

00:41:11.153 --> 00:41:13.570
then this is going to show up
in your matching conditions,

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.925
and you're not thinking of
that is something as large.

00:41:15.925 --> 00:41:17.400
Thinking of it just as order 1.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.710
So that's the cost,
which is not a big cost.

00:41:28.607 --> 00:41:30.440
Especially when you
give, say, that the cost

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.140
of going the other way would
be expanding in the half.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.300
Better to take the
cost in the logarithms

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.105
than expansion in the half.

00:41:39.105 --> 00:41:40.480
So that's a general
kind of rule,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.860
that if you're thinking about
removing massive particles,

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.670
you should ask, how close
are they to each other?

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.170
Should I integrate out a slew
of them at the same time,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.170
or one at a time?

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.340
That'll depend on exactly
the scales in the problem.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.410
And there's-- and it means
you're organizing the theory

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.764
differently if you do it,
the two different approaches.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:06.860
All right.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.830
So we'll do an example of this.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.890
We'll take a very
simple example,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.050
although not completely trivial.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.500
So just b quarks changing
to charm quarks u bar and d.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.450
So on the standard model,
which is where we start,

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.020
let's say we have a W boson.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.750
We have an up quark
that's left-handed.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:46.810
We have a CKM matrix
connecting flavors together.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.040
And we have down quarks.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.470
So this is-- there's
a matrix space here

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.350
in the flavor, which includes
bottom charm up and down.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.987
And tree level matching is easy.

00:43:00.987 --> 00:43:03.070
And some of the complications
I want to talk about

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.210
will come into the loops.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.270
So let's first get
through the tree level

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.600
and set up some notation.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.940
And then we'll talk about
what happens with the loop.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:17.270
So tree level, this is the
diagram in the theory 1.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.510
Just calculate it at tree level.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.670
W propagator, unitary gauge.

00:43:46.578 --> 00:43:47.870
And then there's some spinners.

00:44:04.945 --> 00:44:06.150
So we have an antiquark.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.630
So we have a v spinner
for the antiquark.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.520
That's an up.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.860
Everything else is a u spinner.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.580
I've put in explicitly
the P lefts to denote

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.165
the fact that it's left-handed.

00:44:25.352 --> 00:44:27.310
So there's some momentum
in this diagram, which

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.750
is momentum transfer, which
is the be momentum minus the c

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:34.970
momentum and the kind
of obvious notation.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.850
And of course, by
momentum conservation,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:42.270
that's also the d momentum
plus the u momentum.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.260
And that's the momentum that's
going through the propagator.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.135
We're going to count momenta
as being of order masses.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.372
And the heaviest mass in this
case is the b quark mass.

00:44:54.372 --> 00:44:56.080
And we'll take it to
be the b quark mass.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.616
We can use the
equations of motion.

00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:06.330
So Pb slash on ub,
spinner for the b quark

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.350
is mb ub, et cetera.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.740
And we can simplify the
diagram by doing that.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.630
And of course, the
key thing is that we

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.000
can expand the propagator
since the momentum is smaller

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.050
than the mass of the
W for integrating out

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:32.680
the W. So the leading term
when we do that is this term.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:41.380
And any other terms that we
drop are down by that much.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.020
So for example, this
term here, we just

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.850
said that the k's are of
order mb so it's down.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.600
And then we could drop
the k squared here,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.530
I'll get the mW squared,
so we just have that.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.932
And then we put that together,
we can calculate the Feynman

00:45:55.932 --> 00:45:57.140
rule in the effective theory.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.160
The Feynman rule in
the effective theory,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.422
we can determine the
coefficient of it.

00:46:01.422 --> 00:46:02.880
So let's start out
with just saying

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.250
it's some four-quark operator
that couples together

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.490
those flavors, conveniently
chosen so that they're all

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.130
different to avoid
[INAUDIBLE] factors.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.240
And in some conventional
normalization

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.370
for this Wilson coefficient, we
call it GF, which is for Fermi.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.090
And the Feynman rule
would again give spinners,

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:33.360
the same spinners as before,
with the same Lagrangians

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.550
for these light quarks.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.780
Haven't changed
anything about that.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.405
We're just removing
the heavy particle.

00:46:43.627 --> 00:46:45.210
And it's conventional
also to pull out

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.850
the CKM factor [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:49.350
OK.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:52.237
So if you like, you can say
that there's a coefficient here,

00:46:52.237 --> 00:46:54.070
and that coefficient
has been fixed to be 1.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.860
And what this G Fermi
is, then, would just

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.180
be the leftover factors
of the gauge coupling

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.943
and the mass of the W. And
that's the usual convention.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:23.160
So G Fermi is just fixed in
this case, not as the thing that

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.927
is going to get corrected
at higher orders in QCD

00:47:27.927 --> 00:47:30.260
but would get corrected at
higher orders in electroweak,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.910
if you like.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.510
And then you sort of put
in with the QCD corrections

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.750
into some other coefficient
that we can call C.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.990
And we'll just say that
it's 1 at the level of this.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.640
And this line agrees with
the expansion of that line,

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.760
and that's the
matching of something

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.727
that's measurable, which is
this four-point function.

00:47:50.727 --> 00:47:52.310
So we can call it
an S matrix element.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.010
So this theory is very popular.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.220
It's called the
electroweak Hamiltonian.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.440
It's used all over the place.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.410
And it involves more than
just doing what I did,

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.145
because I chose a
particular set of flavors

00:48:20.145 --> 00:48:21.520
for a particular
channel, and you

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.183
have to do it for the whole--

00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:24.850
for all sorts of other
channels as well.

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.410
So we'll study some
aspects of this theory.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.150
We won't study every
possible aspect.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.000
But I've given you a handout
that studies a lot more.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.490
It's 250 pages long.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.510
I'm not asking you to
even read all of that.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.003
I've pointed you at
some pages of that

00:48:44.003 --> 00:48:46.170
in the reading, which are
relevant to the discussion

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.330
we're having here.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.080
If you really want to
dig deeper, you can.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.020
So people often call this an
electroweak Hamiltonian, which

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.120
is just minus the Lagrangian.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.860
So then that's 4 GF over 2.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.940
And as a Hamiltonian, we write
fields instead of spinners.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.320
So we have this
four-quark operator.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.890
And we would have determined
the Hamiltonian from tree level

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.430
matching, from what we've done.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:29.460
And this would be the
result. Standard stuff.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.080
How do we want to go
further than that?

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.975
Well, if we want to think about
theory 2, which is this theory,

00:49:39.975 --> 00:49:41.850
and we want to think
about it in more detail,

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.597
we should worry
about whether we're--

00:49:43.597 --> 00:49:45.180
with just this
operator, whether we've

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.033
got a complete set of structures
that could possibly occur.

00:49:50.033 --> 00:49:51.700
So we should think
about the symmetries.

00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:56.850
And it's useful to, therefore,
construct the most general

00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:04.018
basis of operators in theory 2.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.400
And we'll just do that.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.460
So if you read this
250-page review,

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.178
then it's done for the full
electroweak Hamiltonian,

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:15.720
and we'll just stick
with the flavors

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.660
we're talking about here.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.220
So what are the most
general bases of operators?

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.670
How should we think about that?

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.170
Well, we're
constructing some theory

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:31.630
that's going to-- that we're
matching onto it mu equals mW.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.800
And at that scale, when
we're determining the theory

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.758
and determining the
coefficients of the theory,

00:50:35.758 --> 00:50:38.900
we can treat the bottom
the charm the down

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.740
and the up respectively
as if they're massless.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:50.960
And really, what I mean by that
is that the masses of these

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.990
particles are only going to
show up in the operators and not

00:50:53.990 --> 00:51:00.630
in the coefficients,
which I've--

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.598
you see that I talked
about over here.

00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:05.390
The thing that shows
up in the coefficients

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.848
are the mass scales
we're removing.

00:51:06.848 --> 00:51:11.150
And we're not removing the
mass scales of these things.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.420
So that means, if we can
think of them as massless,

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.420
that we can think about the
matching in terms of using

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.680
something like chirality.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.600
And we can use the fact
that QCD for massless quarks

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.038
does not change chirality.

00:51:26.038 --> 00:51:27.955
And we can use that in
constructing our basis.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:38.580
So that means even though the
b quark and the charm quark

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.710
really have masses, for
the purpose of constructing

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.710
the operator basis, we can
think of them as massless.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:45.970
And we only have left-handed
guys to worry about here.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.070
Chirality means more than that.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.850
It also-- well, it
means effectively that.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:57.240
But it means also that we will
only get one gamma matrix here.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.940
And we can think
about why that is.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:04.190
Chirality means that
you get an odd number.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:08.550
You need an odd number to
have left on both sides.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:10.010
But you can reduce 3 to 1.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.660
So there's an identity which
I won't write out for you,

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:28.830
but you can reduce
3 back down to 1.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.780
So any higher odd number can
be reduced back down to 1.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:37.920
So once we use
chirality and that fact,

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.660
then we have a fairly
restrictive basis

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.435
in terms of Dirac structures.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.610
You could ask, what are the
most general possible ways

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.738
of contracting spinner indices?

00:52:59.738 --> 00:53:02.280
Who said I had to put this charm
quirk with the bottom quark?

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.190
I could have put the
up quark over here.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.955
And maybe in higher
orders that happens.

00:53:06.955 --> 00:53:08.330
Well, at higher
orders, you could

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.455
think about that happening.

00:53:09.455 --> 00:53:11.450
But you can always
get back to the form

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.700
that I wrote over there using
what's called the spin Fierz.

00:53:20.385 --> 00:53:25.430
So if I write it
for fields, it means

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.760
that there's an identity
that I can rearrange

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.910
this guy the other way.

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.420
And so these are
equivalent operators.

00:53:39.223 --> 00:53:41.140
And sometimes, you have
to use these relations

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.820
when you're doing
matching calculations,

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.908
because you construct
a complete basis, which

00:53:44.908 --> 00:53:45.700
is the minimal one.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.530
And then maybe when you
do your calculation,

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:48.947
you get this
operator, so you have

00:53:48.947 --> 00:53:52.000
to turn it back into this one.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.060
There's two minus
signs in this relation.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.163
One is from the Fierz
identity, and one

00:53:58.163 --> 00:53:59.830
is because when you
do the manipulations

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.288
you end up
anticommuting to fields.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.102
So from the statistics.

00:54:10.102 --> 00:54:12.310
So if you were to use the
same relation for spinners,

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.800
then there would be
one less minus sign.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.050
Something to be careful, though.

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:21.100
So what this tells you, once you
put that information together,

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:27.580
is that you know that you can
write the operators this way,

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.430
and you also know that
this gamma, capital gamma,

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:36.860
has that gamma u p left form in
terms of the Dirac structure.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:41.380
So the only really thing
that can happen is color.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.937
And you can contract
the color of these 3's--

00:54:43.937 --> 00:54:46.270
so you have four 3's, you can
contract the color of them

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:47.710
in different ways.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:49.780
Well, I have two 3
bars and two 3's.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.450
Think about having different
color contractions.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.310
And that will expand
our operator basis

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.160
by one more operator.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.750
There is also a color Fierz.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.870
And I can use that color Fierz
to get rid of having explicit

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.870
TA's.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.100
So color is a lot
like spin in the sense

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.650
that if I had more
TA's, then I can always

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:15.440
reduce a higher number of TA's
back down to a lower number.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.770
So I've had two, I can reduce
it down to one or zero.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:19.270
OK.

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.478
So I only really have to
think about having a TA here

00:55:21.478 --> 00:55:23.470
and a TA there.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.290
If I have a TA there and a
TA there, there's a spinner--

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:30.270
or there's a color Fierz
relation for this guy

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.280
that you could use.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.062
And there's a
handout that I posted

00:55:35.062 --> 00:55:37.270
on the web that has a summary
of all these relations.

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:42.020
I'm not going to bother writing
them down in lecture here.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:47.030
So once I take
that into account,

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.090
then it ends up
in two operators.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:55.920
And if I were to write them in
a kind of renormalized notation

00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.460
where I introduce
the scale mu, then I

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.767
would write them as follows.

00:56:02.767 --> 00:56:03.850
Let's call them O1 and O2.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:11.650
And the difference between O1
and O2 is just simply color.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:14.860
So in O1, the color
index alpha is

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.150
contracted between charm
bottom and up down and up.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.370
And then in O2
it's the the colors

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.880
contracted the other way.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.490
So I don't write
explicit TA's, but I

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:33.620
do have to consider the other
possible way of contracting

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.120
the indices.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.400
Up, down, doesn't matter.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:50.900
OK.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:54.085
So these operators, these are
the two operators they have

00:56:54.085 --> 00:56:55.460
once I satisfy
all the symmetries

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.130
and I have some coefficients.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.080
And if you ask really what
the coefficients can depend

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.690
on here, well, they can
depend on mass scales like top

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.920
and the other particles
that I'm integrating out,

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.427
Z. I'm not going to make
that explicit in my notation.

00:57:14.427 --> 00:57:16.010
If I tried to make
every possible mass

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.900
scale like the Higgs or the
top, it would just be too much.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.820
So let me just denote two
things that it can depend on.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.940
Mu over mW can show
up, and alpha of mu

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.502
can show up, as well as some
ratios of other particles

00:57:29.502 --> 00:57:30.460
which we will suppress.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.060
So then what tree level
matching is saying

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.810
is that you've got one
of these operators,

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:50.790
and you didn't
get the other one.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:55.235
So it says that at tree
level, what we did before--

00:57:57.845 --> 00:57:59.840
and so say we do
matching at mu equals

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:11.860
mW and C1 at 1, which is mu over
mW equals 1 and alpha mW is 1.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.630
And then corrections to
that would be suppressed,

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:17.070
no large logs, just by alpha.

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:27.770
And C2 of 1 alpha mW is 0
plus something of this order.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:32.300
So that's what we determined by
doing our tree level matching.

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.600
Now, when we did our tree level
matching we did something.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.472
We used external states
which were quarks.

00:58:40.472 --> 00:58:44.190
We matched up the S matrix
elements in that way.

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:46.065
If you were really
interested in this process

00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:48.433
b goes to c u bar
d, you'd not really

00:58:48.433 --> 00:58:49.850
be interested in
measuring quarks.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.050
We don't see them.

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:53.890
You'd be interested in thinking
about the process for mesons--

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:58.365
B meson changes to a D meson,
and a pion, for example.

00:58:58.365 --> 00:59:00.740
And who's to say that the
matching that we did for quarks

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.760
is also the matching
that's valid for hadrons?

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.420
Well, it is.

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.760
So there's a key fact about
matching which is important.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.470
One of the things I
wanted to emphasize to you

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:18.050
is that it doesn't depend
on what states you pick.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.790
It's independent of
the choice of states.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.340
And it's independent of the
IR regulators that you pick.

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.560
So when you do
matching, you often

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.165
pick some IR regulators to
regulate IR divergences.

00:59:38.165 --> 00:59:39.540
And the only thing
you have to do

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.482
is pick the same states
and same IR regulators

00:59:41.482 --> 00:59:42.315
in the two theories.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.638
And once you do that, your
results for your coefficients

00:59:48.638 --> 00:59:50.430
will be independent of
the choice you made.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.680
So this is intuitively something
I think that's, once you

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.110
think about it, fairly obvious.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.030
What this sentence is saying
is that the matching, which

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.280
is supposed to be a
high-energy property,

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.465
is independent of the
low-energy physics.

01:00:15.465 --> 01:00:17.840
The choice of the states and
the choice of IR regulators,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.530
that's parameterizing something
about low-energy physics--

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.780
lower energy than the scale
we're trying to determine.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.700
These things should only depend
on higher-energy physics.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.365
So the outcome for them will
be independent of this choice.

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:49.670
So just to emphasize, even
when we use hadronic states,

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:57.290
the result that we obtain
from quark states is valid.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.092
That's just different
choice of state.

01:01:06.092 --> 01:01:08.300
And what we're doing when
we do the matching is we're

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.560
picking a convenient choice
of state, something that

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.378
makes it easy to calculate.

01:01:15.378 --> 01:01:17.670
If we tried to calculate the
matrix elements of B and D

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.100
and pi mesons, then I'm saying
if you're a strong enough,

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.188
you'd get the same
matching coefficient.

01:01:22.188 --> 01:01:23.730
Of course, you should
pick the result

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:25.320
that makes the
calculation easy, and that

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.280
would be to use quarks.

01:01:28.808 --> 01:01:29.850
Any questions about that?

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.240
OK.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.400
So this is something that
you should keep in mind.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.280
And you should keep
in mind that it is--

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.900
you do have to make
sure that you're

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.110
using the same states and IR
regulator in the two theories.

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:44.920
In this case,
that's pretty easy.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.330
The states are really the
same states, because you're

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.330
defining the states with
the Lagrangian machine

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.610
for the b quarks, say,
and the b quark Lagrangian

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:53.950
hasn't really changed.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:56.460
So there's no
change in the state.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.710
And you can set things up
so that you have the same IR

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:59.730
regulator.

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.650
And that'll become
important in the example

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:04.270
that we're just about to do.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:08.280
So let's do an example
of carrying out

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.970
this matching for C1 and
C2 in a little more detail.

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.810
And before we
carry out matching,

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:19.462
we actually have to
renormalize the two theories.

01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:21.420
Well, we've been talking
as if the theory above

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.820
is the standard model.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.823
So imagine that we've
already renormalized that.

01:02:25.823 --> 01:02:27.240
And so we only
have to renormalize

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.640
the effective theory in MS bar.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:37.080
So we'll talk about doing that,
remind you of doing that--

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.660
maybe something
you've seen before.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.945
So there's going to be wave
function renormalization.

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.780
So you have this 4/3.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:01.390
I'm going to leave out the
prefactor, this prefactor.

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:02.770
It's always going to be there.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.020
I'm going to stop
writing it and start just

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.890
focusing on the thing
in square brackets here.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:14.267
We'll do calculations
with Feynman gauge.

01:03:14.267 --> 01:03:16.100
I'm not going to really
do the calculations.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.640
I'm just going to
quote results to you.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:31.150
And in order to simplify
what we have to write down,

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.880
let me define the
set of spinners

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.860
that you get from taking the
tree level matrix element of O1

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.850
to be S1 and of O2 to be S2.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.970
So this is just the
spinners that we

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:51.370
wrote down before
for the case of S1,

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.465
exactly what we had before.

01:03:53.465 --> 01:03:56.090
And then for S2, just a slightly
different contraction of color

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:56.590
indices.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.200
OK.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.633
So that's just trying to
make the lowest-error result

01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:13.550
simple to write down so
that when I write down

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.440
the higher-error result, we
can focus on the things that

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.290
are changing and mattering, and
not on the complications that

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:21.210
come in from what
we're talking about.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:23.120
So if we think
about diagrams here,

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.530
we have four-quark operator.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:39.160
And we just have to draw
all the loop graphs Right.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.780
We have to regulate
them in some way,

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.380
because they are IR divergent.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.795
So let's regulate them with--

01:04:45.795 --> 01:04:47.920
if we really want to talk
about the matching, which

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.545
is what I really want
to do eventually,

01:04:49.545 --> 01:04:51.280
we should regulate
them in some way.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.130
And so let's regulate them
with off-shell momenta

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:55.480
on the external lines.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:00.117
And I'll take it to be a
common off-shell momenta p.

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:02.200
And I'll just set the
masses of the external lines

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.040
to 0, since they're
not going to matter.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.460
OK.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.590
So then what does it look like?

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:14.660
So the matrix element of O1--

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.940
the 0 means Bayer--

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.080
is going to have divergences.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:38.098
And it has the following
structure, times spinner 1.

01:05:38.098 --> 01:05:40.390
And then there's another
piece that involves spinner 1.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:06:00.230
And then there's a piece that
involves spinner 2 that shows

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:03.170
up in from these loop graphs.

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.840
So even though we're calculating
the Bayer matrix [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.690
of operator 1, the
spinner combination 2

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:13.010
shows up, because this
is supposedly a gluon,

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.050
and the gluon moves
the color around.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.968
And I'm only writing
the divergent terms,

01:06:21.968 --> 01:06:23.510
although later on
we'll be interested

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:24.760
in the constant terms as well.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.320
So the dots are the constant
terms underneath logarithms,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.830
and all these little
round brackets

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.202
have constant terms in them.

01:06:37.803 --> 01:06:39.220
Part of the reason
for introducing

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.320
the basis in the way
I did is that when

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.680
I want to quote you
the result for O2,

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.360
it's the same, just
switching 1 and 2.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.380
And so the statement that
you would have from this--

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.820
these are ultraviolet
divergences,

01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.598
the infrared divergences
are regulated.

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:01.390
The statement that you
would have from this

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.320
is that you can look at these
various terms, and you can ask,

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.210
what's going on with
those divergences?

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.300
Well, this one here is actually
cancelled by wave function

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:16.030
renormalization, which
I haven't put in yet.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.670
And this one here is
O1 mixing into O1.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.800
So this one here is a
counterterm, if you like,

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.920
for O1.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:41.070
And this one here is
a counterterm for O2.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:44.160
And the language you use as
you say that O1, which we're

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.600
calculating, has mixed into O2.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.910
So there's two
different methods we

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:09.810
could use to carry out
the renormalization here

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.858
that are actually equivalent.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:24.550
So method one is called
composite operator

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:25.860
renormalization.

01:08:33.038 --> 01:08:35.080
It's useful to know what
things are equivalent so

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.140
that you know what you can
get away with ignoring.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.790
So what is composite
operator renormalization?

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.189
Well, you think about
having a Bayer operator.

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:49.431
And you need to introduce
some constants to renormalize.

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:54.700
These are not related to wave
function renormalization.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.859
It's actually operator
renormalization.

01:08:56.859 --> 01:08:59.263
You have multiple fields at
the same spacetime point,

01:08:59.263 --> 01:09:01.180
you need additional
renormalization constants,

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.263
that's what these Z's are.

01:09:05.255 --> 01:09:06.880
When you go to take
the matrix element,

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.830
you have to include the wave
function renormalization

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:09.350
as well.

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:17.760
So the Bayer matrix element has
a wave function renormalization

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.029
as well as this Z. And
this is the relation

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:26.370
between the renormalized matrix
element and the Bayer one.

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:33.270
So this guy here is
renormalized and amputated.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.010
OK.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.759
So that's the relation
you can calculate O0.

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.330
That's what we were doing.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:47.109
We just calculated O0.

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:48.223
We could remove Z psi.

01:09:48.223 --> 01:09:49.890
And I just told you
if you remove Z psi,

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:51.399
it's going to get rid of this.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.732
And then you use the remainder
of this stuff to get Zij.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.570
I'm going to need it
the other way around.

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:14.445
So let me write the--

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.502
so I can write this relation
the other way around.

01:10:21.502 --> 01:10:22.880
And then it looks like this.

01:10:26.512 --> 01:10:27.920
OK, so that's one method.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.360
The other one is related
more to how we usually

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.640
think about things in
terms of gauge theory.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.700
And that is to have
counterterm coefficients

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.480
for the various operators.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:48.290
So start with the Hamiltonian
written in terms of Bayer

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:54.560
coefficients and operators
that have Bayer fields--

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.080
Bayer operators, if you like.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.540
And now switch over to
renormalized quantities,

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.230
so you get Z psi squared.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:07.533
We have to switch over
from the Bayer coefficient

01:11:07.533 --> 01:11:08.450
to a renormalized one.

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:10.370
So let me do that first.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.510
So we get some Z
for the coefficient,

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:16.540
some renormalized coefficients.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.370
And then we get a Z psi squared
from the four fermions that

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.170
are in this operator.

01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:26.440
Then we get an O.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:35.200
And then we can write this
in terms of Ci Oi plus Z psi

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:44.863
squared Zij C minus
delta ij Cj Oi.

01:11:44.863 --> 01:11:46.530
And then this would
be our counterterms.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:53.670
So we would stick in
this guy, that operator

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.110
we haven't renormalized--
we haven't done our operator

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:57.000
renormalization.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.583
We're not doing method 1.

01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:00.750
So this, the matrix element
here will still diverge,

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.981
but we cancel them off
with the counterterms.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:09.310
So that's the logic of method 2.

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:11.380
And once you do
that, the divergences

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:17.410
cancel between these two terms,
and you're left, if you like--

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.090
or even if you don't--

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:21.090
with the coefficients
times the operators, which

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:25.125
are renormalized,
both renormalized,

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:28.455
even renormalized separately.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.765
And these two are equivalent.

01:12:35.765 --> 01:12:38.627
These are equivalent ways of
thinking about the same thing.

01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:41.210
And we can even go further and
derive the equivalence of them.

01:12:44.547 --> 01:12:46.880
So if we take this theory and
we take the matrix element

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.380
of the Hamiltonian in this
second way of doing things,

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.070
what do we get?

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.860
We get this.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.620
So even though as Oi,
I said, we haven't

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.540
done operator
renormalization, so we still

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:12.780
have the divergences
there, that's Cj Oj.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.260
And if we write the
OJ using the relation

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:22.010
at the top of the board,
then we get Cj Zji inverse Z

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:27.388
psi squared Oi 0.

01:13:27.388 --> 01:13:29.180
And then we can just
look at the two sides.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.070
They both have
the Z psi squared.

01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:33.590
They both have a Cj,
they both have Oi 0.

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:38.400
The only thing that's
different is this.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.440
So we find the Zij
for the coefficient

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.410
is the transpose of the inverse
of the Z's for the operators.

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:51.420
So that's a more definite
way of saying the two would

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.462
lead to the same results.

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:53.878
And this is how
you would actually

01:13:53.878 --> 01:13:56.050
get the relation between
the two ways of doing it.

01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:02.420
So it's not completely trivial.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.430
You have to know you have to
take the inverse and transpose.

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:09.290
But it's the same information.

01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.790
OK.

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:19.950
So in our example,
the Z is a matrix.

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:22.950
It starts out as
the unit matrix.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:28.270
And in MS bar, we collect
the divergences that are not

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.437
cancelled by wave
function renormalization.

01:14:32.437 --> 01:14:34.270
And that gives us this
little 2-by-2 matrix.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.660
And from that little
2-by-2 matrix,

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.051
we can construct anomalous
dimension for the operators.

01:15:02.051 --> 01:15:02.830
So let's do that.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.360
So how do we do that?

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.250
Well, if we take the
renormalization of the Bayer

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:21.130
operators, remember those
dependent on the regulator,

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.260
but they didn't depend
on the scale mu.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.450
So if we take mu
d by d mu of Oi 0,

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.770
which is the Bayer
operator at 0.

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:30.560
That's what I've written.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.550
And then we can write
O in terms of the Z,

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:36.690
in the equation I raised.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:40.040
And both Z and the
renormalized operator

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.157
depend on the scale mu.

01:15:42.157 --> 01:15:43.615
And so that gives
us this equation.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.490
So I'm doing method
1 here, if you like,

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:56.650
using the notations
from method 1.

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:02.770
If I take that equation
and rearrange it,

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:04.330
I can write it as
anomalous dimension

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:05.720
equation for the operator.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.830
So it's mu d by d mu
is one of the terms.

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:11.230
I isolate this, and I
move that over by taking

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.400
an inverse of it.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.540
And I just call
everything that I

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.288
get there the anomalous
dimension of the operator.

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:33.215
So gamma ji is all the
other stuff, Zjk inverse.

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:45.050
And I put the explicit
minus sign here

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:46.800
so there's no minus
sign in that equation.

01:16:50.095 --> 01:16:52.220
Anomalous dimension is
determined by the Z factors.

01:16:54.952 --> 01:16:56.660
And we determine the
Z factors, and which

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.660
we can stick this equation
into that equation

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.319
and get the anomalous dimension.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.900
When we do that, we have to
be careful about the fact

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.355
that alpha s in d dimensions
has a little extra piece that's

01:17:18.355 --> 01:17:20.230
actually important for
this discussion, which

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:22.870
is this piece.

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:26.645
So when we take mu d by d mu,
you ask, what depends on mu?

01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:29.190
And it's the alpha here
that depends on mu.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:30.960
And it's still in--

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.180
depends on epsilon as
well in that equation.

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:37.320
And so this term is the term
that matters at one loop.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.390
And this matters at two
loops, and so does that.

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:47.610
But at one loop, we could just
replace this by the identity,

01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:48.630
and we can drop this.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.920
OK.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.280
Put those things together.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.730
Anomalous dimension,
of course, is something

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:05.610
that doesn't depend on epsilon.

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:07.545
And it's, in this
case, a 2-by-2 matrix.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.657
And we can solve this problem.

01:18:21.657 --> 01:18:23.865
If we want to solve this
matrix, then what do you do?

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.660
Well, you could diagonalize it.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.920
That's how you would solve it.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.420
So if you want to run the
operators in this theory just

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:44.220
for completeness,
you would diagonalize

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:49.120
by forming O1 plus or minus O2,
call the coefficients of those

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.715
new operators, C plus or
minus, and an obvious notation.

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.830
And when you write down
an anomalous dimension

01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:01.020
equations for
these guys, there's

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.720
no mixing anymore at one loop.

01:19:05.855 --> 01:19:07.230
In general, this
is the procedure

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:08.855
if you do this
diagonalization that you

01:19:08.855 --> 01:19:12.210
have to carry out again
when you get to two loops.

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.550
It's not like the basis
that you pick at one loop

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:17.698
will be fine for two loops.

01:19:17.698 --> 01:19:18.490
We're not so lucky.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:27.435
But at one loop, this is
a perfectly valid basis

01:19:27.435 --> 01:19:28.430
for the problem.

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.870
And in an hopefully
self-evident notation,

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.580
I either take all
pluses or all minuses.

01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:58.880
OK.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.470
And if I write my
Hamiltonian, I could write it

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:05.500
in the original basis.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.810
Then if I switch
to the other basis,

01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:12.110
I'll set up my convention
so that it's simple.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:15.190
And that means I
picked C plus or minus

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:18.334
to be C1 plus or minus C2/2.

01:20:18.334 --> 01:20:21.707
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] minus?

01:20:21.707 --> 01:20:23.040
IAIN STEWART: Whoops, thank you.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.430
Yeah, they have
the opposite sign.

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:36.980
First one's positive,
second one's negative.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:42.180
And in this new basis
tree level matching,

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:48.970
which is your boundary
condition for your revolution,

01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:50.830
is that both
coefficients are 1/2.

01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:55.470
OK.

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:59.370
So then we could solve
the differential equation

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.990
the same way we
were doing for QCD--

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.810
write down a result
that would sum

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:05.540
logs below the
scale of the W mass.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.590
OK.

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:14.860
So we'll continue along
these lines next time,

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:17.092
say a few more words
about renormalization,

01:21:17.092 --> 01:21:19.300
which is really just a
lead-up of doing the matching,

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.810
which is what I want to--

01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:23.360
kind of the thing I want to
spend a little more time on.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.995
So we'll finish that
up also next time

01:21:25.995 --> 01:21:29.400
and move on to
some other things.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.900
So there's a few
things to emphasize

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:31.710
when we do the matching.

01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:33.543
And I want to write
down the matrix elements

01:21:33.543 --> 01:21:36.020
and the full theory,
which are box diagrams,

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.143
I'll write down the
results for those.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:39.560
We'll compare those
to the results

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.977
of the effective
theory, and we'll

01:21:40.977 --> 01:21:42.195
draw some lessons from that.

01:21:42.195 --> 01:21:43.570
And we'll carry
out the matching,

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:48.690
figure out what the next order
coefficients would be here.

01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:51.535
What would those
alpha s terms be?

01:21:51.535 --> 01:21:53.430
What's the procedure
I would go through

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.440
to get those coefficients?

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:55.940
OK.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.340
So we'll stop there for today.

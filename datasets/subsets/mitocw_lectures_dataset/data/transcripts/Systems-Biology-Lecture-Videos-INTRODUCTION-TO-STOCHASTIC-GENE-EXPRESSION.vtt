00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.710
PROFESSOR: Today, as I mentioned
to you in last lecture,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.640
we're going to really be
focusing in quite some depth

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.370
into this paper by Sunney Xie.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.940
So I would say that it is one
of my all time favorite papers.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.490
And in particular
from the standpoint

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.380
of discussing a
paper in class, I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190
think it is
absolutely wonderful.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.140
It is, I think, clearly written.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.270
It explains why that
did all these things.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.130
And they checked all
sorts of possible sources

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.390
of perhaps being lead astray.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.130
And I think it was a
huge amount of work,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.410
and it was a technical tour
de force when it came out.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.450
So before this, I would say
single molecule biophysics,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.540
by which I mean both single
molecule fluorescence,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.480
i.e., detection, as well as
single molecule manipulation,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.590
were almost exclusively
in vitro techniques.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.320
So we took purified
components, and then we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.350
studied the fluorescence,
or the mechanical properties

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.681
and so forth, of these molecules
in the equivalent of a test

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.180
tube.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.500
But really, in glass
slides, where we just

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.082
had to purified components,
so no know living cells.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:30.290
And I think we got a lot of
insight into the dynamics

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.050
of molecular motors,
transcription, translation,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.040
and so forth.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.200
And I think that many
of us in the field

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.700
thought that this paper was
essentially not possible.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.030
I did my Ph.D in the
single molecule area,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.140
from of 2002 to
2005, I graduated.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.230
And indeed, I did a
little bit of work

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.830
in this area of single
molecule fluorescence,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.070
and I was basically
unsuccessful.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.860
Even just doing this kind
of an in vitro setting.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.152
My lab is [INAUDIBLE],
we did primarily

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:06.360
single molecule manipulation.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.550
We were playing with the
single molecule fluorescence .

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.510
And eventually, people in
the lab got it to work.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.540
But I would say that my foray
into it was maybe unsuccessful.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.880
So I had a very healthy
respect for the challenges

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.520
that are involved in doing
single molecule fluorescence.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.142
And the thought of doing this
in live cells was very scary.

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:29.600
And I'd say that
many of us thought

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.900
it was not going to work.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.940
And indeed, this
project was one--

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.877
and the general goal of
studying a single molecule

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:38.460
dynamics in living
cells, is something

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.920
that's Sunney's group had
been working on, I think,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.930
for many years.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.060
And it indeed was very hard.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.150
But then there were
these two papers

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.850
they came out, both from
Sunnye's lab actually.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.380
And they came out both, i
think, in January of 2006,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.740
one in science, one in
Nature, demonstrating

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.850
not one way of doing
this, but rather two

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.897
ways of getting single molecule
dynamics inside living cells.

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.230
So today, obviously, we're
going to be primarily talking

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.872
about this paper by [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:05.580
But if you're interested
in these things,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.788
I encourage you to check
out [INAUDIBLE] paper, which

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:11.120
also published, [INAUDIBLE],
at the same time.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.940
And that was based on a
microfluidic assay, where

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.440
instead of doing
the single molecule

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.850
fluorescence within
cells, instead by trapping

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.170
the cells in small
volumes, and then using

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.270
more traditional enzymatic
assays, such as this beta

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.790
[INAUDIBLE] assay,
enclosed in a small volume,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.347
it's almost possible to
study, once again, these sort

00:03:30.347 --> 00:03:32.572
of busting dynamics in E. coli.

00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:34.530
And also they did it in
yeast, and demonstrated

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.970
that it's kind of a
generally practical assay.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.680
So if you're interested
in those papers,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.770
I encourage you to check it out.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.980
But for me, this was really
an eye-opening thing.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.400
So I graduated with my
Ph.D. in December of 2005,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.320
and then I went to a conference
in Cambridge, England,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.660
where where Sunney
presented this work.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.450
And I think that it really blew
many of our minds, this idea

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.420
that you could start to get this
sort of data within live cells.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.766
And indeed, Sunney's group
over the next five years

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.390
did a whole series
of what I'd consider

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.380
to be beautiful studies,
probing, for example,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.480
the dynamics of this [INAUDIBLE]
repressor binding, unbindings

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.750
onto this promoter,
the search process.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.250
Yeah.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.040
A whole slew of, I think,
really beautiful things.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.500
So we're not going
to have the chance

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.250
to go over all those
papers in this class,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.990
but I encourage you
to look at them.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.195
Can somebody say what
the primary challenge

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.320
is with doing single
molecule fluorescence

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.520
in these live cells?

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.230
So why is it that
I did not think

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.460
that this was going to work?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.360
And now, you're going to
have to give an argument that

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.583
ends up not being true.

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:04.308
But why is it that this is
such a hard thing to do.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:05.724
Yeah?

00:05:05.724 --> 00:05:08.084
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
laser at the cell

00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:09.500
but you can't kill the cell?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.830
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.329
OK.

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:18.030
So one is that there's
laser, the cell, and then

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.240
there's a big question mark.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.910
Is this going to be OK?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.550
And indeed, we certainly
know that at one limit,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.200
it's not going to be OK.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.530
If you take the lasers at
Los Alamos National Lab,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.144
you can vaporize the cell.

00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:36.060
So it's certainly enough
power, and the cell's

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.960
going to be dead for sure.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.485
And so the question
is maybe, oh,

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.590
can you dial down the
laser power enough to get--

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.840
and indeed, this is something
that they talk about,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.630
their strategy in this paper.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.090
Other challenges, problems?

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.850
AUDIENCE: Many molecules.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.760
PROFESSOR: Right. so the
principle of many molecules.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.650
So we have to figure out
some way of separating them,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.350
either temporarily or spatially.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.130
Indeed in this paper,
they actually do both.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.580
We say many molecules.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.860
And of course, we have to
decide what we mean by this.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.734
Because ultimately,
we're interested in doing

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:12.380
single molecule measurements.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.270
But then, of course, of the
plural of single is many.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.427
How many is too many for
us to study, and so forth?

00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:21.760
The question here is maybe
like, how to separate, right?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.757
What are other
challenges in this?

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:35.590
AUDIENCE: Diffusion.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.298
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:37.240
There's diffusion.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.211
So we're going to talk
more about this, for sure.

00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:41.710
Well, actually, all
of these things,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.793
we're going to talk about.

00:06:42.793 --> 00:06:43.400
Diffusion.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.790
And why is this a
problem, though?

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.290
Right.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.560
So it's diffusion is maybe fast.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.552
And so this is going to end
up being relevant for kind

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:59.120
of signal to noise reasons.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.955
So what's the signal
and what's the noise?

00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:15.470
AUDIENCE: Autofluorescence.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.756
So there's autofluorescence.

00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:21.390
So in particular, this noise
is autofluorescence from what?

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:29.809
AUDIENCE: From the cell.

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:30.850
PROFESSOR: From the cell.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.349
Right.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.996
And what's the signal,
just to be clear here?

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.217
AUDIENCE: Photons
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:43.217 --> 00:07:43.925
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:47.115
So it's photons from, in this
case, the GFP-like molecule.

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:48.520
Yeah?

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.920
So we want to do single
molecule measurements.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.590
We want to be able
to measure or detect

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.830
the fluorescence coming
from this single fluorescent

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.240
protein.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.600
Now the question is, if
it's a single molecule,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.350
does that mean that
it's going to send out

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.225
just a single photon?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.167
No.

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.750
Maybe they come out
as single photons.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.410
But we can detect them.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.090
Now the challenge in,
in some ways surprising,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.450
is not that the number
of photons is so small.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.310
Does anybody have any
rough sense of maybe

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.125
how many photons are we
collecting from each of these?

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.460
AUDIENCE: Many thousands.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.960
I'd say many thousands.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.090
In particular-- so we'll
say many thousands.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.610
It could be even 10 to
the 4 per second or so.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.300
It depends on the
laser intensity.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.630
Many thousands of
photons collected.

00:08:53.013 --> 00:08:53.961
Yes?

00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:55.460
AUDIENCE: That's
before [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.280
That's right.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.869
And indeed, the stronger
the intensity of the laser

00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:03.910
light that you illuminate
with, the faster you're

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.910
going to collect the
photons, but in general, it

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.100
won't increase the total number
of photons that you collect.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.910
So in these sorts
of situations, you

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.240
might get, say-- we'll say
10 to the 4, plus or minus

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.260
in order of magnitude,
photons per second.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.630
And they might
last for, depending

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.255
on how-- for 30 seconds or so.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:29.200
And of course, we'll look at the
actual numbers in this paper.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.880
But in many of
these situations--

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.925
times 10 to 100 seconds.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760
In this case, it
actually bleached faster.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.540
Right.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.519
But we'll see.

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.060
Well, you might be
able to get also--

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.956
if you use organic
dyes and other-- right.

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:52.830
But this gives you some
sense of that there's

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.079
a fair number of photons
that you could, in principle,

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:56.580
collect from a single molecule.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.390
Now, of course, you
might be worried, well,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.430
these are the photons that
you shine on your camera.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.760
But then your camera
won't pick up all of them.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.610
The way that we
think about this is

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.410
by what's known as the
quantum efficiency.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.510
Quantum efficiency
tells us basically

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:20.020
this is the fraction
of photons detected.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.725
But with modern cameras,
actually, this thing

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:25.690
is approximately one.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.350
So it's 0.9 maybe
with modern cameras,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.010
which is for our
purposes, basically one.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.150
Which means that you
can detect, actually,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.540
the majority of the photons
that are hitting your camera.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.130
From that standpoint,
the number of photons

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.270
is not actually the problem.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.970
You can collect many
thousands of photons.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.970
So the problem is really
detecting that signal

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.700
over the background signal.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.140
Over the autofluorescence
of the cell.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.910
And indeed, if you look
at the figure, figure one,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.900
you can very clearly see the
autofluorescence of the cell.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.550
So the fluorescence
where there's the cell

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.990
is indeed much larger than
where there's no cell.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.190
The autofluorescence is, I'd
say, the primary challenge

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.060
here.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.850
Of course, there are
many, many others.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.350
Right.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.300
So this is potentially
a big problem.

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.620
And in order to get
around that, there

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.720
are all these other
strategies that the author's

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.890
going to implement.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:37.638
Yes?

00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:39.054
AUDIENCE: What is
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:42.794 --> 00:11:43.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.170
So many things are
weakly fluorescent,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.750
I think is the short answer.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.285
And this also depends
upon, for example, cells

00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:53.660
are more autofluorescent if
you grow them in a rich media

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.540
than in minimal media, for
some mysterious reason.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.190
Yeah.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.510
But it's really just that
there are many things that

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.440
are weakly fluorescent.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.648
And it's just there are a
lot of molecules in a cell.

00:12:04.384 --> 00:12:06.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.890
In the case that you put
in a fluorescent protein

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.780
or a fluorescent
dye, then it has

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.430
rather well-defined absorption
and emission spectra.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.020
And each individual
absorber emitter

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.722
indeed has a well-defined
absorption emission profile.

00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:25.930
But then in the cell, there
are just many, many, many

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.740
of them, which means
that there's rather

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.970
what you want to
call an absorption

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.520
of broadband emission.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.150
So indeed, in some wavelengths,
it's worse than in others.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.130
But it's not that you get
well-defined peaks the way

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.130
you do for a single
kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.455
AUDIENCE: I guess I was
just wondering [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:48.130
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.300
And indeed, in this case,
they're exciting with a laser.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.900
So at least on the
excitation, it's

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.560
as precise as you can hope for.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.970
And indeed, on the emission
they will use a filter.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.790
So they're not going
to be absorbed.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.750
It's probably a few
tens of nanometers

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.350
that they're looking at.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.100
So in that sense, they
are filtering out,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.800
but still, there is
autofluorescence.

00:13:17.134 --> 00:13:19.570
All right.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:26.690
Now getting at this question
of the single molecule

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.720
fluorescence, the
limitations, diffusion,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.630
and so forth, it's
always valuable to have

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.840
a sense of scale in anything
that you're ever doing.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.170
So just let's wake up
by reminding ourselves,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.501
how big is a protein?

00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.000
Right.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.790
So, typical protein.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.590
Typical protein.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.590
And for now, we'll say e.g.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.840
For example, GFP or whatever.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.440
All right.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.110
We're not going to give you very
much time to think about this.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.020
But I just want to
make sure that we all

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.250
keep track of senses
of scale in the world.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.010
Ready.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.590
Three, two, one.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.170
All right.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.760
So we've got some B's, C's, D's.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.411
All right.

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:37.910
Wow.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:44.462
We got a lot of surprisingly
wide wide range, actually.

00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:45.840
[LAUGHING] OK.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.950
Well, we also have the mirror
image problem over here.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.200
OK, right.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.937
So, indeed, I'll say this
is a typical protein size.

00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:05.500
So, it's a few nanometers.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.270
Depending on, there are
some that get longer,

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.400
especially if you're
thinking about a long--

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.250
there are some structural--
well, you know.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.360
Of course, if you're talking
about filaments, they can be--

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.665
but if you're talking about
a typical globular protein,

00:15:19.665 --> 00:15:21.081
it's a few nanometers
in diameter.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.850
The question is,
let's say that this is

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.720
a fluorescent protein, or GFP.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.210
And now what we do
is we look at it.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.650
And we're going to get
some fluorescent spot.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:52.020
So this is plotting
the intensity

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.970
as a function of position.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.470
Right?

00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:04.140
So this is the intensity I
is a function of position X.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.790
Now the question
is, what is going

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.870
to be the size of the spot?

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.640
We conveniently have some
size scales up on the board.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.070
I'll let us think about
this for eight seconds.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.350
All right.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.080
Ready.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.530
Three, two, one.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.170
OK.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.670
We have a majority
of the group that

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.840
is saying that indeed,
it's going to be D.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.530
So this is what's known as
a diffraction limited spot.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.960
And this is a fundamental
physics limitation,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.790
that if you are imaging
something with light that

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.210
is of some wavelength,
lambda, this

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.765
is of order lambda over 2-- it
depends on numerical aperture

00:17:14.765 --> 00:17:15.890
or projective and so forth.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.940
But you know.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.990
So order of lambda.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.990
A little bit less maybe.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.800
And indeed, the
wavelength of the light

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.070
that's being used
here is-- they're

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.780
exciting with 500 something.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:39.630
And then let me just-- 514.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.050
OK.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.280
So indeed, what happens
is that we shine in light.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:52.340
So this is the lambda
incident that is 514.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.890
Now, there's going to be some
GFP that looks like this.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:02.060
And then, we're going to
get out lambda emission.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.560
All right.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.300
Question, is the emitted
light going to be equal?

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.650
Is the wavelength going
to be 514 nanometers?

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.250
Yes or no?

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.810
Ready?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.516
Three, two, one.

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:12.210
AUDIENCE: No.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.410
PROFESSOR: No.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.230
Lambda emission.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.330
Is it going to be greater than
or less than lambda incident?

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.130
Ready?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.602
Three, two, one.

00:18:20.602 --> 00:18:21.560
AUDIENCE: Greater than.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.730
PROFESSOR: Greater than.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.030
So this thing is
greater than 514.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.120
Now, if you just have scattering
off something-- so let's

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.510
say that we had a
gold particle, and we

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.290
shine-- what's going
to be the relationship

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.652
between lamba incident
and lambda emission?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.610
Is it possible to have the
same wavelength come out

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.965
as you put in of some object?

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.120
Yes.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.800
If you just have
something, a mirror,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.960
you can get back--
so it is possible.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.560
But in general, there's
going to be some dissipation.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.340
It's a question of
how much and so forth.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.600
But certainly for something
like fluorescence,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.260
you have a higher
energy photon, and you

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.790
have a photon that's emitted.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.090
And of course, energy
goes as 1 over lambda.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.070
Now, this is useful
because you can actually

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.590
spectrally separate things.

00:19:29.815 --> 00:19:31.190
I just want to
highlight, though,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.330
that if this separation
is of order 300

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:42.300
nanometers and our protein
is-- that [INAUDIBLE] our GFP.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.460
Nicely drawn.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.800
Not even quite to scale.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.340
To scale, it's
actually even smaller.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.430
It's a factor of 100 in size.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:58.480
This thing is only 3 nanometers
in size, 300 nanometers wide.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.790
Now, it's important to be
clear about what this means,

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.580
this diffraction limited spot.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.830
The first thing to note
is that what it means

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.900
is that if you have two
proteins-- so for example,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.560
I add another one
over here-- that it's

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.940
going to be very hard to
tell that we have those two

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.180
proteins next to each other.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.680
Because the resulting
fluorescence

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.670
pattern will look
essentially the same.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.320
Will it be exactly the same?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.920
What's going to change?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.710
The intensity.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.670
The intensity, you expect
to go up by a factor of two,

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.170
absent some interaction between.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.160
You can, in principle,
get interactions there.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.500
But let's for now assume
that there's no interaction.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:44.620
Right.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.161
Then the intensity wouldn't need
to go up by a factor of two.

00:20:47.161 --> 00:20:51.290
But unless you're very careful
about all of your optics

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.000
and so forth, it's
actually a challenge

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.610
to use this intensity alone
to distinguish these things.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.030
It's only-- so the statement
with a diffraction--

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.180
you need these two proteins
to be separated by something

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.190
like lambda over
2 in order for you

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.180
to start to see the separation.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.680
Right.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.870
Because then you have
something that looks like this.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.161
Something that looks like this.

00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:21.019
And then the sum of those
two, indeed-- so you say,

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:23.560
all right, well, it looks like
there are two molecules there.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:33.009
Now, I just want
to-- and the notion

00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:35.300
of a lot of these so-called
super resolution techniques

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.120
is figuring out a way to
distinguish these things,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.328
and we'll maybe say something
about that in a moment.

00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:42.030
But I just want to highlight
that if we come back

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.360
to the situation where we
have a single protein there.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:52.240
Now the question is,
how accurately can we

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.750
tell where that protein
is, if we know that there's

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.916
just a single protein there?

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.320
Now in particular,
this size of the spot

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:30.590
is telling us something,
but it might not

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.410
be quite as strong
of a limitation

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.300
as it appears at first glance.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.400
And that's because in
this case, well maybe

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.990
I'll bring it back, what
we see is a big spot.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.300
300 nanometers, kind of wide.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.450
But if we see this and we know
it's just a single protein

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.440
there, I mean, could the
protein be over here?

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.040
No.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.914
If the protein where
over here, then the spot

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:58.816
would be over there right.

00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:02.000
So actually, even though
the size of the spot

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.332
is 300 nanometers,
in principle, if you

00:23:04.332 --> 00:23:05.790
want to know where
that protein is,

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.327
if you know there's
just a single protein,

00:23:08.327 --> 00:23:10.160
well, in that case what
you want to know is,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.860
where's the center
of that distribution?

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.040
And that problem, well, the
width of the distribution

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.100
is relevant.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.910
But there's something else
that's also very relevant.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.600
And quite generally, if you
measure some quantity n times,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:42.960
and you want to know-- so you're
measuring the height of min

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.760
entering the army-- if you
want to know the mean, what

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.561
is it that determines your
uncertainty around the mean?

00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:55.060
Right.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.840
There's the sample size.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.850
Now, does the width of
the distribution enter?

00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:02.840
Yeah.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:11.590
So in general, your
uncertainty in the mean

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:16.070
is going to go with the width
of the distribution, sigma

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:23.005
of whatever, divided by--
what do I put down here?

00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:27.580
Root of N, where N is the
number of samples that we take.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:38.490
What this is saying
is that as we sample

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.210
this distribution
more and more, does

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.520
the standard deviation of the
distribution, does it go to 0?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.020
No.

00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:51.820
These are all
trivial statements,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.940
but I can't tell
you how many times

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.180
I see this getting confused.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:55.680
OK.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.450
So if you measure
many, many, many times,

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.260
you get a very
beautiful distribution.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.740
Right.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.570
The width of this
region of the sigma,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.805
that you get very accurately.

00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:08.744
It's true also that your
uncertainty in the width, that

00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:09.660
actually does go to 0.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.618
But the width of it, the
width doesn't go to 0.

00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:13.890
The width of the distribution.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.700
But your uncertainty in the
mean, that goes down as 1

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:23.100
over root of N. And what is N in
the case our detection business

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.650
here?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.670
The number of photons.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.170
Right?

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.550
Now, of course, in
the actual experiment,

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.600
we don't get precisely
this distribution.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.486
Instead, it's kind of
sort of quantized somehow

00:25:35.486 --> 00:25:36.860
spatially, because
we're actually

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.840
detecting it on a CCD chip.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.340
All right.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.760
So you can go and do the
math, figure out everything.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.635
But actually, that's
not as much a limitation

00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:45.220
as you might have expected.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.970
In many cases, the pixel
size on the image plane

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.060
is actually something
like 100 nanometers.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.662
So this distribution
that measure,

00:25:53.662 --> 00:25:56.120
although in principle it looks
like this, what you actually

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.410
measure is something that
looks like-- well, maybe I

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:09.960
should-- something like that.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.670
Right.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:16.990
Because you have discrete
pixels on the CCD.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.210
And it feels that that should
just kind of totally screw you.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.800
But if you go and
do the math, you

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.430
find it's not as bad
as you might expect.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.604
So broadly, you do get
essentially something

00:26:26.604 --> 00:26:28.020
that goes as 1
over the root of N,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.394
where N is the
number of photons.

00:26:29.394 --> 00:26:34.275
And if you collect 10 to the
4 photons, that actually,

00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:35.940
it's a lot of photons.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.740
So if we want to
know the uncertainty

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.530
in the center of our
distribution, well, this thing,

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.910
we might have something that's
of order 300 nanometers here.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.610
We take the square
root of 10 to the 4.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:51.630
All right.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.340
So we get to divide
by something like 100.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.330
And these are all
very rough numbers.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.180
But the point is
that we can get down

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.340
to nanometer resolution in
terms of the uncertainty

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.060
that which we know the
mean of that distribution.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:08.614
Yes?

00:27:08.614 --> 00:27:09.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:13.935
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:14.435
Right.

00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:15.940
So again, it's surprising.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.905
The thing is that
even with just two,

00:27:18.905 --> 00:27:20.530
in principle, we can
be very sensitive.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.029
Right?

00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:25.250
I mean, actually,
sometimes people actually

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.580
do just put it on like
quadrant photo detector, where

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.610
you really only get
essentially binary information.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.930
But even with just two, if I say
OK, well, it looks like this,

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.430
or if it looks a
little bit like that,

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.380
if there's no error in
our measurements there,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.120
then you can actually get
that location very well.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.950
Yeah.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.840
It's surprising.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.290
I'm not going to like.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.520
Yeah, but even with
this quantization

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.607
of some sort that's
due to the CCD, city

00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:54.565
you can still get down
to nanometer resolution.

00:27:58.697 --> 00:28:01.280
Your resolution is worse than
it would be if you knew actually

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.863
exactly where each
photon was hitting,

00:28:02.863 --> 00:28:06.660
but it's not very
sensitive, actually.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.400
And indeed, in the
presence of-- and

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.858
this is a highly
technical comment.

00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:12.550
But in the presence of
read noise and other kinds

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.050
of noise in the CCD,
actually, in many cases,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.610
it's actually better to
have somewhat larger pixels,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.960
again, than you would expect.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.432
So these balancing
many different things.

00:28:22.432 --> 00:28:24.390
People have thought
carefully about this stuff.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.780
But in the end, 100 nanometer
pixel is actually fine.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.120
And just to be clear, it's 100
nanometers at the sample plane.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.530
So it's typically
of order 10 microns

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.470
size on the camera itself.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:44.230
So the physical size of each of
the pixels on the cameras, 10

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.030
microns within a factor
of 2, between 5 and 20,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.840
but then you get 100x
typically magnification

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.620
at the sample point.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.510
So to be clear, 10
microns divided by 100

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.770
is 100 nanometers.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.280
Is everybody following?

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.820
OK I don't want to-- all right.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.710
The key thing--
three, you can ignore.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.940
But the key thing
to notice here is

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.370
this thing that's here, which
is nanometer resolution.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.510
And it's been known for decades
that this is, in principle,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.890
possible and so forth.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.790
But I think that within the
realm of single molecule

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:30.370
biophysics, it was really
popularized in some very nice

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:37.060
papers by Ahmet Yildiz,
et al, where they attached

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.240
single molecules onto the
heads of various motors

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.100
as they were walking
along tracks, and showing

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.190
that these motors were
walking kind of like this,

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:47.990
by catching fluorophores here,
and then you could really just

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.460
see it, see them walking it.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.460
Any questions about
why it's in principle

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.536
possible to get nanometer
resolution in this process?

00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:02.464
AUDIENCE: Doesn't this
assume that the protein

00:30:02.464 --> 00:30:04.874
is 100% static?

00:30:04.874 --> 00:30:05.838
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:30:05.838 --> 00:30:06.754
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:11.064 --> 00:30:11.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.480
Yeah, indeed.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.360
Right now, I'm assuming
that this thing is constant.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.330
And the question is like, how
much movement is a problem?

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.626
And so then you
have to-- you know.

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:22.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.360
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.210
So indeed, often, you're
trading off spatial resolution

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.690
for temporal resolution.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.455
And also, the intensity of
your laser, and so forth.

00:30:34.455 --> 00:30:35.830
But in these sort
of experiments,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.120
I think that what they
did is they slowed down

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.910
the motors quite a lot.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.410
So it was limiting ATP.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.260
So indeed, the motors
in those experiments,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.340
I think they were taking
steps of order every second

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:48.990
or 10 seconds.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.080
I mean, it was as slow as
you can go, and still, yes.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.530
And then at each
location, I think

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.175
they were collecting 10 to the
4 or a few 10 to the 4 photons.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.080
And incidentally
in this case, these

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.850
are the photons that
are being collected.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.100
And typically, you
would only be collecting

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.820
10%, 15% of the photons.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.380
Because the photons are actually
being emitted everywhere.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.180
But you only collect the ones
that go back to your objective.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.750
All right.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.710
I just want to make one comment
about the super resolution

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.500
techniques that
have been spreading.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.000
So the question
here is, well, let's

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.804
say that you have two
proteins next to each other.

00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:32.470
What can you do?

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.610
Now, the basic idea of all these
super resolution techniques

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.200
is that if we know that we have
a signal for only one protein,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.120
then we can actually
figure out where it is.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.619
So what you need
to do is figure out

00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:51.595
a way so you just have
one at a time emitting.

00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:53.220
So there are various
schemes to make it

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.690
so that these proteins
can either turn on or off.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.774
Now, what you can do is
if just one turns on,

00:32:00.774 --> 00:32:02.690
you got some photons,
you say OK, this protein

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.610
goes over here.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:08.970
Then if later, this other
protein becomes fluorescent,

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.090
now you can figure
out where that is.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.860
And so you do this basic
super resolution localization

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.110
multiple times, and then you
can identify where things are.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.240
Yeah.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.170
So all the microscopy
guys really

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:30.960
like to have fun acronyms.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:38.735
So these guys, when they did
it, they called it FIONA.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.900
So this is-- is it DreamWorks?

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.290
Or this is where the green
ogre like that and then

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.350
the red head?

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.190
AUDIENCE: Shrek.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.620
PROFESSOR: Shrek?

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:50.950
All right.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.460
So Shrek.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.710
And so Fiona was the redhead.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.960
And this stands for
fluorescent imaging

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.410
with 1 nanometer accuracy.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.610
And then indeed, a
group at UCSF then

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.910
developed SHREK, which is
simultaneous high resolution

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.610
imaging-- something.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.110
OK.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.360
I can't remember how it ended.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.210
But, yeah.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.170
So the super
resolution techniques,

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:21.150
they call them-- so Xiaowei
Zhuang at Harvard called

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.050
hers STORM, stochastic
reconstruction

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.270
of something or another.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.860
So this is the Zhuang method.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.150
And then Eric Betzig
called his PALM, which

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.230
stood still for something else.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.820
I don't know.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.570
But in particular,
Betzig-- there's

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.840
a long history of the
hard core microscopists,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.695
somehow like, developing their
techniques in their garages.

00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:50.320
I don't know what it
is, but there have

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.550
been a number of these cases.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.450
And Betzig I think
was one of them.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.620
Now he's at Janelia
Farm, HHMI, and has

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.264
been developing all sorts of
advanced microscopy techniques.

00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:01.930
So I think that that
[INAUDIBLE] did not

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.930
develop hers in the garage.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:04.490
But um--

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.050
AUDIENCE: And they're all
based on the same principle--

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.870
It's all about temporal.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.780
It's a question of
how you're getting

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.150
them to turn on and off.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.610
AUDIENCE: It sounds like
[INAUDIBLE] acronyms.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.041
PROFESSOR: Oh do they also have?

00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:21.250
AUDIENCE: ROSY, COZY, NOSY.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.089
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:22.630
Right, right.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.338
For the different
sequences or something?

00:34:24.338 --> 00:34:25.141
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.639
All of these acronyms,
maybe I just never came up

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.490
with a good one, so then I--

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.820
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.870
Indeed.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.610
I always like when somebody
uses acronyms that I don't know,

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.761
I always like to say, oh,
all these TLAs are tricky,

00:34:47.761 --> 00:34:48.260
or whatever.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.002
And then I say, it's
three letter acronym.

00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:53.480
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.830
PROFESSOR: I very much like
self-referential humor.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.420
OK.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.670
So that's the idea of the
super resolution techniques.

00:35:06.924 --> 00:35:08.340
Any questions about
that before we

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.140
kind of get back
actually to the paper?

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.660
OK.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.140
Now in this whole discussion,
as was pointed out,

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.950
we've been assuming that the
protein is not moving around

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.430
during our imaging time.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.120
So one of the major challenges
of doing this whole business

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.410
in live cells is
not only is there

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:33.230
a lot of autofluorescence,
but in addition, you

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.970
can't necessarily
wait 10 seconds

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.190
to localize where this thing
is, because it will have

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:41.180
moved somewhere else right.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.250
And in particular,
diffusion is a problem.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:50.272
Can somebody remind
us what the authors

00:35:50.272 --> 00:35:52.355
did in order to get around
the diffusion problems?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.902
I'm sorry what was it?

00:35:56.902 --> 00:35:58.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.640
PROFESSOR: They attached
it to the membrane.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.950
And why does that help?

00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:08.854
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:08.854 --> 00:36:09.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.920
That's perfect.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.270
Proteins diffuse slower.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.877
And I think depending
on the organism,

00:36:13.877 --> 00:36:15.960
there's more or less
diffusion and so forth right.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:25.500
But what they did is they
anchored to the membrane

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.960
to reduce diffusion.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.418
I'll just say it
reduces diffusion.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.969
And indeed, just from a back
of the envelope calculation,

00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:38.760
you can convince yourself
that you probably

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.770
are going to need to do this.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.160
So in particular, let's
ask-- in this paper,

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.390
actually, they image the
fluorophore for 0.1 seconds,

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.610
right?

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.790
Does that sound right?

00:36:53.790 --> 00:37:05.340
So the image collected, so
delta t is equal to 0.1 sets.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.870
So the question is, how far
will a protein typically

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.590
diffuse in 0.1 seconds?

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.620
Well, this is why we have
diffusion calculations.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.630
Right.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:23.020
First of all, the
diffusion coefficient,

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.210
we're going to talk more about
diffusion in a few weeks.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.077
But you should also
in principal be

00:37:30.077 --> 00:37:31.660
able to calculate
how these things go.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.750
So in general,
this is going to be

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:39.860
a kT over some gamma, which
tells us how hard-- so kT is

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.791
thermal energy.

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.290
OK.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.940
So, thermal.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.530
And at room temperature
kT is around 4.1

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.095
piconewton nanometers
in some unit.

00:37:53.095 --> 00:37:55.435
There are many different
ways you can write that.

00:37:55.435 --> 00:38:00.730
Whereas gamma tells us just how
hard it is to push something.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:05.370
In particular, if you
push them with some force,

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.650
it will move with some velocity.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:13.040
Now is this consistent
with freshman mechanics?

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.940
No.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.640
It's not.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.140
OK.

00:38:21.975 --> 00:38:22.725
Is that a problem?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.080
So why is it that
I'm writing this?

00:38:30.555 --> 00:38:32.554
AUDIENCE: Solvents exerting
a force [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:32.554 --> 00:38:33.262
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:38:33.262 --> 00:38:35.630
So solvents exerting a force.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.600
That's true.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.970
But in the case of
freshman mechanics,

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.100
when we're pushing
blocks, it's also true

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.050
that the other things
are exerting forces.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.780
The tables.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.210
But we still write
down F is equal to MA.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.365
So it's not just that other
things are exerting forces.

00:38:52.365 --> 00:38:53.335
Yeah?

00:38:53.335 --> 00:38:57.101
AUDIENCE: They're
always in a continuum?

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.476
PROFESSOR: Always
in a continuum.

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:01.380
AUDIENCE: They're always
surrounded by [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.160
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.130
Yeah.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.020
It's always surrounded--
but I'm actually

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.290
surrounded by fluid now too.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.364
You know, you can wave
your arms and feel it.

00:39:10.364 --> 00:39:11.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.155
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:39:12.155 --> 00:39:13.790
So it comes down
to the viscosity.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:16.890
Indeed, this whole thing about
being a low Reynolds number,

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.690
we're going to talk about
this in much more detail

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.880
in a few weeks, when we think
about how bacteria swim,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.740
and so forth.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.280
But I just want to
mention that this

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.780
is because we're at this
low Reynolds number, where

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:33.020
the so-called inertial forces,
like momentum are negligible.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.370
Inertia forces are negligible.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.470
So then it's really,
this is in some ways

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:40.090
more like Aristotelian
physics, but it ends up

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.800
being true for small
objects in viscous liquids.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.100
And indeed, this thing
it scales as the radius.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:56.780
So in principle, we can
actually calculate roughly

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.054
how the diffusion coefficient
is going to behave

00:39:59.054 --> 00:39:59.970
as a function of size.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:00.990
The object and so forth.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:05.270
But I'll just tell you that
for a protein size object

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.550
in the cell, you
might get something

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.920
like 10 micron
squared per second.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:19.590
Now, already just
from units, you

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.180
can see how the kind of
typical diffusion distance

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.800
has to scale with time.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.800
And in particular,
you're going to get

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.700
that the typical
kind of distance

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:35.590
that you go in a
typical distance-- we'll

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.570
say square root, because it's
the square root of 2 times D

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.450
times time.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.272
So you can see if you
multiply the time by the D,

00:40:44.272 --> 00:40:45.880
then you end up with
a micron squared,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.475
so you have to take a square
root to get something that's

00:40:48.475 --> 00:40:51.320
a characteristic distance.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.450
And indeed, this is the
kind of math that I can do.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.230
So this is an order one micron.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.483
And how big is an E. coli cell?

00:41:06.483 --> 00:41:07.780
AUDIENCE: One micron?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.450
PROFESSOR: One micron,
roughly, right?

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.860
So it might be a
couple microns long.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.400
A bit less than a
micron in width.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.842
And what this is saying
is that 0.1 seconds, which

00:41:15.842 --> 00:41:17.300
is our exposure
time on our camera,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.660
you would expect
something like GFP

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.550
to diffuse around
roughly the cell volume.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.951
And maybe not the entire one,
but a fair fraction of it.

00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:26.950
What this is saying is
that the diffusion really

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.114
would be a problem, even with
this relatively short exposure

00:41:30.114 --> 00:41:30.614
time.

00:41:30.614 --> 00:41:31.916
Yeah?

00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:32.833
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:33.457
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:35.424
So this is assuming
that the cytoplasm has

00:41:35.424 --> 00:41:37.340
a viscosity that's maybe
an order of magnitude

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.380
larger than water.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.030
And that's just
because the inside

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.510
is chock full of
proteins and so forth.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.050
Now, there's a lot
of discussion of what

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.170
the mechanism is of diffusion
and transport inside cells.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.630
It may depend on the size.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.420
It's a very complicated area.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.171
But for our purposes,
this is a reasonable way

00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:55.920
to think about it.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.270
But indeed, the viscosity
of the cytoplasm, you'd

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.900
expect to be significantly more
than the viscosity of water.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.563
Yeah?

00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:08.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
lower the [INAUDIBLE] time?

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.475
PROFESSOR: Lower the?

00:42:09.475 --> 00:42:10.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.982
Like two orders of
magnitude instead of one?

00:42:11.982 --> 00:42:12.690
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.390
So in principle, we could.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.610
There are technical
issues on various sides.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.340
So of course, you have to say,
oh well, a typical camera, just

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.280
the shutter of
opening, shutting,

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.670
that actually has some limit.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.640
But you can get around that
using kind of strob-- you know,

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.930
there are fancy
things you can do.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.460
But there's just a more
fundamental thing here,

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.380
which is-- so this is
already 100 milliseconds.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.660
If you go down to like
say, 1 millisecond,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.220
then it's true that
the protein won't

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.344
be able to diffuse very
far, but then you also just

00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:42.704
don't collect any photons.

00:42:42.704 --> 00:42:44.370
The number of photons
you collect scales

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:45.670
linearly with the time, right?

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.461
So at some point, it's
just that you really

00:42:47.461 --> 00:42:48.730
don't get very many photons.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.300
And then again, you
have this extra problem

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.630
of distinguishing
the fluorescence

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.270
from the autofluorescence.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.630
And I just want to maybe
mention one more thing.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.720
In Figure 1, you
can actually see

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:06.300
how big the fluorescence
intensity of this Venus protein

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.310
is, as compared to
the autofluorescence.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.030
And you see that if you decrease
that exposure time by even one

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.360
order of magnitude, you
wouldn't be able to see them

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.480
over the background.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.040
Right?

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.360
And that's true, even
though they won't

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.250
have had a chance to diffuse.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.368
It's just that you don't
have enough signal.

00:43:20.368 --> 00:43:21.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.110
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:25.610
Right.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.340
So you can also
increase the intensity.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.880
Yeah, that's right.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.090
And there is some
limit to how much

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.310
you can increase the
intensity of the laser,

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.390
just because there
is some cycling

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:41.940
time of the protein in
terms of, you excite it,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.190
and then it takes some time
before it's going to emit.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:47.270
So that actually sets
a fundamental limit.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.700
Yeah, I don't know enough
about the details of this

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.460
in the sense of whether maybe it
would've been possible for them

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.250
to try to adjust these
various parameters

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.350
to do it in some other way.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:02.050
But these are all the
things you have to consider.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:02.550
Question?

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:12.770
OK.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.280
So what we have now
is some sense-- OK,

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.000
we need to maybe anchor
into the membrane

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.160
to reduce the diffusion.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:19.660
All right.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.290
So they did that.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.487
And we'll maybe say something
more about this anchoring

00:44:24.487 --> 00:44:25.320
process in a moment.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.620
But first, I want to
make sure that we're

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.987
all on the same page
in understanding

00:44:29.987 --> 00:44:32.570
their arguments for why this is
a single molecule that they're

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.990
looking at.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.319
Can somebody remind us
their primary evidence

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:39.610
that this is a single molecule?

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:57.520
So question is, a molecule ,
we'll say single fluorophore,

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:05.140
just to-- question mark.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.139
How do we know?

00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:07.555
AUDIENCE: The
intensity drops off.

00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:08.263
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:08.263 --> 00:45:11.850
The intensity
drops off suddenly.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.960
So if you look at the intensity
as a function of time,

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.990
what you see is that it
looks like, and then.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:27.199
So it's actually more noise,
but this is just to-- now

00:45:27.199 --> 00:45:29.240
this is what it looks like
for a single molecule,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.080
but we should also be
clear of what it would look

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.540
like if it were many molecules.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.610
So this is if it's
a single molecule.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:41.770
And this is what we
call a bleach event.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.480
And so the molecule dies
for one reason or another.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.460
So it goes, some oxygen
reaction, something.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.650
Now the question is,
what happens if it

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.370
said there are many molecules?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.797
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:03.797 --> 00:46:04.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.120
Now, what we want
to do is imaginn--

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.150
let's say that we
shined light on a bead

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.429
containing
fluorescence, containing

00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:12.345
fluorescent molecules.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.515
So I'm going to give
us some options.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.400
It could be many molecules.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:22.900
OK.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.581
We could.

00:46:43.712 --> 00:46:44.240
All right.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.086
I'll give you a
choice those three.

00:46:47.086 --> 00:46:48.960
AUDIENCE: So we're
talking about [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.585
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:53.440
I'm asking if instead-- what
happens in the microscope

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.720
is you see a spot.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.711
And the spot is always huge.

00:46:57.711 --> 00:46:58.210
Right?

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.850
300 nanometers.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.710
So there could be one molecule
there, or there could be 100.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.940
You could fit 1,000 in there.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.490
No problem.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:05.990
Right?

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.185
10 by 10 by 10 molecules?

00:47:07.185 --> 00:47:08.560
That still is only
30 nanometers.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.880
That's still much smaller
than defraction limited spot.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.710
So of course, if
you see something,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:18.780
and the spot is 10
microns in width,

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.630
you'd be pretty confident
that either your optics suck,

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.504
or you're looking
at many molecules.

00:47:24.504 --> 00:47:26.170
But if you see
diffraction limited spot,

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.040
then it's not so obvious.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.430
And so the question
is, if you plot

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.221
the intensity of a
diffraction limited spot

00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:32.134
as a function of
time, how do you know

00:47:32.134 --> 00:47:33.300
that it's a single molecule?

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.210
They claim, oh well,
it's because of this.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.880
But it's always
good to be clear.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.465
What would it look like if it
were not a single molecule,

00:47:39.465 --> 00:47:44.240
but instead it were a collection
of molecules> Let's go ahead

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:44.870
and vote.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:45.750
Ready?

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.745
Three, two, one.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.340
So we have a fair number
of different responses.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.209
It seems to be a split across
the room is the only problem.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.750
So I'm not going to
have you discuss,

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.550
because I think your neighbors
typically agree with you.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.180
But in this case,
it's going to be

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.251
C. And this, it was an
attempt of mine of drawing--

00:48:08.251 --> 00:48:08.750
what is it?

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.395
Exponential distribution.

00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:14.040
So you'll see exponential decay.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.490
So this is typical
of processes where

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:20.230
something is happening at
a constant rate over time,

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.110
and then you're seeing
this thing go away.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.060
So this could be, for
example, radioactivity

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.831
is the classic thing
we always talk.

00:48:27.831 --> 00:48:28.830
These are random events.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.289
We thought the radiation
coming off of some source

00:48:31.289 --> 00:48:33.705
is a function of time that's
going to decay exponentially.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:42.350
Similarly here, now
this is-- again,

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.130
intensity is a function of time.

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.790
In the case of
many molecules, we

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.960
get this thing that look
like C. Now, there's

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.140
going to be some time scale
here which is telling us

00:48:54.140 --> 00:49:00.250
about the typical time for this
bleach event, which we're told

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:00.750
is what?

00:49:03.637 --> 00:49:04.345
250 milliseconds.

00:49:08.102 --> 00:49:09.810
And indeed, this is
telling us, actually,

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:13.660
that they're already
illuminating these guys

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.420
at pretty high intensity.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:19.380
Because 250 milliseconds
is not that long.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.311
Yes?

00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:28.227
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:32.085 --> 00:49:32.710
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:33.970
AUDIENCE: Is it
really a function

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.095
common photons [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.152
PROFESSOR: It's not
really a function of the--

00:49:40.152 --> 00:49:42.527
it ends up being a function
of the number of photons that

00:49:42.527 --> 00:49:44.310
are emitted, but that's
basically because you're

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.518
in kind of some ground state.

00:49:45.518 --> 00:49:47.900
You excite up to
this other state.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.430
And then, you get this
relaxation to a lower state.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:55.440
So this is the energy
of the absorbed photon.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.710
This is the energy of
the emitted photon.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:01.570
The idea is that each time you
go around this cycle, that's

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.810
one emission cycle,
there's some probability

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:09.030
that's small-- 1 in 10 to the
5, or something like that--

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.950
that it reacts with
oxygen, or something that

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.520
causes it to go to the start.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.854
And it's in principle,
irreversible state.

00:50:14.854 --> 00:50:17.520
Of course, the dynamics of these
things can be more complicated,

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.700
but that's the [INAUDIBLE]
way of thinking about it.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:24.340
What that means is that
that's more or less

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:29.060
a constant number of photons
that you're going to get out.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.890
There are many cases where
this approximation fails.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:42.644
This single step bleaching is
kind of a classic signature

00:50:42.644 --> 00:50:44.060
of the fact that
you're looking at

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.640
a single fluorescent molecule.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.360
Now, there are
secondary arguments

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.804
for why this is a
single [INAUDIBLE] Venus

00:50:55.804 --> 00:50:56.970
they're looking at was what?

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:09.110
What was their
supporting evidence?

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:09.710
Yes?

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.686
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:11.686 --> 00:51:13.186
The intensity matched what?

00:51:13.186 --> 00:51:14.102
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.380
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.963
So what they said
is, well, all right.

00:51:18.963 --> 00:51:25.750
This intensity matched what
they measured on a slide.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.800
Just the molecule.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.640
But I'd say this really is, I
would say, supporting evidence,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.770
because the intensity
of the fluorescence

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:38.010
can just be different in
different environments.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:42.470
I think that this is kind of
thing that it's-- there are

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:43.750
many ways that this can fail.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.920
Right, so I think that
in general, we consider

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.128
this to be the gold standard.

00:51:53.935 --> 00:51:55.430
All right.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.890
Now in their experimental
setup, there's

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.390
something that's,
I think, very nice

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:10.760
that they do, which is,
if you look at the-- now

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.725
this is the we'll say,
laser illumination.

00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:19.080
Here, this is kind of
on, and this is off.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.460
What they do is every three
minutes, they illuminate.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:36.670
And then, this is not to scale.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.920
This was 1.2 seconds.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.850
So we might want to even--
there's a separation in there.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.430
So they illuminate
for 1.2 seconds,

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:58.020
and they collect the light
for the first 0.1 seconds.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:11.930
This is the period where
they collect for 0.1.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:16.480
Can somebody tell us why they
might possibly want to do this?

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.630
Shine more light on the
sample than they need to?

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:24.530
They're not going to
analyze that data.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.920
So this is an intentional
bleaching step.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.975
So this part here is to bleach.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.232
And we'll see that this is
actually essential for the way

00:53:40.232 --> 00:53:41.690
that they're
collecting their data.

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.520
Given everything
that we've just said,

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:51.170
you should be able to tell me
what fraction of the molecules

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.500
will not be bleached.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.780
That survive bleaching.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.075
Survive the so-called
bleaching step.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.640
You can ignore my writing.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.681
You should be able to
think about it on your own.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.390
I'll go ahead, and I'll give you
30 seconds to think about this.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:44.925
And I think all
of the information

00:54:44.925 --> 00:54:48.960
that you need is in principle
written up on the board.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.914
Yes?

00:54:49.914 --> 00:54:50.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:04.120
I'm assuming that they
start out being fluorescent.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.444
Now over time, we're
illuminating them

00:55:06.444 --> 00:55:07.360
with this laser light.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.100
So eventually, they will bleach.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:17.320
But perhaps some of them have
survived for that entire 1.2

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:17.820
seconds.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.750
So if you looked at it
after this bleaching step,

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.000
it would still be fluorescent.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.610
Maybe another 30
seconds, because--

00:55:55.994 --> 00:55:56.910
Do you need more time?

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.930
Let me see where we
are, just so that we

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:07.330
can get a sense of things.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:07.870
Ready?

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.870
Three, two, one.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:13.460
All right.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.000
Great.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.060
We're roughly
uniformly distributed

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.941
between-- all right.

00:56:18.941 --> 00:56:19.440
Perfect.

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.680
So this is an opportunity
to turn to your neighbor

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.170
and discuss.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.450
You should, even with
back of the envelope

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:29.610
calculations in your head, be
able to get roughly where this.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:32.560
But you're also welcome, if
you want, to double check.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.450
Pull out your iPhone.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.150
You can use the
Google calculator.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.660
I give you just a minute or
two to turn to a neighbor.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.535
You should certainly be
able to find somebody

00:56:39.535 --> 00:56:41.316
that disagrees with you.

00:56:41.316 --> 00:58:07.102
[STUDENT CHATTER]

00:58:07.102 --> 00:58:09.060
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and reconvene?

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.330
It's OK if you're still
kind of confused by this.

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:13.940
I've partly doing
this to encourage

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.360
you to review your
probability distributions,

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.320
because we are going to
dive into them rather

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.100
strongly over the next week.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.009
And so it's good--
if you can't quite

00:58:23.009 --> 00:58:24.550
remember how these
are going to work,

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.290
it's good to start
reviewing now.

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:26.790
All right.

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:27.956
Can I just see where we are?

00:58:27.956 --> 00:58:28.480
Ready?

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.290
Three, two, one.

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:31.790
OK.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:35.380
So we have some B's and C's.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.782
All right.

00:58:36.782 --> 00:58:38.490
I'm pretty confident
it's B, although I'm

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.879
a little bit worried now.

00:58:40.879 --> 00:58:42.420
All right, so what's
going to happen?

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.230
So basically, the probability
that this thing survives

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.610
as a function of
time is the same

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.790
as, essentially, the decay
and the overall intensity

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.006
fluorescence for many
molecules over time.

00:58:56.006 --> 00:58:57.630
Because this plot
here is really a plot

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.285
of the fraction of
the molecules that

00:59:00.285 --> 00:59:02.380
have survived as a
function of time.

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.510
Right.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:07.400
So indeed, the
probability of survival

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.660
for an exponential process like
this is a function of time, t,

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:15.610
is going to be equal
to e to the minus t

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.700
over some constant [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.780
And what is t in tau?

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:27.630
Well, t is this
time 1.2 seconds.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.610
So we have e to the-- we'll
write it like an exponent.

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:35.720
So now we have a minus.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:41.060
We have 1.2 seconds divided by
the lifetime in this condition,

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.840
we're told is 250 milliseconds.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.880
So we can write 0.25 seconds.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:56.150
So this is approximately
e to the minus 5,

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:59.715
which indeed, is equal to
what I thought is 0.8%.

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:09.240
So it's around 1%,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.670
Are there any questions about
this logic or this calculation?

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:15.036
Yes?

01:00:15.036 --> 01:00:15.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.349
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, no.

01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.890
Sorry, sorry.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:22.640
No, no.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:29.200
Bleaching, this is a result
of chemical inactivation

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.210
of the fluorescent protein
that is kind of induced

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:35.900
by being in this excited state.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.460
So the idea is that if
you're shining light

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.800
on this fluorescent
protein, then

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:48.160
it's going to bleach at a rate
that is kind of-- distribution

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.920
of say, lifetime's going to
be exponential with a time

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.430
constant of 250 milliseconds.

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:54.346
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:57.301 --> 01:00:58.300
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:58.890
That's right.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.890
But it's a one-step
process though.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.890
That's what we see here.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.160
It's not that that
individual protein

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.960
is getting worse and
worse as it's being used.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.890
But it's really just
that there's some rate

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:11.590
that it-- some
probability, of course,

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:15.701
time that it cycles that it is,
we'll say for now, irreversibly

01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:16.200
inactivated.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.620
There are also all these
so-called blinking events,

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:27.360
where fluorescent molecules
can kind of temporarily

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.065
go into a non-fluorescent
state, and then they return,

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:33.620
but right now, we're talking
about these irreversible steps.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.830
Are there any other questions
about what I mean by bleaching,

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.570
or this calculation?

01:01:47.054 --> 01:01:48.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.300
PROFESSOR: So my claim
is that 0.8% is very

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.264
close, is approximately 1%.

01:01:54.264 --> 01:01:55.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:01.240
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.025
I did something funny here.

01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:03.525
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.989
So it's useful to just kind of
go through these calculations.

01:02:12.989 --> 01:02:15.030
And actually, I think that
in going through them,

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.820
you kind of really get
to get a sense of why

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.736
they design their
experiments the way they did

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:20.080
and everything.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.000
So the idea is that what they're
doing here every three minutes,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.890
they're looking at the
cells, and they're asking,

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.160
is there are a protein, or
maybe more than one here?

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.910
And then they try to kill all
those fluorescent proteins.

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:39.170
And then they look again
three minutes later.

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:43.210
Are there any new
proteins that were made.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:43.860
Yes?

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.979
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:49.230
You can't see it [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.230
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.730
You don't--

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.944
AUDIENCE: Do you calibrate
the intensity [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:52.944 --> 01:02:55.360
PROFESSOR: So what they're
really doing is they're asking,

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.140
how many spots do I see?

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.340
So in that experiment,
they don't know

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.330
that it was a single molecule.

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:06.700
Although I think that in many--

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.111
AUDIENCE: Then why do they
talk about this [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:11.111 --> 01:03:13.110
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
how they checked to make

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.437
sure it was a single molecule.

01:03:14.437 --> 01:03:16.520
Although I think that
actually, in principle here,

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.310
I think they actually maybe
do continue to look at them.

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:21.727
That's not part
of their analysis.

01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:23.310
So for many of the
case, they actually

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.800
do see that this molecule is
here, and then it bleaches,

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.590
and a different molecule
was here, and it bleached.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.110
But what they're really
asking is at the beginning,

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.654
how many fluorescent
proteins did I see?

01:03:37.654 --> 01:03:40.070
And I think the camera actually
maybe was collecting still

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:41.195
during that bleaching step.

01:03:41.195 --> 01:03:43.050
It's just that it wasn't
kind of part of it.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:46.624
Their analysis is in some ways
really just based on this.

01:03:46.624 --> 01:03:48.290
Or in other experiments,
you can go look

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:51.155
to confirm that it
bleaches single step here.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:56.580
OK.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.320
So we spent a long time talking
like the general idea of how

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.680
to design these
experiments and so forth.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.900
I'm not going to say very
much about the design

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.560
of the experiments, except
that they did a number things.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.640
They used this
Venus protein that

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.320
has a faster maturation
than traditional GFP.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.610
They also targeted
it to the membrane,

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.500
not by putting Venus
into the membrane-- that

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.920
would be tricky, I
think-- but rather

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.560
by attaching the Venus protein
to another protein that

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.080
is put in the membrane.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.124
And indeed, this TSR
membrane protein,

01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:35.540
we're going to be
talking about it

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.600
in a couple of weeks
when we're discussing

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.660
the chemotaxis network that is
in E. coli for how E. coli find

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.030
food and so forth.

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:46.820
I think that in reading these
papers, it's interesting.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.720
Sometimes, authors make
kind of a side comment

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.775
that just illuminates kind of
how difficult everything was.

01:04:52.775 --> 01:04:54.650
And I think that they
had a nice one in here,

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:58.560
where they said that they were
checking with TSR to make sure

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.130
that the behavior of the
TSR Venus and just Venus

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.670
were similar in terms of
the amount of fluorescence.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.120
And then, they say,
no notable difference

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.810
was observed, indicating that
the introduction of the TSR

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.890
sequence does not change the
yield of Venus production,

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:18.560
which is not the case for
many other membrane targeting

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.060
sequences that we tested.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.020
So this is like, a little
add-on onto the sentence

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.480
that is like, I mean, six
months of somebody's life

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.870
was dedicated to
trying-- you can just

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:33.190
imagine all the over
coffee, their frustration.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:34.940
They tried all of
these different things,

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.100
and they always got-- and for
an awful lot of these things,

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.860
I would have still been very
much interested in the study,

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:48.092
even if the addition of TSR
did change the kinetics.

01:05:48.092 --> 01:05:50.050
Because I think that
still is very interesting.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:52.890
But they really wanted
this to be just airtight,

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:55.030
or maybe the referees
need to be-- I don't know.

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.238
But you can tell that they
just went to a lot of work

01:05:57.238 --> 01:06:01.550
to try to find the thing where
everything would be just right.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.610
Now, once they kind of
described their setup,

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:15.020
they had this wonderful
paragraph, I think.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.900
They say, oh, these proteins,
they're generating bursts,

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.945
and the number in
the bursts varies,

01:06:19.945 --> 01:06:21.320
and there's spread,
and so forth.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.740
And they very nicely
tell us, with this data,

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.510
we can ask four questions.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.700
And they say, do these
gene expression bursts

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.135
occur randomly in time?

01:06:31.135 --> 01:06:33.030
That's going to be yes.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:35.730
How many mRNA new molecules
are responsible for each gene

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.620
expression burst under
the repressed conditions?

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.050
One.

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.570
What is the distribution of
the number of protein molecules

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:43.620
in each burst?

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:46.710
It's going to be
geometrically distributed.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.890
And what is the origin
of the temporal spread

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.760
of the individual bursts?

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.489
And now, I think
that this is nice,

01:06:52.489 --> 01:06:54.030
just to give a reader
a kind of like,

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:57.200
heads up of where we're heading.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.690
And the origin of
the temporal spread

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:02.960
is actually-- they're arguing
is actually the Venus maturation

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.030
time.

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.940
So in that case, the
fact that there's

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.000
a finite time for
maturation of the Venus

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.810
ends up allowing them
to measure the bursts

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:12.340
in an interesting way.

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.520
Before we get into
the details of that,

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:19.680
though, I want to make sure
that we're all clear about what

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.270
they mean by a burst.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.450
Because this is
something that is oddly--

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:29.690
it feels like it's the most
trivial statement ever.

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.970
But I think what we're going
to find is that there's

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:34.672
a lot of confusion about it.

01:07:34.672 --> 01:07:36.255
This is a question,
how is it that you

01:07:36.255 --> 01:07:39.360
go from the data to the
quantities that they plot

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.070
and that they're interested in?

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:44.210
We want to get a sense of
how many proteins are made

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:46.410
in each one of these bursts?

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:50.150
And so they have
in Figure 3B, they

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:54.100
plot the number of protein
molecules produced.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.150
Number of proteins produced.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.425
It's a function of time.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.790
And they have these things.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.690
And This was a cell
division event.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:16.010
And here they say, we have 2, 4.

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:22.439
And here at 25 minutes,
we have this thing here,

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:23.410
and it looks like.

01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:31.510
And then this thing goes on.

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:41.109
And there's 50, we have
another, and so forth.

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:46.930
This is a zoom in of
Figure 3B, the top panel.

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:51.880
So what I want to know is, what
is the size of the first burst?

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:27.500
So you can either look at my
beautifully drawn illustration,

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.950
or you can look at the
paper in front of you.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:33.170
So this is a paper analyzing
the size distribution

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:37.960
of protein bursts
observed in living cells.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.479
Right?

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.319
That's the point of this paper.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.950
Now, the question is, from
the data they're collecting,

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.598
we want to know what is the
size of the protein burst?

01:09:49.598 --> 01:09:50.598
The first protein burst.

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:08.815
Now, there's no
calculation for you to do.

01:10:08.815 --> 01:10:12.050
There's not much of one.

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.820
So I'm not going to
give you maybe anymore

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.357
time to figure this out.

01:10:15.357 --> 01:10:16.440
So let's see where we are.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.300
Ready?

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.450
Three, two, one.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.010
All right.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:25.650
So we got at least a
majority of the group

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:30.050
is saying that it's indeed 3.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:38.146
Now, the issue here
is that the weight

01:10:38.146 --> 01:10:40.520
of the experimental design is
working so that every three

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.540
minutes, what we're
asking is, how many Venus

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.840
molecules kind of folded in
that previous three minutes?

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.120
And then, any of
them that there are,

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.920
we count, and then we kill them.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.850
And then, the next.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:58.110
And indeed, what happened here
is that every three minutes,

01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:59.430
they're asking this question.

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.080
No proteins.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.860
And then here, they see one.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.700
Now, that's not yet
a protein burst.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.430
That's maybe a protein verse.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:12.806
But it could be that we're in
the middle of a protein burst.

01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:14.680
And indeed, what we see
is that the next time

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.000
point, the next three
minutes, we see, oh, actually,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.370
now there's two new
proteins that were produced

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.020
in that next three minutes.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.330
So indeed, this whole
thing is a protein burst.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.280
So we got 1 plus 2.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.110
So that was the calculation
I was referring to.

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:42.430
And so what they're
plotting is the distribution

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:45.682
of these different
protein burst sizes.

01:11:45.682 --> 01:11:47.140
Now, this is a
small protein burst.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.207
They see some that
get up to be 10, 15.

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:53.040
And that corresponds
to some of these cases,

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.510
where they see something
that looks, for example, more

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:04.685
like-- yeah, question?

01:12:04.685 --> 01:12:05.601
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:11.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.700
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.110
And ultimately, first
of all, the number

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:21.550
of protein bursts
per cell cycle,

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:27.690
per hour in these
conditions, is of order one.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:31.120
And then the width, the
time, of a protein burst

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.820
is five, seven minutes.

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.560
Something like that typically.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.850
So this gives you a sense of how
frequently they will overlap.

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:45.280
And indeed, what you expect
from this is that 15% of them

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.200
are actually that they see
as one burst might actually

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.710
have been two though.

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:56.170
It's also worth
mentioning that-- right.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:59.220
So what I just said is in the
model, where you know that it's

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:03.730
always just one mRNA that is
produced each time, what they

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:06.000
say is they think is that
the promoter is tightly

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.230
repressed by the Lac repressor.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.320
Ever now and then, the
Lac repressor falls off,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.580
and it's going to bind again.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.226
But some fraction of that time,
when the repressor unbinds,

01:13:18.226 --> 01:13:19.850
you get the RNA p
binding, and then you

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:21.880
get a transcription event.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.720
And I think that in
general, it is just one

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.230
mRNA that is produced there.

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:28.510
So just a single RNA polymerase
bound, and made an mRNA.

01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:30.890
But I'm sure that some
fraction of the time, it

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:33.290
was actually two that were
produced during that time.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:37.110
And those would certainly
show up as one protein burst.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.610
Right?

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:40.620
Because the lifetime of
the mRNAs in this situation

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.560
is of order what?

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.060
Yeah.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.890
It was, I think, one and
a half minutes maybe?

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.510
It was short.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.770
Yeah.

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.729
One and a half minutes.

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.520
What that means is that
on this time scale,

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.894
if there were two
mRNAs produced,

01:13:56.894 --> 01:13:59.220
they would look
like the same mRNA.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.810
But from this data
what they conclude

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:05.940
is that there's typically
only one mRNA produced

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.580
in each protein burst, and
there's not that many protein

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.350
bursts per hour of
the cell division,

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:14.500
so they won't overlap too much.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.436
But it's going to
happen at some rate.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:24.400
All right.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.340
What they see is that the
distribution of the protein

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.430
bursts-- we said
it was roughly one

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:40.720
per cell division time, which
they found was 55 minutes here.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.280
And they found that the number
of protein bursts per cell

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:49.160
cycle was distributed Poisson

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.880
So let me write
this down somewhere.

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:12.140
The number of protein
bursts per cell cycle.

01:15:14.691 --> 01:15:16.190
So this was distributed
as a Poisson

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:21.950
with mean [INAUDIBLE]
lambda of around 1.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.300
1.2.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.220
They call this n cycle.

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.250
So I'll be consistent.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:39.320
So this n cycle to the 1.2.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.860
Now, you guys-- the
Poisson is a distribution

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.810
that we're going to be spending
a lot of time thinking about.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:48.830
So the normal way
that we write it

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:57.030
is that if it's the probability
of observing some number n--

01:15:57.030 --> 01:16:00.674
and this is a number n bursts
per cycle in this case, p of n.

01:16:00.674 --> 01:16:02.090
We normally write
it as a function

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:06.540
of the mean lambda, where
it's lambda to the n over n

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.412
factorial.

01:16:07.412 --> 01:16:08.870
And then for
normalization, we have

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:11.630
to write e to the
minus lambda here.

01:16:13.839 --> 01:16:15.630
We're going to spend
a lot of time thinking

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:19.390
about the Poisson next class.

01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:21.690
So I would say that if it's
been a while since you've

01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.564
thought about probability
distributions, then

01:16:23.564 --> 01:16:26.990
you should play via
textbook, Wikipedia, whatnot,

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:32.770
with the Poisson, the
exponential, the geometric,

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.870
and also the gamma
distributions.

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.335
Because we're going to be
using those in the next class.

01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:45.310
Now, in this distribution,
what it basically

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:49.080
ends up being is that
sometimes, you see zero bursts.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.897
Sometimes you see one.

01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.230
Every now and then, you see two.

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.700
It's kind of what this means.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.880
There's one other thing that
is, I think, a bit tricky often,

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.740
which is how they calculated
that it was typically

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.520
one mRNA that led to each
of these proteins bursts.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.174
Can somebody remind us
kind of experimentally

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:20.007
what they had to do in
order to get at that?

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.720
The average RNA per cell, right.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.380
Right, so they did this RT-PCR.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.940
So what they did, they
reverse transcribed.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.320
They converted
the mRNA into DNA,

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.000
and they amplified to get a
sense of how much mRNA there

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.860
was.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:45.540
And from that, the formula,
when you first look at it,

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.070
it feels kind of mysterious,
or something like that.

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:51.350
But it's one of those
things that you just

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:55.360
have to keep track of
like, units and so forth.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.110
So you can basically think
about the number of mRNA.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:04.320
And this is indeed,
this is per cell.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.490
But cell, this doesn't
have units, right?

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:09.800
But if we wanted the
expectation value,

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.217
the number of the mRNA
that's going to be per cell,

01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:14.050
well, that's going to
be given by the number

01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:27.140
of the mRNA per burst, times the
number of bursts per unit time.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.620
So this is some rate
burst, and then also

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.280
times the lifetime of the mRNA.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.950
Now in this formula, there's
also the added factor,

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:51.650
where they have like, the
time of the cell cycle.

01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:53.380
But that's just
because this could

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:56.450
have been bursts per minute,
lifetime of mRNA minutes.

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:59.170
But then, if you want to
put in the extra term,

01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:01.650
then you have to say, oh,
the cell cycle is 55 minutes.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:03.620
So then you have to do
that conversion of time

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.843
into the proper units.

01:19:04.843 --> 01:19:06.218
So that's what
ends up happening.

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.915
Are there any questions
about what happened here?

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:31.760
Now, what we're going to do
next lecture is kind of go

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.520
through a simplified
model of gene expression,

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.680
where there's just some
rate of mRNA formation, mRNA

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.360
degradation, the mRNA makes
protein, proteins get degraded.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.275
And then in that model, we
want to try to understand

01:19:47.275 --> 01:19:48.525
how everything is distributed.

01:19:50.802 --> 01:19:52.260
And we're going to
relate that back

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.218
to some of the experimental
data in this paper.

01:19:54.218 --> 01:19:56.860
In particular, for example,
this geometric distribution

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.060
of protein burst
sizes is something

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:03.560
that you expect from the
most basic simple model

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.160
that you would
have written down.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.180
So from that same point,
it's not a surprise.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.300
It is often assumed this
thing should be geometrically

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.590
distributed, and it was.

01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:13.370
And that's wonderful.

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:15.720
From my standpoint, I think
that even things that we

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.590
assume to be true,
we should still

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:19.580
check to see if they are true.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:23.280
And in other cases, they
may not be, and so forth.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.391
Are there any questions
about this paper?

01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:27.890
No?

01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:31.540
OK.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.893
Then I will see
you our next class.

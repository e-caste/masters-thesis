00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.479
[CREAKING]

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.100
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So what we
are going to talk about today,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.390
and I'm going to do something
a little annoying, as usual,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.190
I want to take you
somewhere here.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.090
Yeah, sure, back to
carbon, that's fine.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.300
But what I want to
show you is the sizes

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.930
of the molecular
players in translation

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.220
because we are going here now
from the smallest carbon atom.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.400
And we spent the first four
lectures on amino acids,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.100
nucleotides, sugars,
phospholipids.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.568
But we're entering
new territory here,

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.360
and I'm just going to
do this in such a way

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.850
that it comes onto the screens.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.420
What you can see
here is, in order

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.300
to make proteins like
hemoglobin and antibodies--

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.260
these are made up of amino
acids, the really tiny things

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.269
that are out of view right now--

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.740
we need large entities that are
made up of either nucleic acids

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.140
alone or nucleic
acids plus proteins.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140
And so the things that
will feature today

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.480
are the transfer RNAs
and the ribosome.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.980
And I want you to look at the
size of this molecular machine.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.320
This is we're getting
pretty large now.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.930
We're needing to
use large machines

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.950
to make the smaller catalysts
that are essential in the cell.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.000
And, just so sort of maybe
size doesn't seem so important,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but let's just go a
little bit further here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.090
And what to me is intriguing is
that the size of the ribosome

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.450
is pretty similar to the
size of the rhinovirus,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.030
a little smaller than
the hepatitis virus,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.090
but quite a bit smaller than
some of these other viruses.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.960
So the ribosome organelle is
a large entity in the cell.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.930
And, when you do look at
electron micrographs of cells,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.380
you can see these dark dots,
which represent ribosomes.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.770
They're big enough to see,
whereas the proteins themselves

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.210
are not big enough to see.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.450
So that's what you're
destined for today.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.720
All right, OK, so I've
started to place on this board

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200
some of the molecular players,
the messenger RNA, the transfer

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.290
RNA, and the ribosomes,
which are made up

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.840
of ribosomal RNA plus protein.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
And I want to just remind
you about the structure

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.880
of the mature messenger
RNA just for a minute

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.680
because, in the last
class, we talked

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.750
about a lot of manipulations
of that pre-messenger RNA,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.000
the fresh thing out
of transcription.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.710
And now I just
want to remind you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.230
that the messenger is
single-stranded RNA, obviously.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.690
It has a 5 prime cap, which
has got this funky 5 prime,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.100
5 prime bridge that's
resistant to exonucleases.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.510
Somewhere in that
sequence is a start codon.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.660
It's something that says this
is the bit I want to translate.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.360
Often, there's a lot of stuff
here that you don't translate.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.440
It's part of what's known as
the ribosome binding site.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.750
And there are many
features in this part

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.410
of the sequence that are very
important for translation.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.590
They contribute to the
efficiency of translation.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.080
Generically, we'd call it
the ribosome binding site,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.350
but there are funny things
called Shine-Dalgarno sequences

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.040
and stuff.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.910
Don't worry about any of that.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.190
I just want you to appreciate
that, the mature transcript,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.620
you don't translate
the whole thing.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.230
A lot of this stuff is
structural, functional

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.210
for other reasons
that contribute

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.160
to the success of translation.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.560
Once you see one of
these, the ribosome

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.060
mows its way through and
reads the nucleic acids

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.110
in the message.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.740
So the message is being conveyed
over to the new machinery.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.640
And then, when you hit
one of these three codons,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.200
and we'll discuss these
properly when we get to them,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.230
it's time to stop and
finish translating.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.000
The other end the message
has a poly-adenine tail.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.330
Remember that, once again,
is structural to protect

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.280
the ends of that transcript.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.720
Even if some of the hundreds
of adenine nucleotides

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.810
are nibbled off, you
don't get into the part

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.050
of the gene that's
critical to be translated.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.260
At a certain stage,
though, you might get in.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.960
Exonucleases might
chew up enough.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.930
And they may end up
chewing up your transcript,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.140
but that probably suggests that
the messenger has been around

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.580
too long, and it's time for it
to retire to a better life, OK?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.840
So remember the poly-A tail.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.800
And this, once again, plays
other functional roles

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.770
with respect to being
recognized as a transcript

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.910
and being helped to
get out of the nucleus.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.980
So this was really what
we talked about last week.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.480
There's one more
feature in here.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.460
I'm just going to
remind you that

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.030
the final mature
transcript has also

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.160
been through splicing
with removal of introns

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.520
and the pasting together of
exons, which is a wonderful way

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.970
to diversify transcripts
of translation

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.590
and give you much more proteins
than one gene can encode, OK?

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.090
And we talked about
that last time.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.850
Great.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.650
So the first thing we
have to think about here

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.830
is how do we go from four
bases to a language that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.850
includes 20 letters, right?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.380
Or it's better
really, more precise,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.180
for me to call them nucleotides.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.820
It's more precise
because the base just

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.660
represents the ring system
that's attached to the ribose.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.930
Nucleotide means the whole
thing, including a phosphate.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.375
So we go from four bases
to encoding 20 amino acids.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.090
Now there are a few organisms--

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.310
and, in fact, we have one spare
one as well, selenocysteine.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.780
There are a couple
of other amino acids

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.860
that might be designated as
the so-called 21st, 22nd amino

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.670
acid.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.910
They're not found
globally in all organisms.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.960
We have selenocysteine in
just very, very few proteins.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.530
So it's something beyond
the list of 20 that you saw.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.200
There are other
organisms, for example,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.090
in archaea, these
guys who hang out

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.120
in bubbling hot
pots in Yellowstone,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.200
for example, that have
another amino acid known

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.130
as pyrrolysine.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.650
I'm going to mention that
a little bit later on,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.900
but the ones you really
need to think about

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.370
are the ones we're encoding
in the global genetic code.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.270
This is the ones that are
common to everybody, all right?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.950
So, obviously, when you look
at the language of bases,

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.690
one base--

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.960
if the language translated
directly one base

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.890
to one amino acid, we could
only encode for amino acids.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.320
So we know it's not one
base, one amino acid.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.770
And I know, at this stage, you
know that it's three bases,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.190
but let's just go through the
math or the original questions

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.830
that were sort of circulating.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.160
Like how do we go from this
language to the other language?

00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:02.120
If two bases encoded
each amino acid,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.170
we could only encode
eight amino acids.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.700
That's not enough still.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.410
16 amino-- wait a minute.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.760
16 amino acids,
sorry, I can never--

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.390
anyway, that's 4 to the 2.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.310
It's pretty good if I
can't get 4 to the 2

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.510
up at the blackboard.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.780
This would be 4 to
the 1 power and then--

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.880
so what that came
down to realizing

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.560
there were not enough.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.260
That wouldn't be a
sufficient language

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.760
to encode the 20 amino acids.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.230
So it's finally deduced
that three bases

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.400
encoded each amino acid.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:52.370
That would give us 64 possible
words in the language that

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.310
needs to be translated.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.820
That's a lot more than we need.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.150
We only need 20 for the
encoded amino acids,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.630
so 64 possibilities.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.140
But what else do we
need in the language?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.575
We need a few more
things anyway.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.605
Yeah, up there.

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:15.980
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
don't [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.680
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Oh, you weren't.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.695
Up there.

00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:20.778
AUDIENCE: You need to know
when to start and stop.

00:09:20.778 --> 00:09:23.510
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So, exactly,
so here this isn't necessarily

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.780
one of the ones that
uniformly codes amino acid

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.660
through the sequence.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.800
We need a precise
way to say start.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.190
And, in fact, we need
a way to say stop.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.950
And there are multiple three
letter words that say stop.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.120
So it turns out that
the genetic code, which

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:50.090
forms the basis of
this entire concept,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.500
has some features to it where
it does have some degeneracy.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.240
But we'll go through
the degeneracy,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.040
and we'll take a look
at the genetic code

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.555
because it will tell us
exactly how the three letter--

00:10:02.555 --> 00:10:05.570
the words made of three
bases encode everything

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.210
we need for
translation, all right?

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.120
So let's just go back
and take a look at this.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.160
So we've looked
at the messenger.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.400
I've told you a little bit about
the tRNAs and the proteins.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.650
But then we just sort
of give you a little bit

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.150
of the back history.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.700
And, once the structure
of double-stranded DNA

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.800
was deduced,
really, everyone was

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.580
moving on to trying to
understand how that converted

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.830
to the translation to proteins.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.800
And there were a lot of workers
deeply involved in this.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.550
Crick and Brenner realized
it was three bases to code

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.170
for one amino acid, but
Khorana, Nirenberg, and Holley,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.400
Khorana who was part of our
faculty for many, many years,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.250
actually defined
that genetic code

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.100
and got all of the details.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.950
Brenner and Crick started
to have the ideas,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.760
but, really, the definition
by doing a process known

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.720
as cell-free translation where
they could very carefully add

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.690
components to understand how
the code, the genetic code,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.630
was formulated where they
put in specific messenger

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.330
RNAs and amino
acids and transfer

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.570
RNAs and actually made
proteins from that.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.880
So that's the work that
Khorana and others did.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.570
And that was awarded them a
Nobel Prize for that work.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.290
And then, later on, things
started to get-- you know,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.260
these are decades of work
I want to point out to you.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.910
The ribosomes were discovered.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.240
That was a decade
later, the sort

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.390
of details of the structure,
but not the structure itself.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.450
And it was really
exciting in the 2000s

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.080
when Ramakrishnan, Steitz, and
Yonath solved the structure

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.150
of the prokaryotic ribosome.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.670
So each of these things has
taken a decade to happen,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.300
but they are fundamental,
major, important things

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.780
that we can act on and move
forward to understand more.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.220
All right, so let's move
to the transfer RNAs.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.040
And I've flashed up this
slide a couple of times,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.940
but I actually now have
the movie of the structure

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.870
of a transfer RNA.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.600
So the transfer RNA is
a linear segment of RNA,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.030
but it's folded up the
way ribonucleic acids are

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.260
with three, four stretches of
double strand coming together

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.340
and loops in between them.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.400
And the one end, this
is the 3 prime end.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.200
I always try to
draw it on the left

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.270
because, otherwise,
things get confusing.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.090
It's much easier to sort of
see where everything ends up

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.470
if you put the long
arm on the 3 prime side

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.303
to the left of your picture.

00:12:45.303 --> 00:12:46.720
And what I think
is cool, when you

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.260
look at the structure of RNA,
we think of messenger RNA

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.880
as being a sort of
rather floppy entity,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.300
but it actually
really likes to form

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.430
short segments of double helix.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.500
It just doesn't do well
with the really long

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.980
double-stranded structure
the same way that DNA does.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.950
But this folded up
structure is very important.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.300
And it was on the observation
of these folded structures

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.090
that the ribosome
hypothesis was formulated.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.540
But the two things that you want
to remember about the ribosome

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.940
are that the 3
prime hydroxyl group

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.620
of the last ribose within
this ribosomal sequence

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.920
is where the amino acid
that's going to be loaded

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.230
into your protein is attached.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.740
So that's one point.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.790
And then there's another
landmark on this structure.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.410
And that's what's called--

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.760
one of the loops
has a special name.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.300
It's called the anticodon loop.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.900
It comprises three
nucleotides that

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.970
are complementary to the
nucleotides in your messenger

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.050
sequence.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.900
So this really is a decoder
because, at one end,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.150
it's carrying an
amino acid, but it's

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.600
carrying the amino
acid that corresponds

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.830
to the code that's in the
messenger via that anticodon

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.460
loop.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.340
So it's a large structure,
but don't mistake it

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.110
for being something
that's just sort

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.300
of amino acid and anticodon.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.520
A lot goes on with the
rest of the structure.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.600
It's a very important structure
in the mechanisms of protein

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.360
translation and synthesis.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.190
OK, so here I've got to sum
that up with a couple more

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.670
of the ways that you would
see the transfer RNAs.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.890
You might see it in
this globular form.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.920
And I pointed out
the anticodon loop.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.590
The place where the
amino acid gets linked

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.110
is also called
the acceptor stem.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.020
And, up here, I show
you that linkage.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.380
And you should-- yes?

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.797
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to ask,

00:14:43.797 --> 00:14:46.885
I see how the anticodons
are specialized.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:50.443
How does the 3 prime
end of the tRNA

00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:51.610
know which protein is bound?

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.160
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yeah, and,
in a moment, not quite yet,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.710
I will show you
structures of tRNAs

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.530
bound to their
synthetases, which

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.160
are the enzymes that load them.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.000
So there is specificity
throughout that whole thing.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.890
It's not just
bystander stuffing.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.450
It's really involved.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.720
And it's a great
question, and I hope

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.150
you'll get an answer
that's reasonably satisfied

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.290
from the structure perspective.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.120
And so, if you look up
here at the acceptor stem,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.910
the amino acid is
joined by an ester bond

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.590
to the 3 prime end
of the transfer RNA,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.120
but, hopefully, you
can see in here.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.040
There's the carboxyl.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.270
There's the amine.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.900
And CHR designates
the amino acid

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.990
where R would be the side
chain of your amino acid.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.660
So that's what that looks like
at that end of the transfer

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.590
RNA.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.560
And, coming down to
the anticodon loop,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.420
you're going to read the
messenger 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.390
And the anticodon
loop, when you draw

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.670
this in this
configuration, actually

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.880
shows you that
the anticodon loop

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.730
is antiparallel
to the codon loop

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.650
to make that good
hydrogen-bonding network.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.790
So that's why I like to
be consistent in the way I

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.230
render this structure.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.195
So the anticodon loop of the RNA
complements that triplet codon

00:16:13.195 --> 00:16:15.550
in the messenger RNA, all right?

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.406
Yes?

00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:17.894
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.393
What's between the G and T?

00:16:19.393 --> 00:16:21.310
BARBARA IMPERIALI: What's
between the G and T?

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:21.810
Hold on.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.282
I'm going to-- what's
between the G and the--

00:16:25.282 --> 00:16:26.529
AUDIENCE: On the loop there.

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:27.737
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Over here?

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:28.930
AUDIENCE: No, above
that on the left.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.222
BARBARA IMPERIALI: On the left.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:32.740
Oh, this guy?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.180
So cool you ask that.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.620
So this guy is what's
known as a funny base.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.882
It's actually-- that's
the symbol for it

00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:43.840
that you've picked out.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.210
And it's a base known
as pseudouridine.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.020
And it turns out that
these unusual bases show up

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.210
in RNA sequences.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.030
Pseudouridine has an
interesting structure

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.480
where the bond to
the ribose ring

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.940
is not a carbon-nitrogen
bond, but, rather,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.960
a carbon-carbon bond.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.460
And it's a bit more stable.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.690
So, in RNA, there's some of
these other unusual bases.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.500
And pseudouridine is the most
common of the unusual ones.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.630
It can still
hydrogen bond, but it

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.869
tends to show up in these
sort of different loops

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.527
and turn-type places, OK?

00:17:24.527 --> 00:17:25.569
Thanks for noticing that.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.227
Yeah?

00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:28.060
AUDIENCE: So do you get
the G in parentheses

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.640
on the yellow part [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.960
BARBARA IMPERIALI: The G,
which is in parentheses,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.960
designates that even
those sort of bulges

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.810
between the real loops
can vary in length.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.490
So it could be more than one.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.120
So that addresses-- comes
back to that other question.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.920
But that stuff in
between has variables.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.920
It has variable bulges and
variable shapes associated

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.010
with the synthetase enzymes
that I'll introduce in a minute

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.680
that it recognizes,
all great questions.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.160
OK, all right, cool.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.290
OK, so [HUMMING]
we've got all of that.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.300
So now let's move ourselves
so we've looked at--

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.250
we know the messenger well.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.740
We're starting to
understand the tRNAs.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.960
What we need to
move on to now is

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.600
sort of the most important
part of the game, which

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.360
is really taking a look
at the genetic code.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:30.478
So this table is but one
rendition of the genetic code.

00:18:30.478 --> 00:18:32.770
Sometimes, you'll see it in
different shapes and sizes.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.560
In a second, I'll show you
one of the other renditions.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.930
But it is the absolute--

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:50.940
the sort of Rosetta
Stone for translating

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:59.460
messenger RNA to amino
acid sequence using codons.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.120
So this sort of-- whoa.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.890
Getting a little--
I love translation.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.130
I'm sorry.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.255
I'm getting a little bit
excited about translation.

00:19:07.255 --> 00:19:11.700
OK, so there are a few
features of this genetic code.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.770
Number one, you won't
have to remember it.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.960
It would be foolish for
us to think you could,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960
but there are characteristics
about the genetic code that

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.840
are very important.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.110
But, first of all, let
me sort of calibrate you.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.310
This would be the first of the
three letters in the codon.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.530
And, by the way,
the genetic code

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.440
gives you the
identities of what are

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.950
known as the codons,
which is how we designate

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.290
the triplet of nucleotides.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.680
So you'll hear a lot about
codons and anticodons

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.730
of course.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.530
So the way you read this table
is you read the first letter.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.160
So all of these begin with
U. All of these begin with C

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.240
and so on.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.710
Then you read the second letter,
and there's those designations.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.420
So, if I'm going here, here,
it's going to be starting UU.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.310
And then, within
each block, there

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.690
are the four alternatives
for the other four bases.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.120
And then the third
one, basically,

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.860
just designates those.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.450
So you can read, for each amino
acid, what three-letter codon

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.170
would correspond to it.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.850
Some people quite like--

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.110
oops.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.600
I got rid of it too fast.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.420
Some people quite like
this other rendition

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.160
where the first of the three
letters is in the center.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.120
So it's either G, U, A, or C.
Then the second one comes out.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.460
It's in the brown circle.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.650
And then the third one is the
third letter in the codon.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.640
And then that tells you what
amino acid that corresponds to.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.390
And we'll generally tend to
just stick with this one table

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.590
and stick with it.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.120
So you might as well get used
to that particular table.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.750
Now there's a couple of
characteristics in the table.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.530
The first thing to notice
is that, within that table,

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.130
there is a codon to start.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.510
And it's AUG.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.720
And the one thing that's sort
of sent to drive you crazy

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:28.960
is that AUG codon equals start,
but it also equals methionine.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.640
And, in bacteria, it equals a
modified version of methionine.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.690
So, if the ribosome is
reading the messenger RNA,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.100
it will look for the first one
of these and start reading.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.470
But, once you find another
one of these further

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.260
into the sequence, it
will put in methionine.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.640
Methionine is fairly rare.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.240
There may only be one or
two more in the protein.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.790
And I hate the illogic of
that, but, nevertheless, it

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.020
is the case.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.120
In some organisms, you start
with different amino acids,

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.800
but the most common start
is the codon for methionine

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.770
is the start.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.270
So what that means is that
every protein you translate

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.370
has a methionine at
one of the termini.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.180
Which terminus would it be at?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:20.050
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Yeah, OK, so that's

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.650
the details with methionine
and the start codon.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.500
Then there are
several stop codons.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.080
And I've shown you the
three of them there.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.050
The stop codons tend
to be used variously.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.620
Some are more predominant in
some organisms than other.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.960
And some of them
respond differently

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.090
when the process of
stopping occurs, which

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.980
we'll talk about in a second.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.930
But the next important thing to
notice about the genetic code

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.960
is that it's what's
called degenerate.

00:22:56.323 --> 00:22:57.990
Now, when you call
something degenerate,

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.323
it seems like sort of a really
nasty thing to call them.

00:23:00.323 --> 00:23:02.460
And it doesn't mean,
oh, it's so bad.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.510
It's just a degenerate.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.627
It just means it is
specific, but it's not--

00:23:08.627 --> 00:23:09.210
wait a minute.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.210
I've got the right wording
here because I always

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.390
get this sort of--

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:18.390
degenerate, ah,
it's not ambiguous.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.813
It's degenerate.

00:23:19.813 --> 00:23:20.730
That's the best thing.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.680
But it's not ambiguous.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.760
What this means
is there are all,

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.110
for several amino acids, more
than one codon that specify it.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.700
And let's take a look
at some of the examples

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.360
of that degeneracy.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.530
It's at its most
extreme with residues

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.490
such as leucine where there
are six codons that specify

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.200
leucine.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.080
Alanine has four
different codons.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.630
They all specify alanine.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.760
Lysine has two codons.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.850
And it's generally appreciated
that the residues that

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.350
have more codons tend to be the
more common in your messenger

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.310
RNAs, in your final protein
sequence, because you'll find,

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.930
in your protein,
a lot of leucines.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.550
So we need a few more codons
to stack the deck in favor

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.720
of putting in more leucines.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.610
But so it's ambiguous--

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.610
it's degenerate.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.010
But, what I mean by
it's not ambiguous,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.680
you know what it's
going to code for.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.690
The other place where degenerate
codons can become important

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.910
is that there is
species specificity.

00:24:39.582 --> 00:24:42.040
So I'm going to write that in
here and explain what I mean.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.680
And what that means is that
some organisms might prefer

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.320
two or three of the
degenerate codons,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.110
and others may prefer
a couple of the others.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.480
And what that means,
once in the laboratory,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.490
is it's really
annoying if we want

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.650
to express a protein in a really
convenient bacterial system

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.030
that we've taken from
a mammalian system.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.210
Our codon mix may
not be the same.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.490
And so there are
companies now that

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.670
actually will fix the
codons in a gene for you

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.550
to make them compatible
with a different organism

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.450
for expression.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.580
So it has huge
practical implications

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.990
to be quite honest.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.930
And it can be very
annoying in the laboratory.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:34.700
OK, and then so codon usage
varies amongst organisms.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.850
All right, so now, one
last thing, so we've

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.530
talked about the genetic code.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.220
It's the code that's going to
be embedded within the messenger

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.440
RNA.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.470
The last thing I want to do
is, basically, explain to you

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.330
one more time,
when you're looking

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.940
to read what your amino
acids that get put in

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.520
may be, you're going
to look at the codon.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.050
And it will tell you
exactly the amino acid.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.340
A long time ago, I
used to be confused

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.650
because I thought I should
be looking at the anticodon.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.422
And I was trying to
translate everything,

00:26:07.422 --> 00:26:08.380
and it was a real mess.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.690
But it's the genetic
code in that box

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.760
that I just showed
you is written down

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.480
for maximum clarity
and ease of use.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.320
So, whenever you see a
particular three-letter code

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.690
on the messenger,
you will then be

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.750
able to know what amino
acid it would code.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.320
So this is kind of interesting.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.800
It just reinforces to you that
the codon and the anticodon

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.920
are antiparallel.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.490
And so what I want to do is,
basically, in this diagram,

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.620
you would be reading from the
5 prime to the 3 prime end,

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.820
as the transfer RNAs attach
to the messenger RNA.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:51.310
And that would give you a
codon here that would be AUC.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.260
If you'd written this
the wrong way round,

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.670
it would look like CUA.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.580
So you really want to be
reading 5 prime to 3 prime

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.700
in the codon.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.990
And then you can go to your
favorite genetic code map

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.080
and say this thing is
read 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.690
And the amino acid that gets
put in is isoleucine, OK?

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:15.250
So you'll need to be able
to do that quite readily.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.780
All right, next
portion, those monster--

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.460
loading the amino acid.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.920
OK, so, as I said, this is a
many building block, many parts

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.420
thing.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.980
So we've got the transfer RNAs.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.540
We know where we load
them onto the amino acids.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.620
We know where we load the amino
acids onto the transfer RNA.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.020
But we do not know
how that is done.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.840
So I want to show you
briefly how that occurs.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.730
So let me just start by
drawing transfer RNAs the way

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:54.210
I usually draw them in a
very sort of cartoon form.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:00.450
And, to attach an amino acid to
the 3 prime end of the transfer

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.380
RNA, you have an
amino acid residue--

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.355
we're just going to go R here--

00:28:07.355 --> 00:28:10.830
carboxylic acid, amine.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.130
Actually, I'm going to draw them
in their appropriate charged

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.230
states.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.970
And what I need to be
able to do is faithfully

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:25.640
fix this amino acid to the 3
prime OH of the transfer RNA.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.250
And what we do is
we need adenosine

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:34.070
triphosphate to
activate this chemistry.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.768
And then the OH at the 3 prime
end reacts with the amino acid.

00:28:39.768 --> 00:28:41.060
So I'm just going to draw that.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.990
I'm leaving out steps because,
otherwise, it's too many,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.400
and you'll be cross with me.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.920
So you attach through an
ester to the amino acid

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.610
from the 3 prime end
of these transfer RNA.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.690
That's what's done.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.510
The ATP makes this
chemistry feasible,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.570
but there's one
more player here.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.560
And that's the enzyme that
brings them all together,

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:31.600
which is known as an
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase,

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.880
meaning it's an enzyme that
makes an aminoacyl-tRNA.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.270
And it synthetases it.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.690
So that's how its
name gets subtracted.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.370
So, with reference to an earlier
question, what I'm showing

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.010
you here are
different synthetases

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.680
for different amino
acids that show you

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.130
that there's a recognition
not just for the amino acid

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.600
that's being
loaded, but, rather,

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.100
for the entire transfer RNA.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.280
So some of these
look quite different.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.450
The isoleucine one
interacts in one way.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.580
The valine one is
a little different.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.860
And the glutamine one
is different again.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.630
So they vary in the way they
interact with the transfer

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.180
RNAs.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.750
So the transfer
RNAs are specific

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.660
for the amino acid that
is loaded onto them,

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.840
but also for the synthetase
that does the loading.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.940
That's how you get
the specificity.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.940
Does that address your
question from earlier?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.480
Hello?

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.840
OK.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840
That makes sense, right?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.760
So they fall into a lot
of different families,

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.470
but they're quite
varied when you

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.770
look at specific interactions
between the synthetase

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.110
and the amino acid.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.820
And, on those synthetases,
there will also

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.420
be specificity for
the amino acid side

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.380
chain of the amino
acid that gets loaded.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.660
Now let's look at the
ribosome components

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.390
because they're the
last big monsters.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.580
Ribosomes have a
small and a large--

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.340
that's the large
and a small subunit.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.880
They are made up, as
I mentioned over here,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:17.700
of RNA and protein, so
small and large subunits.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.220
And I've shown them there
in two different colors.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.010
The prokaryotic
ribosomes are pretty

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.170
different from the
eukaryotic ones.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.170
There's a higher
proportion of RNA

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.710
in the prokaryotic ones than
the eukaryotic ones, which

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.730
is kind of interesting.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.970
And these complexes
are so big, and they're

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.970
made up of so many
protein and RNA

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.550
strands, that we don't
so much measure them

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.860
by the number of
those components,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.470
but, rather, by what's
known as their sedimentation

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.590
coefficient, which gives
us a sense of the weight

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.120
of the module or the complex.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.455
So the small subunit--

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.850
oh, he's back [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:07.380
The small subunit would have a
30S sedimentation coefficient.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.010
The S stands for Svedberg units.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.490
It's how fast its sediments
in an ultra centrifuge.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:17.840
And the large subunit would
have a 50S sedimentation

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.920
coefficient.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.800
And those correspond to a
certain number of daltons.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.668
If you see that S
term after a number,

00:32:25.668 --> 00:32:26.960
that's what it's talking about.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.002
It's talking about the
sedimentation coefficient,

00:32:29.002 --> 00:32:31.775
which gives us a sense of
the size of the complex.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.950
And, when you start to bring
all the pieces together now,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.820
what we can see on this slide
is the messenger, the transfer

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:48.280
RNAs, and the ribosomal
all to scale in such a way

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.110
that it can really explain it.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.580
So what I show you here is
the small and large subunit.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.270
In orange-- well, that's
kind of a burnt orange--

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.030
is a sneaky little
bit of the messenger.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.640
In yellow are the transfer RNAs.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.410
And there's one
more unit on here

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.330
that I won't describe too much.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.230
It's a protein factor that
helps all the processes occur.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.610
Generally, it's thought to
help the loaded tRNA come

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.790
to the ribosome, get it in
place, and then go away.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.380
So it's some of
these extra helper

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.330
proteins that are involved.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.070
OK, so let's build
a protein because I

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.200
know it's the moment we've
all been waiting for,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.770
and we're going to walk through
how those pieces come together.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.860
It's a very clunky animation,
but I'm very proud of myself

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.340
because I did it myself.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.700
So I'm just going to show
you how these things happen,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.120
as you assemble a chunk
of polypeptide chain

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.310
from a messenger.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.450
And so here's the messenger.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.970
It's being read 5
prime to 3 prime.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.720
What happens, first of all,
is that the small subunit

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.480
kind of floats along,
looking for the place that

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.350
would be the ribosome binding
site that I mentioned here,

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.920
and then sliding its way
to position the start

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.520
codon in the right place
to start the synthesis.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.820
Once that happens,
the methionine

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.710
that's on its tRNA, the
start one, gets into place.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.370
And, at the same time,
the large subunit,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.469
completing the ribosome
complex, comes together.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:22.120
So you now have large and
small ribosomal complexes

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.600
stuck onto that messenger,
ready to carry on.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.850
And, in each case,
you're translocating

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.469
through the messenger RNA.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:34.000
And, in each step,
you're bringing in a tRNA

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.840
that's loaded with an amino
acid where the anticodon

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.350
of the amino acid-- and I've
got those little letters shown

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.610
on the bottom here--

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.460
is complementary
to the codon that's

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.420
within the messenger RNA.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.530
So we can start
building this protein.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.150
AUG is that start codon.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.190
Methionine is the
first amino acid.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.409
And it's always
at the N-terminus.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.080
Then there's another
amino acid comes in.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.550
The codon was UUU, and that
corresponds to phenylalanine.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.410
And then the next
thing that happens

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.040
is there's a movement such
that a new bond gets--

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.880
a new amide bond is formed
between the methionine

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.020
and the phenylalanine.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.920
And that new bond
is an amide bond.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.240
It's not any of the others.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.360
So you're literally intercepting
this complex on the transfer

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.488
RNA with the amine
of a new amino acid.

00:35:28.488 --> 00:35:29.780
That's how that comes together.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.160
I'm not going to worry you too
much with the chemical details,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.310
but a lot of them have
been illuminated by having

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.270
the structure of the ribosome.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.980
And it shows you, in fact,
that it's not proteins that

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.570
are catalyzing that reaction.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.170
It's nucleic acids.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.150
So now I'm just going to move
you on through the synthesis,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.560
in each case, building
that polypeptide chain

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.770
and then moving, translocating.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.640
This guy leaves.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.080
The ribosome moves along.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.980
This was a good Saturday
afternoon's work.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.923
We've got to use
up all those tRNAs.

00:36:07.923 --> 00:36:10.090
It doesn't get interesting
until you get to the end.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.440
So we're using them, but now
we come and hit a stop codon.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.910
We have UAG.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.410
So what happens here?

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.460
The whole process slows
down because you can either

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.630
load what's known as
a suppressor tRNA--

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.300
that's the one, the magenta
one, that went up there--

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.710
or a protein release factor
can come in and bind.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.250
But, in either case, there's
no new amino acid to come in,

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.850
and translation
finishes and releases

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:44.170
the protein in
its complete form.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.780
Now the reason I
want to differentiate

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:51.160
between the release
factor and an RNA that

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.070
has the complementary
stop codon is

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.240
because the RNAs that are
known as the suppressor RNAs

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.670
have now been
completely hijacked

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.550
to make an enhanced
genetic code where

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.970
we can load lots of
different amino acids using

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.650
the suppressor RNAs.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.050
And, if anyone would like
to chat to me about this,

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.990
I'd love to because I think
it's a fascinating field,

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.110
but it's a bit
beyond the scope of.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:20.290
OK, so this entire
process took the following

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.010
where you've got small and large
subunits, all the elongation

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.950
factors and initiation
and release.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.630
And then, in each
case, the energy

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.850
is actually not provided by ATP.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.890
It's provided by GTP.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:37.120
But where ATP is important
is in loading the amino acids

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.290
onto the transfer RNAs.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.780
This occurs at about a rate
of 20 amino acids per second,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:49.210
meaning you're reading about
60 bases per second, which

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:52.750
is pretty consistent with
the rate of transcription,

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.250
not the rate of replication.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.380
That's far faster.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.400
OK, sometimes, when you're
making a lot of a protein,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.920
you will see that ribosomes
line up on the messenger RNA.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.600
And you'll have
many proteins being

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.600
made at once and at
different stages in the game.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.810
And this is a lovely electron
micrograph that actually

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.970
shows this process in action.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.150
And, when you have a lot of
ribosomes on one messenger,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.560
we call them polysomes.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.760
They have that name.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.980
OK, good, all right, so
what I want to do now-- so

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.390
does everyone feel
good about how

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.530
you translate a messenger into
a protein and the various moving

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:33.490
parts?

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.070
You would always know the
amino acid structures,

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.630
have the genetic code.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.850
Just be familiar with
reading it and making

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.030
sure you could pick out
which amino acid might

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.590
be incorporated in response
to which particular codon.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.020
So, when proteins are
made on the ribosome,

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.500
they have a bit of a choice.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.920
They can get made
and fold beautifully

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.930
into active proteins.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.570
Those proteins
could be modified.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.520
They could go to different
places in the cell.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.010
Occasionally, proteins misfold.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.380
Maybe the rate of
synthesis is too fast,

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.240
or the environment isn't right.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.750
So there will need to be
mechanisms whereby proteins

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.660
get degraded if they're
not folded properly,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.610
but that's the story
for another day.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.880
It's not always perfect,
but what is known now

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.940
is that, as proteins are
emerging from the ribosome,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.000
they're starting to
fold almost immediately

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.790
from that N-terminus
to, ultimately,

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.800
attain their compact shape.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.300
The last thing I
want to talk to you

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.090
about today is
what happens-- what

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.640
are the types of errors
we get in translation.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.170
Now translation, like
transcription and regulation,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.470
has some editing
mechanisms to fix errors,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.590
but, occasionally, there
are errors in the DNA that

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.750
put different amino acids.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.190
And the editing at that stage,
by the way, to fix errors

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.010
is editing when you've
loaded the wrong amino acid

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.690
onto a tRNA.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.190
But what happens when the
DNA message, the DNA starting

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.550
point, is wrong, which means
the messenger is wrong,

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:11.320
which then means we get a
different translated proteins?

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.800
So I'm just going to give
you a couple of terms here.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.740
When we have here-- and,
on all these slides,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.320
I'm going to show you
the double-stranded DNA.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.900
I'm going to show you the
messenger that gets made

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.460
and the protein
that comes forward.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.090
And they're all lined up so you
can follow them really nicely,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.270
always writing 5 prime
to 3 prime, except when

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.950
we have double-stranded
because we

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.830
have to put the bottom
strand in a different order.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.220
First of all, this
entire chunk would

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.840
be called the reading frame.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.350
It's the portion
of DNA that's going

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:48.115
to be read and transcribed
into the messenger RNA.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.733
And, when you look
at the two strands,

00:40:52.733 --> 00:40:54.400
you're going to have
to figure out which

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.560
one is the template strand.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.580
And you would figure that out
by knowing that you read 3 prime

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.720
to 5 prime, but that you
transcribe 5 prime to 3 prime,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.220
right?

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.150
So you could recognize
which of the two strands

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.470
you're going to make
the messenger out of.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.780
Once you get the messenger,
you come straight

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.750
to the genetic code because
you can use the genetic code

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.340
to translate each of these.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.810
Does that make sense?

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.250
So this would be
a situation where

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.990
you have a wild-type enzyme.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.520
Everything is transcribed
and translated properly.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.620
Occasionally, though,
there are errors

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.530
that will introduce defects
into the ultimate protein.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.480
The first type of error
is a nonsense mutation,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.530
which might be leaving
out a base pair,

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.870
inserting one, substituting one.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.650
And this would,
ultimately, cause an error

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:52.760
in the DNA that then causes
an error in the messenger RNA.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.620
So let's say we
delete by mistake,

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.720
or we're missing
the C-G base pair.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.520
Then the messenger
RNA is now different.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.430
And a lot of the base
pairs-- the bases slide up

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.700
to fill the gap.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.560
So we have what's known
as a frame-shift mutation.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.260
We've shifted things.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.890
And what we've done by doing
that is introduce wrong codons.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:21.670
So the first codon
was read properly.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.210
The next one was read
properly, even though there

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:29.050
was a mistake, but then, all of
a sudden, we get in this mess

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:32.410
where one of the later
codons carries a mistake

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:34.580
and becomes a stop codon.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.220
OK, does everybody see that?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.730
So that would be called a
frame-shift mutation that

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.260
introduces a nonsense
mutation and puts a stop codon

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.510
into your messenger RNA, OK?

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.270
The next types of
mistakes are ones

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.880
that are what are
called silent mutations.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.900
It doesn't matter, for
example, if you made an error

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.790
in the DNA, which ended up with
an error in the messenger RNA,

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:07.420
if you still code the
same amino acid, right?

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.620
I go to the genetic code.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.690
I'm like, oh my goodness,
I've got a mutation.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.800
Oh, it's fine.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.430
CCC codes for proline, but
CCA also codes for proline.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.970
So that's called a
silent mutation, OK?

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.080
Then the last ones
are the ones where

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.350
we start to encounter
errors in DNA that

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.530
result in errors in
proteins that may cause

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.580
genetically inherited diseases.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.040
So let's take a look at that.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.090
Here it's a missense
mutation where

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.220
we've got an error
in the DNA, which

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.130
has resulted in an error
in the messenger RNA.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.800
So, instead of valine--

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.410
instead of leucine,
we've put in valine.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.380
That's not so bad
because it's quite what

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.420
we would call conservative.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.650
They're sort of
similar amino acids.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.620
They have similar personalities.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.340
So this is a missense
mutation, but it

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.810
doesn't cause any dramatic
changes, probably, in the DNA.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.370
And then the last
one I want to show

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:11.840
you is a missense mutation
that is non-conservative

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.070
and causes a serious defect.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.150
And this takes you back to
the beginning of the class

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.940
where we've put a
mistake in the sequence

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.045
where we've changed a
glycine to an arginine.

00:44:23.045 --> 00:44:24.620
And that's a big change.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.210
And I just want to remind you
of the situation in hemoglobin

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:33.140
when we had a missense mutation,
and we incorporated a valine

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.560
instead of a glutamic acid,
just through one change

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.920
in the DNA, which made one
change in the messenger, which

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.340
put a drastic change in the
protein that caused sickle cell

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.570
anemia.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.070
So missense mutations
are where you

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.050
put in the wrong amino acids.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.410
And those are the ones where
you end up, in a lot of cases,

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.520
with inherited diseases.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.550
Nonsense mutations
are not so bad

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.040
because you probably just
truncate the protein.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.640
You don't-- nonsense mutations
aren't so bad because you end

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.150
up with a truncated protein,
which would be degraded.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.317
The missense mutations
are the more serious ones

00:45:09.317 --> 00:45:11.400
because you end up with a
full length protein that

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.110
might have a mistake in it.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.570
And then that would
affect the function.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.620
Am I being clear
enough to everyone?

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.120
Yeah?

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:18.620
Good.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.440
OK, I am going to tell you
that I'm handing over the baton

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.350
to my colleague,
Professor Martin.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.270
He'll take over on Monday.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.680
Mouse is pretty happy.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.630
He's pretty excited
about genetics.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.770
And these will be the
lectures that will occur.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.270
What?

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.830
You haven't seen him, have you?

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.962
He's keen on genetics, yeah.

00:45:36.962 --> 00:45:37.848
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:45:37.848 --> 00:45:39.390
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
OK, and that's it.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:43.350
Don't forget my office hours
on Monday if you need them.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:44.850
I think this field
is fascinating.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.160
Once you get used to
the mechanics of it,

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.160
it's really cool to think
of how you go from DNA

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.390
to RNA to folded proteins.

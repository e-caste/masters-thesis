00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.670
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.380
In this video what
I'd like you to do

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.660
is work on proving
the following product

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.970
rule for the del operator.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.870
So we're going to let
capital F be a vector field

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.940
and u be a scalar function.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.030
And we want to show the
product rule for the del

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.620
operator which--
it's in quotes but it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.510
should remind you of the product
rule we have for functions.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.690
And it is that del dot
the quantity u times

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.490
F-- so u is the scalar function
and F is the vector field-- is

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:43.310
actually equal to the gradient
of u dotted with F plus u

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.510
times del dot F. Where F
again is the vector field.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.375
So why don't you take a
moment to prove this fact

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.250
and you can pause the
video while doing that.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.707
And then when you're ready
to check if your solution is

00:00:57.707 --> 00:01:00.290
correct, bring the video back
up and I'll show you what I did.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.270
OK, welcome back.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.960
Again what we wanted
to do is prove

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.901
this sort of pseudo product
rule for the del operator.

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.400
And what we're doing
is we're trying

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.900
to see what happens if
you have a vector field

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.210
and you multiply it
by a scalar function

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.897
and you apply the
del operator to that.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:26.730
So we're going to see
if we actually come up

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.813
with what we should on the
right-hand side, which,

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.330
since I'm calling it a
rule, we really hope we do.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.570
In fact, we will.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.060
So let me start off.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.830
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write symbolically

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.722
what the left-hand side means.

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.680
And then we're going to
break it up into pieces

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.700
and show you get, in
fact, what you would

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.350
get on the right-hand side.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.000
So symbolically,
what do we have?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.590
Oh actually, first
I'm going to call F--

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010
the components of F,
as is usually done

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.550
in lecture--
capitals P, Q, and R.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.270
So those will be
the components of F.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.100
That's how we've been
denoting this, usually.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
And notice that if we wanted
F to be a vector field in two

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.310
dimensions, we'd just
make R 0, and then we'd

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.954
have a vector field
in two dimensions.

00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:09.884
So we can certainly
do that if we want,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:11.800
but we're going to prove
it in a little more--

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.720
in the three-dimensional case.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.970
So remember that del dotted with
any vector field is supposed

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.010
to be-- symbolically, what was
written was you should think

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.050
about this as del, del x, comma
del, del y, comma del, del z,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.120
dotted with this
vector field, u*F.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.370
Now what is this vector field?

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.120
Because u is a scalar, when I
multiply u by the vector field

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.520
F, the components are going to
be u capital P comma u capital

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.620
Q comma u capital R. So
those are my components.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.120
Now symbolically,
this is what we've

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.920
seen when we're looking at the
del operator acting on a vector

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.440
field.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.719
So what do we actually do?

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.260
Well, what we actually
do, of course,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.150
is we take the x derivative
of the first component,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.380
we take the y derivative
of the second component,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.130
and we take the z derivative
of the third component.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.080
And then we add those together.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.210
So it's really a symbolic
idea of a dot product.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.410
It's not a true
dot product here.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.530
But let's actually write
down what we get there.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.050
We get del del x of
the quantity u*P,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.610
plus del del y of the
quantity u*Q plus del del z

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.330
of the quantity u*R. That's
exactly what this symbolically

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.210
means is this, what I've
written in the next line down.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.390
So maybe I should
write equals again.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.300
This is another equals.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.090
The top thing equals
the next line down,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.173
equals the next line down.

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:47.870
And just to have it nice and
even I'll put the equals there,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.890
so when we look back
it's easy to see.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.320
Now how do I deal with this?

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.170
Well, notice that u is a
function and P is a function.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.020
Why is that?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.120
Because P was a component
of a vector field.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.727
So it is just a function that
is in the first component

00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:04.560
of the vector field.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.230
P, Q, and R are all
individually functions

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.920
that depend on x, y, and z.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.210
So here, at this
step, I can actually

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.060
take the regular product
rule we have for functions.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.980
And I can do it in this
one, this one, and this one.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.586
And what I'm going to do, so I
don't have to write del del x

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:23.960
and del del y all
over the place,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.680
I'm going to use the subscripts
notation for derivatives.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.970
So I'm going to write,
what this actually

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.410
equals is u sub x
times P plus u P sub x.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.010
So here, the del del x is now
corresponding to a subscript.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.830
So notice that I've just used
the product rule on functions

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.530
at this step, because u is a
function and P is a function.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.130
I can do the same thing for
the y derivative of u*Q.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.869
I get u sub y Q plus u Q sub y.

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:02.160
And then the last component,
I do the same thing for z.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.680
I get u sub z R plus u R sub z.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.850
Now if I made a mistake it
will become very apparent

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.730
in the next moment.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.874
But I don't think
I made a mistake.

00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:15.540
I want to remind us
where we want to go,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.790
and then we'll see if we
have the pieces to get there.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.950
So I'm going to go back over
to the side we have over here.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.430
And I want to remind
you, we started off

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.600
with a del operator acting on
this vector field u times F,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.750
capital F. And what
we'd like to see

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.090
is if we can get this to
equal the gradient of u

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.650
dotted with the vector
field plus u times

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.150
the del operator acting on F.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.910
So let's see if
we can first find

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.890
components of the vector
field and components

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.251
of the gradient of u.

00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:46.500
And let's see where those are.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.170
They're actually very
nicely placed here.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.750
Notice that this
underlined component

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.520
is the first component
of gradient u

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.880
and the first component of F.
And this underlined component

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.100
is the second component
of gradient of u

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.740
and the second component of
F. And this third underlined

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.660
component here is the
third component of grad u

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.310
and the third component of F.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.120
So if I take those three
components together--

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.980
I'm going to write
the equals up here--

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.292
I get exactly grad
u dotted with F.

00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:18.500
That's the first thing I get.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.660
And then I'm going to
see what else I get.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.550
But let me just make sure you
understand, look at these three

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.010
underlined components together.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.890
You get u sub x times P plus
u sub y times Q plus u sub z

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.240
times R. Well, [u x, u y, u z]
is the gradient vector field

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.180
for u, and [P, Q, R] is
F. So when I dot those,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.520
I get exactly u_x*P
plus u_y*Q plus u_z*R.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.050
You notice these two, or
the dot product of this,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.040
gives you those
three components.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.660
And now there are three
components remaining.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.860
Notice what they
all have in common.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.740
They all have a u
in the first spot.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.050
And then it's
multiplied by P sub x,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.160
and then here it's
multiplied by Q sub y,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.750
and here it's
multiplied by R sub z.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.340
But that is exactly-- P sub
x plus Q sub y plus R sub

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.627
z is exactly the del operator
acting on this vector field F.

00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:18.460
So this is something
you've seen previously.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.305
So I'm going to do
these as squiggles.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:30.690
That's exactly equal to u times
the del operator of this vector

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.410
field F.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.190
So again let me remind
you, del dot F actually

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.260
is going to give you P sub
x plus Q sub y plus R sub z.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.820
And then if I multiply that
by a u, I get this u in front.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.980
So what I have done is
for an arbitrary function

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.220
u-- I guess I've assumed
that function had

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.820
first derivatives so that
I could do all this stuff--

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.610
and for a vector field
that had first derivatives,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.720
I showed that if I take
the del operator of u times

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.060
the vector field, I actually
get the gradient of u

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.690
dotted with the vector
field plus u times

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.220
the del operator of
the vector field.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.757
So that is what
I wanted to show.

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.340
If you remember,
what I wanted to show

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.520
was exactly that sort of pseudo
product rule for this del

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.900
operator.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.894
So I think that that
is where I'll stop.

00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:21.310
I'm going to step
off to the side,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.380
so you can see it all
again, for a moment.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.940
But that's it.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.410
So that's where I'll stop.

JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
So today, what I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.590
want to do is, as requested
and promised last week,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.770
today we'll spend some time just
reviewing some of the things

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.250
we've talked about up until
now and some of the concepts

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
that you might find
questions around on the quiz.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
So maybe I'll ask you guys,
just to make sure you understand

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.430
each of the key concepts.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.110
I'll also, as part
of this review,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.060
we'll look at a
couple of questions,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.820
a couple more questions,
from last year, from the quiz

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.670
last year.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.782
You have a practice
quiz and in solutions,

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:08.490
and that would be a
good idea to look at.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.800
Those are posted on
Stellar, as well.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.440
That's not to say that
that's exactly what you're

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.110
going to get.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.120
But you might get-- in terms
of topics, those are good ones.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.910
But what's not on
the practice quiz

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.060
is sort of any pictures of a
density of states or a band

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.170
structure.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.470
I can almost
guarantee you you'll

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.690
have sort of one of each
of those on the real quiz.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.430
So you'll have a band
structure that I'll

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.920
ask you some questions
about, as well as a DOS plot.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.880
So we're sort of
supposed to be here.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
And I still hope to
get to solar cells.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.090
And we have time, so we're
going to talk about solar cells.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.980
But I know that, since
the quiz is Thursday,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.522
we want to take a
good chunk of today

00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:59.820
and just make sure that we
have a good sense of what

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.580
to expect and do a review.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.830
But I hope to get
to our beginning

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.009
of talking about modeling
solar cells today, as well.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.530
And we'll pick up on
that after the quiz.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.380
Are there any questions
just about the quiz, which

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.540
is Thursday?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.570
It's open book, open
notes, no phones, PDAs.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.351
Yeah?

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.460
AUDIENCE: How many
questions can we expect?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.990
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Somewhere--

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.005
definitely no more
than 100, and--

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.242
[LAUGHS] I'm kidding.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.688
10-- I don't know.

00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:41.730
Does that sound about
right, something like that?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.670
12.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.460
OK, so there we are.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.100
Now, I do want to,
since Lynn already

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.050
made a little
announcement about part 2,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.145
I wanted to start today--

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.520
so that's what
we're going to do.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.640
I wanted to just, even though
I just postponed the piece

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.130
that-- oh, I'm going to have an
office hour tomorrow at 4:00.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.930
Is that what I
said, 4:00 to 5:00?

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.490
Or did I say 5:00 to 6:00?

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.040
4:00 to 5:00, I think.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.290
But if anybody has questions,
as always, send me an email.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.100
And I'm happy to answer
electronically or set up

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.010
a time to meet that
works on your side.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.650
So that's very good.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.980
And how many of you have
looked at problem 3?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.140
A couple of you, OK.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.820
So are there any questions
that anybody has about problem

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.450
3 right now who
have looked at it?

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.900
Go ahead.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.108
AUDIENCE: Well, in terms of--

00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:51.253
how do you find
maximum efficiency?

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:52.920
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
All right, [LAUGHS]

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.130
that's a good question.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.130
That's a really good question.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.937
Anything more specific?

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.645
AUDIENCE: You know
the maximum efficiency

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.690
is going to be related
to the energy going

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.610
in versus going out.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.077
But how do you determine, I
guess, the energy going out?

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:10.160
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.770
Yeah.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.810
OK, so let me talk a little bit
about this problem to make sure

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.709
that we kind of know
where to go with it.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.620
And the key setup here
is actually really

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.880
part A, in a way.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.010
It seems pretty simple.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.350
But it's kind of the
core piece of information

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.330
that you need to understand.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.730
And I'm going to use
this yellow chalk that's

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.060
actually white to draw.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.400
Let's not forget what it is
that we're talking about,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.100
which is basically
an energy landscape.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.492
Remember, in capturing
the sun's energy,

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:48.200
what we're trying to--
what we're doing--

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.530
and in many energy
technologies, what we're doing

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.170
is we're pumping something
up an energy hill.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.290
And in this case,
we pump an electron.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.580
We shine light on it.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.270
And the molecule is
in the trans state.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.920
And then it gets excited
because the light, the electrons

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.640
from the photons from
the light, excite

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.190
electrons in the molecule.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.240
So that's that pumping
action that's happening.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.760
You're pumping electrons
within this molecule

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.590
up to a higher level.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.750
When you do that,
the molecule is

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.740
allowed to go to here just from
that energy from the light.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.480
So the light's energy
is being converted

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.960
into creating electrons
that are higher in energy.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.740
And that allows the molecule
to go from this structure

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.730
to this structure.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.870
And that's allowing you
to store this much energy.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.920
So don't forget this picture as
you think about this homework,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.630
because this homework is
all about this picture.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.560
Now, who can tell me-- we
talked about this in class

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.220
already when we talked about
this whole solar thermal fuel

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.720
concept.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.350
Who can tell me why--

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.930
who can tell me the
answer to part A?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.680
Let's just see if we
can do that together.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.330
Yeah?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.040
AUDIENCE: Is it because
there's a energy [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.126
between the trans and
the cis states that's

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:31.960
higher than natural cis energy?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.450
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
OK, so here I'm going.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.560
I'm shining light, and I
shined light of this energy--

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.300
or if you want to
think about it as HC

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.780
over lambda of that
amount of energy,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.210
just going between
wavelength and frequency.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.790
And I shined light
on this trans state,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.740
and I only shined light
with this amount of energy.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.350
Can it possibly be
converted to here?

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.490
It can't, because we can't--

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.515
now, some of you
took 3.012, and you

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:08.350
know we don't violate the
laws of thermodynamics.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.380
Those are untouchable.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.930
You can't get something
for nothing, right?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.870
So you're not going to get to
store this much energy if you

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.360
only put in this much.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.270
That kind of makes sense.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.040
You can't put it
up on some shelf

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.140
of energy, some
chemical shelf, which

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.810
is a way of thinking about
this, if you haven't given

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.730
it enough to get up there--

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.772
unless you use a lot of thermal
vibrations, but that's not what

00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:36.480
we're doing here.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.590
You could use heat.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.260
But you can't get it with
this input less than output.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.210
OK, so that's sort of
what part A is asking.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.670
Does everybody see that?

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.350
Now, here comes the fun part.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.680
But, you see, it's not just--
this is the molecule sort

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.510
of going about its business.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.930
This is the
happy-go-lucky molecule.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.510
But then we have the sun.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.290
We have this part.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.890
Where does this come from?

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.400
Well, this is the sun, you see.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.790
And that has its
thing that it does.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.710
And its thing that it does
is it has intensity that

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.280
comes in as a function of--

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.610
this has probably nothing
to do with the real curve,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.910
but I draw the sun's intensity
different every time I draw it.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.160
But this would be, say--

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.990
well, this could be energy
or wavelength or frequency.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.049
Let's call it energy.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.280
And so you have a dependence of
intensity of the sunlight that

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.320
strikes the Earth
or the atmosphere--

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.090
those are different--

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.390
on the energy that you get.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.790
So there's some
energies of light

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.090
that have a lot of intensity
and some that have very little.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.060
Now, what's the key connection
here between these two?

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.890
Who remembers?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.090
Which is really what
part 2 is about,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.730
question 2 is about-- what's
the key connection here

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.360
between this curve
and this picture?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.330
Yeah?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.280
AUDIENCE: So only photons
with a sufficient energy

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.435
will be able to excite your
molecule from the trans

00:09:18.435 --> 00:09:19.520
to cis states.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.420
So only some part of
that curve with energy

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.770
greater than or equal to delta
H will be able to do that.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.100
So it can only capture that
much of the sun's total energy?

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.090
And there's something else, too.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.750
But that's exactly what
we need for a problem 3.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.970
That's exactly it.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.850
So what I've told you--

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.990
what we did already
is we said, well,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.720
you can't get more energy
out than you put in.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.170
So you've got to
have at least delta

00:09:52.170 --> 00:10:03.850
H. Minimum of sun's
energy is delta H. That's

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.270
the absolute minimum you have
to put into this to get delta H

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.010
stored, right?

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.510
Sorry, that's kind
of hard to read.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.410
I'm not liking this
yellow-colored white chalk,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.990
because it's too thick.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.750
So the minimum sun's energy is--

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.560
that's better-- is delta H.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.800
But you see, there's also
now-- what happens is--

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.690
so let's say I can--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.688
let's say that delta
is somewhere here.

00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:37.230
I don't know.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:45.090
Call it one electron volt. well,
what I've just said in part A

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.800
is that anything below that,
anything below one electron

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.280
volt, cannot be used
to store energy.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.500
So any sunlight energy
that's below that is wasted.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.860
It's not going to do
anything to charge that fuel,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.690
because it's below this amount.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.850
On the other hand,
everything above that

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.500
will charge the fuel.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.930
But now here's where the
question of efficiency

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.220
comes in, because is it really--

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.650
what would I really
like to do here

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.790
in terms of charging this fuel?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.600
Somebody tell me the difference
between a photon of sunlight

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.150
energy that's here,
that charges the fuel,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:42.020
versus one that's out here
that also charges the fuel.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.050
Somebody tell me what's
different or similar

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.190
between those two parts of
the spectrum, both of which

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.040
convert my fuel.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.690
Yeah?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.240
AUDIENCE: The one that's higher
energy has less energy wasted,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.963
because delta H is constant.

00:11:58.963 --> 00:12:01.130
So once you get above it,
the more above it you get,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.500
the less efficient it becomes.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.860
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.720
Exactly.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.120
So I can charge the fuel
now because, I said,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.000
I can't have less than
how much I'm storing.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.550
That's a rule but
I can charge you

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.635
with anything above that
except for one thing

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.510
that I'm going to tell
you about in a second.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.052
Or you're going to
tell me, because I

00:12:19.052 --> 00:12:21.800
know somebody knows this.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.110
But if I use this amount
of energy from the sun,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.090
well, I still only stored that.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.540
That's my delta H. So that
means I wasted a whole lot.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.820
And that's what I
want you to tell me.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.870
What's the efficiency?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.150
So if I'm all the way down
here, you can say, well--

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.150
and this is what we talked
about in the lecture.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.920
If I'm all the way
down here, then I

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.620
can absorb all this light
and use it to convert.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.140
But light up here
is really wasted.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.630
It's super wasted the
further you get up in energy.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.760
So where is the sweet spot?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.340
There's going to
be a sweet spot.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.160
That's what I want you
to tell me in part B, OK?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.480
Now, there's something
I'm not telling you

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.930
which is really
important here that's not

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.985
part of that question.

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:12.610
But there's something
else that matters

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.800
a lot that's part of part B--

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.570
number 2, question number 2.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.770
What have we not considered yet?

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.410
And in particular,
what about it?

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.190
AUDIENCE: Gap.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.780
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
The band gap.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.420
The gap, or the gap
of the molecule--

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.030
and you see, because that's
the other component here.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.480
So these are--
problem 3 is talking

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.650
about theoretical limits based
on how much the molecule stores

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.020
and how much sunlight
shines on it.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.640
But there's this other thing
that problem 2 talks about,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.330
which is the fact that the
molecule will not absorb

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.370
any light lower than its gap.

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:53.880
And that's why
those two problems

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.650
are very I think
complementary to one another.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.450
So all of that comes into play.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.330
So even if I say,
well, it stores in EV,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.690
so theoretically, it
could absorb all of this.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.910
Actually, if its gap is 2
EV, it's only absorbing this.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.550
But we're not talking about the
gap in problem number 2, OK?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.050
All right.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.600
It's fun.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.430
This is fun, right?

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.866
Any questions?

00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:26.430
We're integrating the sun.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.120
Any questions
about that problem?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.620
Yeah?

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.460
AUDIENCE: So to find the
energy that's lost, do we just

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.880
have to subtract the
delta H energy from all

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.930
of the high-energy states
and integrate that new area?

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.930
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah,
it seems to me like--

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:48.030
so you figured out in
the earlier problem

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.420
how to figure out that,
if you integrated this,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.940
you would get, like, how
much of the sun's energy

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.350
that molecule is absorbing.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.170
And you used the band
gap as the cutoff.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.670
But now it seems
like maybe you want

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.420
to use delta H in a
similar way, because you're

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.390
looking at sort of a
theoretical efficiency

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.930
and ignoring the gap.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.510
Now, then, what
is the efficiency?

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.710
Well, it's how much
energy that molecule

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.060
can take in from the sun--

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.568
divided by that, the
amount that is stored.

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:30.120
Did I answer your question,
or did I dance around it?

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.207
Was that helpful?

00:15:35.207 --> 00:15:36.790
AUDIENCE: How do
you, like, physically

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.060
calculate that amount?

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.560
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Ah, but
that's what you-- you chose it.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.352
You just picked it.

00:15:41.352 --> 00:15:43.110
You said, I'm going
to say it stores 1 EV,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.152
because that was delta H.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.445
AUDIENCE: But if there's
one of these per--

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:47.862
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Per molecule.

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:52.295
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:52.295 --> 00:15:53.670
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Per molecule

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.720
is the way to think
about it, right?

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.950
And then there's-- so that's
how much energy you're storing

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.860
in each molecule, and then each
molecule is getting how much

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.370
energy from the sun?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.330
Right?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.320
And between those, you
have an efficiency.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.260
It's basically 1
divided by the other.

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.000
And you know which one
to divide by the other,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.250
because if you divide it,
and it's more than one,

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.770
you should do it the other way.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.900
That's a hint.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.250
No, but seriously, are there--

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.720
did that make sense enough?

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.620
OK.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.025
Now, question C
is a little bit--

00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:41.400
taking that a
little bit further.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.664
But it's that same
exact concept that--

00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:52.820
yeah, OK.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.080
Any questions?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.948
Yeah?

00:16:56.948 --> 00:16:58.860
AUDIENCE: I'm just
a little confused.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.240
So when we calculate
the band gap,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.150
that's the amount of
energy needed for it

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.744
to absorb energy from the sun.

00:17:06.744 --> 00:17:07.869
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.815
AUDIENCE: Then how does
that relate to the delta H?

00:17:10.815 --> 00:17:11.770
Are those separate?

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.359
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah,
that's a great, great question.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.290
And that really is--

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:25.589
I want you to think about them
separately for this problem.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:29.420
So they really are,
of course, intertwined

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.170
in fairly complicated ways.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.360
But here, what I
want you to do is

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.300
suppose you could
just make the gap.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.768
At any delta H, you could
just make it equal to delta H.

00:17:43.768 --> 00:17:45.310
That's really what
you're doing here,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.760
because you're taking a
kind of theoretical limit

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.610
exercise in this.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.760
That's not the case.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.100
It's not as tunable as that.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.980
Although, you can tune
the gap in these materials

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.870
to quite an extent.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.650
But here I'm saying, suppose
that the amount it absorbs

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.990
is, in fact, set not by the gap
but by this other constraint

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.300
that is part A of
this question, which

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.550
is that you just can't
convert it unless you

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.850
have as much as delta H.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.740
That's just-- that
there's no way around.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.000
You can't tune around that.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.720
That's just it.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.460
You can't get to here unless
enough energy from the sun

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.800
is this or more.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.630
So that's really
ignoring the gap.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.710
But in reality, it's going
to only absorb photons

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.250
at the gap or higher.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.530
But if you found it--

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.210
now, if you were to
happen to do 3B and get

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:48.630
a maximum in a
curve, let's suppose,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.940
and that maximum occurred
at a certain delta H,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.940
then you might say, well,
that's where I should try

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.240
to get my gap to that point.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.755
That might be some guidance.

00:18:59.755 --> 00:19:01.880
Of course, that's not
actually what you want to do.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.140
But as we ignore the gap, you
can think about it that way.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.210
It provides some guidance
into where you might look at--

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.240
these kinds of exercises
in theoretical efficiencies

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.930
can always be useful
for those reasons.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.287
Does that answer your question?

00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:20.610
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.110
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Definitely, I'm

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.730
very happy to talk
about this more.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.028
Office hours, tomorrow at
4:00 and also by request--

00:19:28.028 --> 00:19:29.070
so just send me an email.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.460
Or if you-- I think a lot of you
know, if you send me an email,

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.260
I'll try to write
back pretty quickly.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.280
So if you have questions,
I'm happy to answer.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.280
Are we feeling good?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.780
Yeah.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.997
OK.

00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:48.330
Nope, we're not going to look
at a recommendation letter

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:48.900
together.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.072
[LAUGHTER] That
wouldn't be appropriate.

00:19:52.072 --> 00:19:57.240
[LAUGHS] Wait a second.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.360
But there was-- yeah, let's
get that out of there.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.330
And there was a--

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.730
aha, here we go.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.090
What did you do?

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.940
Now, this is not
this year's quiz.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.070
But this is last year's quiz.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.600
And I'll do this first,
because then we can review.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.330
So here's a couple of questions
from last year's quiz.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.650
Let's just focus on this one.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.380
Oh, what are basis
functions, and how

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.210
do if you have enough of them.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.440
Somebody answer
that for me first.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:43.090
What are basis functions, and
how do if you have Enough yeah

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.550
AUDIENCE: So basis
functions are a set

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.250
of functions which you
can take combinations

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.520
of to create an approximation of
what the exact function should

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.330
be.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.490
And you know you
have enough of them

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.170
if whatever you're
trying to calculate

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:02.680
you use basis set and then a,
I guess, more refined basis

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.240
and do this a little bit.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.625
And it sort of
converges to some value.

00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:07.750
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.250
Exactly.

00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:12.680
There's a really
important part of that.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.050
So that is-- basis functions
are mathematical functions--

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:22.840
Gaussians, exponents,
plane waves, wavelets.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.100
Don't use wavelets.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.450
But they're kind of funny.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.560
They're neat functions.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.730
But it can be anything.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.700
It's just a function.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.020
And you just use them.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.140
You use a series of them
usually, a sequence of them

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.560
that you add together, to
make up the complexity that

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.612
is psi, which is
the wave function,

00:21:44.612 --> 00:21:46.570
the wave function that
we're after in this part

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.670
of the course.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.040
So it's just a
representation, but it's one

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.338
that you don't find in
classical simulations

00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:55.630
that you did in the first part.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.710
But you do find it here.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.230
And it's really important to
know when you're converged.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.340
And say that part again.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.770
When are you converged?

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.100
AUDIENCE: When you use --

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.250
when you take whatever
you're trying to calculate--

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.000
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Ah, stop right there.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.210
That's it-- whatever
you're trying to calculate.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.888
What are you trying
to calculate?

00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:16.680
Give me an example.

00:22:19.482 --> 00:22:20.940
AUDIENCE: Total
energy of a system.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.960
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Total
energy of the system.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.840
Now give me another example.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.200
AUDIENCE: HOMO-LUMO gap.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
HOMO-LUMO gap.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.360
I love it.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.260
We could go on like
this, but I won't.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.310
But now, are the number
of basis functions

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.880
you need to converge the
representation of your wave

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.593
function the same for the total
energy or the HOMO-LUMO gap?

00:22:40.593 --> 00:22:43.140
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.890
AUDIENCE: Depends.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.817
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:44.817 --> 00:22:47.150
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It depends
is always a good answer.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.310
You can always write that.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.300
Don't put it for your name,
but you can put it for--

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.110
well, I don't know.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.595
Maybe you do need the
same number of functions

00:22:55.595 --> 00:22:56.470
for those properties.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.240
But you need to look at them on
a property-by-property basis,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.490
no pun intended.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.150
OK?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.050
So very good.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.200
Now, without solving any
equations, which electron

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.840
do you think would require more
basis functions to describe

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.920
well the 2p electron in carbon
or the 3p electron in silicon?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.010
Who can tell me what they think?

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.510
Yeah?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.190
AUDIENCE: 3p
electron in silicon.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.315
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
you need-- now, hang on.

00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:24.840
You need more basis
functions for 3p?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.850
Tell me why.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.633
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
more electron attraction.

00:23:30.633 --> 00:23:32.050
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Well, what is

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.330
it that makes you need
more basis functions?

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.880
What is it that makes you
need more basis functions?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.380
Yeah?

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.422
AUDIENCE: It's like a more
complex wave function.

00:23:41.422 --> 00:23:44.390
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
OK, so if the function--

00:23:50.838 --> 00:23:58.620
if the wave function looks
like this versus, say,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.990
a wave function that
looks like that,

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.500
which one do you think I'm going
to need more functions for?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.380
I'm going to need more basis
functions for this one.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.120
Does everybody see that?

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.490
Now, and then the question is,
OK, so if you put that down,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.460
you're already
doing really well,

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.370
because on these questions, what
I'm looking for isn't even--

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:33.650
if you didn't know the answer
to what 2p carbon or 3p silicon,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.070
which one is more wiggly,
but you knew that you needed

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.410
to know that to answer the
question, that's already--

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:45.060
that's, in my opinion,
4 out of 5 points,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.050
because that's the key.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.340
The key is what--

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.470
I'm trying to just get
at the key things you

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.110
need to know in computational
quantum mechanics, some

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.370
of the key ingredients.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.410
And that's the key is
that you need more basis

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.040
functions if the
electrons function wiggles

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.150
more or wiggles more quickly.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.950
AUDIENCE: But it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.867
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What was more for carbon?

00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:14.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.662
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Because the--

00:25:16.662 --> 00:25:19.720
you see, it's what
you said, actually.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.290
You have more
screening in silicon.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.250
And so the outer electrons,
they're further out,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.700
and they actually wiggle less.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.352
They're more smooth.

00:25:32.352 --> 00:25:33.310
That's not always true.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.143
But between silicon and
carbon, that's true.

00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:37.240
I think I talked about
that in lecture 2.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.650
And it's part of why carbon
can make such strong bonds.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.310
So carbon has no p
electrons in the core.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.330
Silicon does.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.170
So the screening
is very different.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.250
A p electron in carbon sees
no p electrons in the core.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.900
But a p electron
in silicon does.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.790
It sees two p
electrons in the core.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.950
So that screening,
that shielding,

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.930
makes a huge difference
in the kind of bonding

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.960
that these two atoms can do.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.180
That's why we're made of
carbon and not silicon.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.340
But that's not the question.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.080
Now let's do another one.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.930
Materials are composed
of nuclei and electrons.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.540
When the Kohn-Sham
equation is solved,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.880
solutions only for
electrons are obtained.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.430
Why do we not care about nuclei?

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.230
Come on, that's a
good one, right?

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.460
Sam?

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.710
AUDIENCE: So basically,
nuclei are 1,000 times heavier

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:25.400
than electrons.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.790
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.373
AUDIENCE: But
realistically, electrons

00:26:27.373 --> 00:26:29.840
are basically still
[INAUDIBLE] motions in saying

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.840
that electrons are [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.750
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: And do you
remember what that's called?

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.135
It's that guy's
back, the tattoo.

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:41.260
AUDIENCE: Born-Oppenheimer.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.990
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Born-Oppenheimer.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.130
See, that's going to be it.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.850
You're always going to remember
that guy's tattoo on his back,

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.740
and you're going to
think Born-Oppenheimer.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.975
It's effective.

00:26:51.555 --> 00:26:53.800
OK, and then we'll do one more.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.410
What does k-point
sampling refer to?

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.420
Below are the band
structures computed

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.830
for two different materials.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.350
Which requires more
k-points to converge?

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.800
And what I'm looking for
here is not a long essay.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.130
It's really just a sentence
to explain the reasoning.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.360
So somebody tell me which of
these might need more k-points.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.060
Which band structure
would need more k-points?

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.720
I see this.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.410
Yes, why?

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.585
AUDIENCE: There's
more variation.

00:27:22.585 --> 00:27:25.200
There's more wiggles with
it, so you need more points

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.790
to get after [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.525
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It's the
same-- you see, these are--

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:38.870
this is also just a
convergence question, OK?

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.088
Did everybody see that?

00:27:40.088 --> 00:27:41.630
This is another
convergence question.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.088
I mean, you're not going to
just get convergence questions,

00:27:44.088 --> 00:27:45.650
but those two were.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.460
And then we did this one.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.190
Did everybody see
this last time?

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.100
OK.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.010
This is that band
structure that you got,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.900
but your advisor
spilled coffee on it,

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.410
and this is the
only copy you have.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.350
And so I'm not-- you won't
have a coffee-spilled-- well,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.420
you might have a
coffee-spilled band structure,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.690
because it's kind of a
fun way to ask questions.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.170
But you'll definitely have a
question about band structures.

00:28:18.123 --> 00:28:20.540
So make sure you kind of are
comfortable with the concepts

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.486
that I'm going to--

00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:25.160
we'll review right now
with band structures.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.860
So those are a couple of
nice examples of the kinds

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.315
of problems you might get.

00:28:29.315 --> 00:28:32.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you can see a
coffee stain in the example.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.657
Don't [INAUDIBLE] because
[INAUDIBLE] put in there.

00:28:34.657 --> 00:28:36.740
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah,
we're going to actually

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.580
use real coffee this time.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.350
[LAUGHTER] OK, good.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.860
So what we're going to do now--

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.690
so any questions?

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.770
The questions are great.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.920
It's really helpful-- questions
on the p set, questions

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.220
on those questions?

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.870
Questions on the questions?

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.710
Questions about--

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.627
AUDIENCE: The Celtics.

00:29:02.627 --> 00:29:04.085
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What was that?

00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:04.910
The Celtics?

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.320
They're going to wrap it up.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.240
Yeah, tonight.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:16.670
Anyway, OK-- I just like sharing
a little something like this

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:17.570
each time.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.990
Has everybody seen this one?

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.690
With great power comes
great responsibility.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.520
Vision without
action is a dream.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.695
Action without vision
is a nightmare.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.970
This is my reminder.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.810
When you do calculations,
this is what counts most.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.880
don't just start computing.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.130
Think about what you're doing.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.310
I'm going to take you through
a little bit of a tour of some

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.990
of the key concepts
that I think would

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.400
be important to know about that
you might get questions on.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.960
You might get a question on--

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.570
and I think there's a
practice quiz question or two

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.240
on some of these--

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.430
concepts of what led to quantum
mechanics, which we talked

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.300
about in the first lecture.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.940
So why did we need
a new physics?

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.300
Why did we need something new?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.750
And the fact that you have--

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:27.080
as a result of a lot of research
in that time, what came out

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:32.190
of it was that matter has both
wave and particle character.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.340
So we've talked about
this experiment.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.910
We've talked about
that experiment.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.640
So you would know if
I asked a question

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.750
about those experiments,
maybe, one of them.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:48.850
And we found that
that, actually, light

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.960
can behave like a particle, and
matter can behave like a wave.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.840
And it would have
a wave vector k

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.430
that's related to its
momentum and a frequency.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.600
And that's kind of really cool.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.695
So if I asked you what the
wavelength of a baseball was--

00:31:07.695 --> 00:31:09.820
I think that might have
been on the practice quiz--

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.980
then that's something you
could compute, for example.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.190
I won't ask you
that, but you kind of

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.450
could compute the
wavelength of something.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.680
And then that took us to--

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.220
well, OK, so you have
to represent matter now

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.570
with waves.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:36.040
So we're going to have
this function to do that.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.720
So that took us
to this function.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.580
We said there's going
to be this function.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.870
It's a wave function.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.700
Well, that's a creative name.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.550
It's a function that
represents waves.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.910
OK, that's good.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.270
And we also said--

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.340
we didn't really explain
this much, but we said,

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.810
but you can't--

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.960
we don't actually know much
about the physical meaning

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.190
of this function.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.650
But we do know that,
when you square it,

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.600
or since it's complex,
you multiply it

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.430
by its complex
conjugate, that you

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.140
get the density of this
quantum mechanical particle.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.010
And we said, this is it.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.470
This is what we need.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.840
We need this function,
because in quantum mechanics,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.910
that function tells you
where electrons are,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.607
the probability
density of electrons.

00:32:20.607 --> 00:32:21.940
And so that's the thing we need.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.357
Because if you
know that, then you

00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:25.060
get all these other
properties, see?

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.390
Once you have this, that's
what the DOS comes from.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.200
That's what the band
structure comes from.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.710
It came from solving for that.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.710
And then the question is,
well, what are you solving?

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.490
And so what we needed
there was the F

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.040
equals MA of quantum mechanics.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.340
We needed the equation
that governs the behavior

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.020
of this wave function.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.190
And that's the
Schrodinger equation.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.690
That's it.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.030
This is it, right?

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.697
So do we have the
function that we need,

00:33:00.697 --> 00:33:02.822
which when we solve it, we
get all these properties

00:33:02.822 --> 00:33:04.240
that we really
care about, that we

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.220
can use to make solar
cells and solar fuels

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.860
and lots of other things?

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.480
There is an equation
we need to solve

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.493
to get that wave function,
and that equation

00:33:12.493 --> 00:33:13.660
is the Schrodinger equation.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.450
And we took time out,
because we don't like time.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.440
It just complicates things.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.805
And so we did it for
the stationary solution.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.720
And the Schrodinger equation
is H psi equals E psi,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.860
where H is the total energy.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.140
So it's the kinetic energy
plus the potential energy.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.470
And when you write
these out, you

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.570
write out the kinetic energy
as this second derivative.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.840
And the potential--
well, that depends

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.410
on what we're talking about.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.750
But if we're talking about, say,
an electron in a hydrogen atom,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.690
then it's E squared over r.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.300
That's your potential,
the potential that that

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.650
charged particle feels.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.320
So that's a hydrogen atom.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.170
That's the electron
in a hydrogen atom.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.270
I'm going through this quickly,
because I think we are all

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.260
feeling OK about this.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.409
But if anyone has questions,
please raise your hand, please,

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.290
because if you have a
question, it's very likely

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.969
someone else has
the same question.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:26.250
Any questions?

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.850
Now, you can solve this
equation, actually,

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.290
very easily.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:36.730
We did this, I think, in
the second lecture, maybe.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.659
And you get solutions
for that wave function.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.570
And we talked about how
one of the key results

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.139
here is that you
get quantization

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.880
of the energies of
the wave function.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.400
And what that means is
that the energies can only

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.550
have certain values--

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.615
nothing in between.

00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:57.090
And we talked about
the magic of that

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.780
and how that explains
these spectral lines that

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.420
were observed long before.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.240
It finally explained those.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.810
So I don't know like calculating
the energy differences here

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.220
or how much energy it takes
to allow electrons to move

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.890
from one level to another--

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.840
that sounds like a
good problem to me.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.420
and units, so forth.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.290
Now, the other
piece of ingredient

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.010
that was really important is
that, actually, electrons--

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.790
they have this angular
moment-- they have this spin.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.710
And it was observed
by putting them--

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.600
shooting them through a big
magnet and basically finding

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.770
that--

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:41.520
what was observed?

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.850
What was observed wasn't
just that they had spin

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.340
but that they only had
one of two kinds of spin.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.055
So instead of
getting a spread, you

00:35:49.055 --> 00:35:50.430
would think you
would be applying

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.700
a force on these electrons,
which are magnetic,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.740
since they're spinning.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.700
But they're not.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.090
But that's how we like to think
of them in our classical minds.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.250
You would think
that you would get

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.600
a nice continuous spread of
force acting on them, causing

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.710
them to separate.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.770
But instead, you
only get two spots.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.930
That was really important,
because they told us

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:19.000
that these there's another kind
of quantum mechanical number,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.500
which is the spin number,
which can be up or down--

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.120
only up or down.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.020
And then you put that
together, and you put together

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.480
your solution for the
Schrodinger equation,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.620
and voila.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:39.550
You get, essentially-- oh, you
add on a little bit of Pauli.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.010
You put in some
Pauli exclusions--

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.130
just a little bit.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.620
You don't want to over-Pauli--

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.320
anyway, never mind.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.050
Which it says that, OK, we
got these quantum numbers--

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.260
you know, N, L, M,
and now the spin.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.070
And no two electrons
can have the same set,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.370
which results in the fact that
you cannot put more than two

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.085
electrons in one of
these energy levels.

00:37:03.085 --> 00:37:04.460
And remember,
these energy levels

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.200
are kind of like
the key ingredient

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.237
we're after in this class.

00:37:09.237 --> 00:37:10.820
It's really one of
the key ingredients

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.520
we're after, where do those
electrons want to sit,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.790
because it tells us so much
about properties of materials

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.780
that are interesting.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.750
Now, that really allows
you to go to a description

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.620
of the whole periodic table.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.090
The problem is that that
was a description based

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.590
on one electron and one proton.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.580
We solve for that.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.000
We could solve for that.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.348
And so we did, and
we got the levels,

00:37:37.348 --> 00:37:38.390
and that was really neat.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.190
And then we had rules
about how to fill them,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.240
and that was really neat.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.790
And then you can
actually explain

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.460
a lot of chemistry that way.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.150
You get your S and your
P and your D orbitals,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.062
and you fill them.

00:37:50.062 --> 00:37:51.520
The problem is
that, actually, when

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.920
you have anything
but hydrogen, you

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.120
have more than one electron.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.620
and so that really requires
going back to the Schrodinger

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.460
equation and adding in the
interactions between electrons

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.560
that was not in the
original hydrogen atom.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.300
And that's hard.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.890
That's the hard
part, hard stuff.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:22.370
And so we turn to computation.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.260
That's really hard
to do analytically,

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.950
and it gets much, much worse
the more electrons you have.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.270
any questions up to this point?

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:32.600
All right.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.890
So how do we do that?

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.820
Well, you've got to-- so
we're using computation,

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.620
but you can't just
throw this onto a grid

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.880
or throw this into MATLAB.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.860
It still isn't doable.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.010
And so there's sort
of two branches

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.310
in computational quantum
mechanics, one that loosely

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.130
is labeled quantum chemistry
and the other kind of more

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.770
solid-state physics,
density functional theory.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.682
And both of them
make approximations.

00:38:56.682 --> 00:38:58.390
And we talked about
those approximations.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.140
And what they're approximating
is the Schrodinger equation.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.880
They're simplifying
it, because even as

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.530
simple as that may look--

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.700
just throw that into MATLAB--

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.830
it doesn't happen.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.650
You can't solve it when
you have more than a couple

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.380
of electrons--

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.967
five electrons, I
don't know, six.

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:18.050
That won't be on the quiz.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.980
[LAUGHS]

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.080
But you just can't solve
it exactly on a computer

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.910
unless you have the
age of the universe.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.190
And even then, it's too hard.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.080
So we've got to
simplify this equation.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.590
And mostly in the quantum
chemistry world, what you do

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.330
is you simplify this.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.020
We talked about using
basis sets, basis functions

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.830
to represent this.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.810
Well, you can restrict
the degrees of freedom

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.400
in that function, as well.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.900
And that makes that
equation much easier.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.910
And the other thing you can do
is you can actually change--

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.960
so that's changing this
part, and the other thing

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.120
is you could change this part.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.400
And that's what physicists
mostly did, and now everyone

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.720
holds hands and sings
"Kumbaya," and everyone's happy.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.580
Back then, there was
a lot of two fields,

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.950
physicists versus
chemists, and all that.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.670
But we're all
happy together now.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.800
So chemists do density
functional theory.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.400
Physicists don't mind wave
function-based methods,

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.780
as they're called.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:24.490
The result-- and this
was one of my red flag

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.160
key results here
is that what you've

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.890
done when you do this is you
have taken a problem that

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.945
involved all of these
interactions-- remember,

00:40:33.945 --> 00:40:37.170
1 over r 1, 2 meant
taking into account

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.410
the interaction between
electron 1 and electron 2.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.420
And that just gets
really painful and hard.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.960
And so what you've
done in both categories

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.080
is you've completely changed
the picture into what's

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.290
called a mean field picture.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.430
So each electron is
only now really solved

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.290
in the context of an average
field of the other electrons.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.090
That's the simplification key.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.950
That's the key simplification.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.470
So the mean field
methods are really

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.600
what enable us to do
computational quantum

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.745
mechanics for large systems.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.880
I don't really think
I need to review this

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.580
too much, because I did
just review this, I think,

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.710
a week ago.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.890
But the density is a
nice thing to work with,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.860
because unlike the function with
sort of-- if you wanted a grid

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.540
to represent each--

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.610
a grid of points, even as the
number of atoms in the system

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.075
grows, the density
grid is just the same.

00:41:39.075 --> 00:41:41.450
So the number of points you
need to represent the density

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.075
is constant, while
the number of points

00:41:43.075 --> 00:41:46.230
you would need to represent
psi grows exponentially.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:52.340
So it's a really hard problem
in the context of scaling

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.830
with size for the wave
function, but the density

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.072
offers this really nice scaling.

00:41:59.072 --> 00:42:01.030
And so that's what density
functional theory is

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.610
is it's a method that relates--

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.830
it shows that the density can
be related to the wave function.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.570
And then you just
work with the density,

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.160
and you throw out
the wave function.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.980
You bring it back in
later, but that's basically

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.990
what the theory does.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.190
The problem is that
it pushes out--

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:26.880
it has this sort of term that
you talked about in lecture 3

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:32.420
or 4 that you have to kind
of approximate, this exchange

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.690
correlation potential.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.510
We talked about that.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.530
And the exchange correlation
potential-- let's get to that--

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:43.730
is not known.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.190
If you knew it, it would be,
actually, an exact method.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.240
But it's not, and so
you make approximations.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.240
And these are actually
two of the approximations

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.910
that you have as options
in the NanoLab tools.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:02.270
Now, what these approximations
are is not part of this class.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:09.170
That gets into kind of
more complicated equations

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.520
that we would have to cover
that I don't want to do.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.150
But what I want you
to pull out from this

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:22.690
is that we are not solving the
Schrodinger equation exactly.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.750
We are making approximations.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.580
And those approximations
need to be checked.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:32.050
So you see, there's two
kinds of convergence here.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.760
That's the key, right?

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.780
And this is where I come
with responsibility.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:44.600
One kind of convergence
is k-points, basis sets.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.710
But another kind of
convergence is, where are you

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.110
in accuracy space?

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.500
Where are you?

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.430
Do you know?

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.380
Because you are
making approximations.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.900
When you pull down that
option on the toolkit

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.690
to say GGA or LDA, what
you're doing is you're

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.790
changing the form of this.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.620
Which one is right?

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.470
You're still not solving
the equations exactly.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.262
So how do if you're right?

00:44:13.262 --> 00:44:14.720
Throw that out
there as a question.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.245
AUDIENCE: Find an
experimentalist.

00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:21.120
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Find an experimentalist.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.668
Bother them.

00:44:23.668 --> 00:44:25.020
Say, can you measure this?

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.570
And they say, no, are you crazy?

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.140
My advisor just told me
to work 90 hours a week

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.530
on something else.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.280
So then what do you do, because
it's not in the literature?

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.985
Yeah?

00:44:35.985 --> 00:44:38.027
AUDIENCE: Try a bunch of
different approximations

00:44:38.027 --> 00:44:39.270
and see if any of them agree.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.980
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: See
if any of them agree.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.200
Let's suppose half of them
agree, and half of them

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.100
disagree.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.230
Say I had 10 functionals
to choose from.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:49.610
What else could you do?

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:50.630
Or are you done?

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:52.280
Is that good enough?

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.983
AUDIENCE: Maybe run one more.

00:44:53.983 --> 00:44:55.400
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Run one more.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.480
AUDIENCE: The tiebreaker.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.022
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
The tiebreaker--

00:44:58.022 --> 00:44:58.554
I love it.

00:44:58.554 --> 00:45:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.280
Sadly, there are papers in
the literature that kind of

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.440
take that approach.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.600
It's a little too loosey-goosey.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.920
But it was a good idea.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.760
OK, what else?

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.050
Well, is it good enough?

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:15.185
I mean, if I had
10 functionals--

00:45:15.185 --> 00:45:17.060
by the way, there are
hundreds of functionals

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.060
now to choose from in
density functional theory.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.100
If I had 10, and
half of them agreed,

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.580
but the other half
didn't, what do I do?

00:45:27.484 --> 00:45:29.910
AUDIENCE: Apply
quantum chemistry.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.452
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK, why?

00:45:32.452 --> 00:45:34.400
AUDIENCE: It's a whole
different theory.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.692
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Whole
different theory-- good, OK.

00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:38.651
Go to a different theory
for quantum mechanics.

00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:40.375
See what that agrees with.

00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.910
But see, that may
have its own whole--

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:47.680
it does have its own whole
world of approximations.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.870
But that's the right--

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.960
that's sort of the right way to
think about it, because there

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.940
are theories that are
more accurate and less

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.220
accurate in how they solve for--

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.390
how they simplify the
Schrodinger equation.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.320
So you can try to go to
more accurate, or what

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.070
are known to be better
accurate, theories.

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.750
Now, there's one
other thing to do.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.090
I told you that, in
this particular case,

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.380
it's a solar fuel that
you just calculated.

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:20.100
You think it's going
to be revolutionary

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.200
but only by one functional.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.228
The other functional
says it's really bad.

00:46:25.228 --> 00:46:26.520
You went to an experimentalist.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.690
They said no.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:29.310
And you can't do
higher-level theory.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.089
Anything else you can do?

00:46:34.089 --> 00:46:35.510
AUDIENCE: Take a poll?

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.456
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Take a poll
[LAUGHS] of your group members?

00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:41.160
[LAUGHS] That's good.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.290
I like that-- computational
people, people computing.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:46.320
What else?

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.803
AUDIENCE: Request more funding.

00:46:47.803 --> 00:46:49.220
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What is that?

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.720
AUDIENCE: I said,
request more funding.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.512
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Request more funding--

00:46:52.512 --> 00:46:55.190
you're talking like a professor.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:56.870
What else?

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:57.800
Anything else?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.390
There is something
else you can do.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.170
So the key is--

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.760
I said that the experiment for
that fuel hasn't been done.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.260
But--

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.830
AUDIENCE: Try a different fuel.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.210
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.050
Use the same level
theory on a system

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.960
that has been done
that's related,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.630
that's closely related.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.310
While I modified azobenzenes
and make a good fuel,

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.660
that hasn't been made yet.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.280
But azobenzene has.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.410
Did my theory work well
for all of the data

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.630
I can get my hands on
that's relevant to what I'm

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.760
simulating for that material?

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.940
This is validation.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.990
This is validation.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.060
It's not the same
as convergence.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.280
I said there's sort of
two kinds of convergence.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.930
This kind is called
validation, and it

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.330
is critical in computation.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.730
It is a critical
part of computation.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.130
Please don't go
away from this class

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:53.010
without remembering that part.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.480
Know where you are.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.670
Test your calculations.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.150
Be confident in them
because you validated them.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.830
Too much computation goes
on that doesn't have that,

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:07.780
and it's a lot of wasted time--

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.590
[LAUGHS] computer time,
but also people time.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.240
Now, so we can get
a lot of properties.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.103
We can get properties of--

00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:21.020
I've talked about lots
of different properties

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.860
you can get.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.220
I won't ask you anything on
the test about properties

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.840
we haven't actually really
talked about in class, OK?

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.080
But you can calculate
a lot of things.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.370
We just talked about this.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.863
The one thing-- OK, did you
exit the scf at the right loop?

00:48:37.863 --> 00:48:40.280
Don't worry about that, because
the code just sort of does

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.240
that for you.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.413
Was my basis big enough?

00:48:42.413 --> 00:48:43.580
We talked about that, right?

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.060
Convergence for molecules--
was my box big enough?

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.368
Now, why do I have
a box for molecules?

00:48:50.368 --> 00:48:51.410
What does that even mean?

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:54.944
Yeah?

00:48:54.944 --> 00:48:57.569
AUDIENCE: So you're going to use
plane waves as your basic set,

00:48:57.569 --> 00:48:58.740
and they're periodic.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.828
And a real molecule's
not going to be periodic.

00:49:00.828 --> 00:49:03.280
So you don't want to
have it see itself.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.860
So you need a really big box.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.440
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440
Exactly.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.790
So if I have--

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.668
so a lot of these codes,
especially plane-wave codes,

00:49:13.668 --> 00:49:15.210
were originally
developed for solids.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.210
But they work fine
for molecules.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.130
Actually SIESTA's not
even a plane-wave code.

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.070
It uses a different
kind of basis.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:27.480
It uses a more Gaussian-like,
localized functions basis.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.240
But it's still a periodic box.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.880
It's based on a periodic box.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.340
So that means that when you
input something like an atom,

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:44.330
if I want to simulate
that one atom, then

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:53.360
I need to make sure that I leave
enough space so that it's not

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.210
going to feel its periodic
image in all directions.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.280
So for a new molecule, is my
box big enough means leaving

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.950
vacuum between the molecules.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:10.950
And then we talked about solids.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.458
And that's certainly
fair game for the quiz,

00:50:13.458 --> 00:50:15.000
even though we
haven't had a homework

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.738
problem on the solar
cells, certainly I

00:50:17.738 --> 00:50:18.780
wouldn't talk about that.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.360
I won't talk about
solar cells on the quiz.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.700
Or I should rephrase that.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.023
[LAUGHS] I won't
ask you questions

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.690
that we haven't talked
about in lecture.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.680
But the band structure
of a solar cell-- well,

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.450
band structures we've
talked about a lot, right?

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:48.170
Now, the way we built
up our solids part

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.510
is we said, well,
OK, now we're talking

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.780
not about some molecule
that can have some shape

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.520
and then gets
repeated like this.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.140
But we're actually talking
now about a crystal

00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.730
that goes on forever and ever.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.290
And so it needs to
have a kind of lattice.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:07.790
And we talked about how
you can define that,

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.480
just like we
defined it in class,

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.460
and you've seen it
in other classes.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.040
You define it in a computer.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.230
And then we talked about
the inverse lattice,

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.220
and I'm not going to
go through this again.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.680
But we built this up.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.480
Why did we build up
the inverse lattice,

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.620
the understanding of that?

00:51:28.345 --> 00:51:30.163
Where does that come in?

00:51:30.163 --> 00:51:32.080
Why do you need to know
about inverse lattice?

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.272
Yeah?

00:51:33.272 --> 00:51:34.855
AUDIENCE: Because
that's how we define

00:51:34.855 --> 00:51:36.740
the Brillouin zone,
which is where

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.597
we define the k-space vectors.

00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:39.680
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Good.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.752
OK, and why does k-space matter?

00:51:42.752 --> 00:51:45.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
associated with [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.830
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, so that's exactly--

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.920
the inverse lattice is
the reciprocal lattice

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.130
of our real lattice.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.140
It's really important
in crystallography,

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.050
so I think a lot of
you have seen this.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.697
And you can define by just
drawing these perpendiculars

00:52:02.697 --> 00:52:05.030
to the nearest neighbors you
defined the first Brillouin

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:12.240
zone, which is where the energy
levels, those precious energy

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.410
levels of this
molecule that I want--

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:21.090
that first Brillouin zone is
where in the inverse lattice--

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:33.900
see, this now becomes inverse
space, also known as k-space.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.230
That becomes a
degree of freedom.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.480
And so that makes
these guys move.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.600
They can even move
and cross one another.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.950
And that is the
difference between

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.530
a solid computational quantum
mechanics on a solid--

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.830
what you can get
out in a molecule.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.320
And the Brillouin
zone is the playground

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.530
of this space that matters.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.500
Because as we showed
from Bloch's theorem,

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.620
if you go outside of
the Brillouin zone,

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.410
you can just wrap it and get
back exactly to where you work.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.860
So your function and your
energies won't change.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.010
So all that matters is to know
and understand and compute,

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.770
which is what the code does, the
variation inside this Brillouin

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:19.270
zone.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.250
That's why we defined
it, because we just

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:23.140
don't need any other zone.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:30.130
And we got here by looking
at periodic potential,

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:34.940
and the result of solving
the Schrodinger equation

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.310
in the presence of
a periodic potential

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.280
is that you get this new
constraint on the wave

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.900
function.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.150
And the key here is that--

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:51.440
OK, so this is just saying you
can go one lattice vector away

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.873
and get back to same thing.

00:53:52.873 --> 00:53:55.040
That's why I just said about
only the Brillouin zone

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.270
mattering.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.800
But the key result of
Bloch's theorem is not here.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.210
Ha.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.370
But the key results
of Bloch's theorem

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.370
is that you have this
k in the first place.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:11.240
The key result is that
you have a new index.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.600
Just like the quantum numbers
came out of the hydrogen atom,

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.520
you have a new
index that can vary.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.420
And as it varies, it
changes your levels.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.170
And we spent some time
talking about this.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:25.560
So please let me know if you
have any questions about this.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.312
I just talked
right into the mic.

00:54:27.312 --> 00:54:29.860
[LAUGHS] (LOUDER) Let me know
if you have any-- oh, sorry.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:35.930
[LAUGHS] Does everybody
understand that?

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:40.520
By putting-- by mapping
quantum mechanics and all

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.270
of our machinery,
Schrodinger equation,

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.950
approximations to it--

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.430
but remember, H
psi equals E psi.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.380
H has v.

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:55.220
And by having v be the
same everywhere in space,

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:58.340
we got this new
degree of freedom,

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.360
this new thing that's critical.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.950
And this new thing is what
makes a band structure.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:12.690
So if I showed you a
band structure like this,

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.714
what am I simulating?

00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:20.983
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:20.983 --> 00:55:22.400
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What is that?

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400
Forget these other ones.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.506
Just look at those.

00:55:25.506 --> 00:55:28.880
AUDIENCE: It's a molecule.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.690
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah, it's
a non-periodic system, right?

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:41.012
If the bands are flat, you don't
have this variation in k-space.

00:55:41.012 --> 00:55:42.970
And if you don't have
the variation in k-space,

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.510
well, at least to within
what the system can feel,

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:47.620
it's not a crystal.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.100
It's not a periodically
repeating potential.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.730
It may be, or it
may be really close.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:59.110
What if you had a molecular
crystal, which exist?

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:00.910
There are many
molecular crystals.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:02.890
But they're really
far spaced apart.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.140
These molecules are
weakly interacting.

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.192
Well, you might get,
then, something-- you

00:56:08.192 --> 00:56:10.150
might just start to see
this-- and we've played

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.500
with this in the computer.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:15.490
You might just start to
see some little wiggles,

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:19.840
feeling that effective
the variation in k-space.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.980
But you won't see very much.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.160
And then as the interactions,
or as the potential

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.810
that's periodic, gets stronger,
well, then this variation

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.590
can get very high.

00:56:38.257 --> 00:56:39.590
Any questions about any of that?

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:45.430
So that's kind of
the key point there.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.620
And we talked about the
kinds of things you can get.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.220
And we also talked about how--

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.780
so this is density
functional theory.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.560
We talked about how, when you
solve for the band structure,

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.680
you first converge the density.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.555
That's a separate calculation.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.760
And then what am I doing here?

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.440
How do I get this?

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.970
The third point
is sort of silly.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:11.450
You plot.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.370
But point 2, what am I doing?

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:14.690
Somebody explain point 2.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.740
Yeah?

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:22.820
AUDIENCE: You go in
the Brillouin zone,

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.820
and you look at the
different points in k-space.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.450
And then, using
those points, you

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:29.257
define potential for band gaps.

00:57:29.257 --> 00:57:30.340
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.980
Well, you find-- yeah,
you find the band gaps.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.450
You find the energy
levels at each point.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:42.380
But as we said,
as you just said,

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:46.040
you're doing this for lines
in the Brillouin zone.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.530
How do you choose which lines?

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.627
AUDIENCE: Your choice.

00:57:49.627 --> 00:57:50.960
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: My choice--

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.920
but I need to choose.

00:57:54.728 --> 00:57:55.590
Sam?

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:57.600
AUDIENCE: You pick the
high-symmetry region.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.270
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah, it's
the high-symmetry parts, right?

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.550
We talked about that.

00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:03.300
Because why?

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.450
AUDIENCE: Nature
likes symmetries.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.560
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
that's a good answer.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.102
[LAUGHS] That's
always a good answer.

00:58:10.102 --> 00:58:11.350
Nature does like symmetry.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.330
It's a beautiful thing.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.490
But is that really
why that's what

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.440
I do for my band structure?

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.446
What does that mean?

00:58:20.446 --> 00:58:23.115
AUDIENCE: After reaction
occurs, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:23.115 --> 00:58:24.490
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Pretty much.

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:28.900
That's where the variation
that could happen in the energy

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.360
levels is going to happen.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.790
And that's what you
want to capture, right?

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:38.530
So a band structure is a
simple two-dimensional way

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:44.110
of cruising through this kind
of complex three-dimensional

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:47.530
Brillouin zone where things
are varying any point I go.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.020
But if I go just along
the high-symmetry points,

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:55.530
then I get the variation
that's usually most important.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.490
And then we talked about
how you fill these up

00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.323
to the Fermi energy.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.538
Is the for energy always at 0?

00:59:04.538 --> 00:59:06.026
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:06.026 --> 00:59:07.020
AUDIENCE: No.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.530
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:13.330
So if I didn't tell you where
the Fermi energy is, and I

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.900
asked you to tell me if it's
a metal or an insulator,

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.760
could you?

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.115
Would it even be possible?

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:26.460
Why or why not?

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.370
Yeah?

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:31.670
AUDIENCE: Because then
we'd see whether or not

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.172
the bands are constant, right?

00:59:33.172 --> 00:59:35.880
And if they're constant, then we
know it's going to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.255
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, and so

00:59:37.255 --> 00:59:38.790
if I leave that
piece of information

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:43.210
out, which I did last
year, and I give you

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:49.910
a band structure
that looks like this,

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:52.310
and then let's say you
have bands up here,

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.530
well, everybody
is really excited

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.780
to call this an insulator.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.070
I'm excited to do it.

00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:01.020
I can hardly hold back.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.330
This is an insulator.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:03.350
But hang on.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.870
If I didn't tell you where
the Fermi energy is, what

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.092
if the Fermi energy is here?

01:00:08.092 --> 01:00:09.550
You got to have
all the information

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:12.160
to answer the questions, right?

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.080
So know what
information you need

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.470
if you're asked a question
about a metal insulator.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.450
And you know-- yeah?

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:22.652
AUDIENCE: Why do we typically
begin with the energy at 0?

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.640
What would be a case
where we vary it?

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.164
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It's
only because it's sort of a--

01:00:29.164 --> 01:00:34.344
there's no good reason
except that it's convenient.

01:00:34.344 --> 01:00:36.579
AUDIENCE: OK, so usually
it's just static?

01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:39.079
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It's just
nice to shift them so they're

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:40.780
always at the same place.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.840
And then we can compare
things more easily.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.680
Why is this definitely going
to be a metal if I have

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.970
an odd number of electrons?

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.803
OK, there's a little
discussion there.

01:01:04.803 --> 01:01:06.470
I want to know what
you guys are saying.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:07.345
AUDIENCE: Confirming.

01:01:07.345 --> 01:01:09.470
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Confirming, OK.

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:13.320
You're validating-- I love
it-- using the group consensus.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.452
Crowdsourcing is very powerful.

01:01:15.452 --> 01:01:16.910
Anyway, don't use
it for computing.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:20.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if there's
not enough electrons, then

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:21.310
a band's only half filled.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.378
The Fermi energy has
to be in that band.

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:24.420
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why?

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.310
That's exactly right.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:25.810
Why?

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:28.430
AUDIENCE: The Fermi energy is
where you fill up until it's--

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.900
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That's it.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.130
Did everybody get that?

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:34.790
Fermi energy is the energy
that you fill the electrons to.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.840
So if you have an odd
number of electrons, well,

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.286
how many electrons go in
each one of these bands?

01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:41.869
AUDIENCE: Two.

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:42.911
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Two.

01:01:42.911 --> 01:01:45.220
So if I have an odd number
of electrons, one of them

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.810
is only going to be half filled.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:50.380
That means my Fermi
energy has to cut it.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.840
It's got to cut it
somewhere, which

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.600
means I have a band crossing
the Fermi energy, which

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.740
means it's a metal--

01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.330
has to be.

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:04.840
You can think about
the same for an atom,

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.880
except that atoms are metals.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.690
But most atoms have that case.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.590
They have half or
partially filled levels.

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:15.610
You don't fill all the
p electrons in carbon

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:18.130
but we don't think of the
carbon atom as a metal,

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.425
because atoms and
molecules don't really

01:02:20.425 --> 01:02:21.550
have this kind of behavior.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.910
But it's the same idea.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.250
You're partially filling levels.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:35.600
We talked about-- how
are we feeling about

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.720
direct versus indirect gaps?

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.500
Good?

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.820
OK, we talked about that.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.270
Yeah, liking that-- that
could be a good question.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:49.280
And we talked about other
things that you can calculate--

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.440
vibrational properties.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.830
We did talk about
magnetization, right?

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:56.090
Now, this is not--

01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:01.850
sorry, this is actually from a
different code we used to use.

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:03.230
So just ignore this.

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:06.440
We used to use a different
code than SIESTA.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.260
And that was the input for it.

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:14.900
And this is showing that
you can do calculations

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:20.960
of, say, different phases of
a magnetic material like iron.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.290
And how would I calculate
the magnetization

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.810
of those materials?

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:33.080
This was in lecture something,
some number of days ago.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:33.730
Yeah?

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.476
AUDIENCE: I guess you could put
on and apply the magnetic field

01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:38.350
and then see where
[INAUDIBLE] is.

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.100
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
You absolutely could,

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.960
and that would be really hard.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.670
But you could do that, actually.

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.660
And we do do that.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:49.470
But that's a hard calculation.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.950
What is the magnetization of
material what's it due to,

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:54.630
anyway?

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.320
What part of the
materials is due to?

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.162
Yeah?

01:03:57.162 --> 01:03:58.954
AUDIENCE: A difference
in density and space

01:03:58.954 --> 01:04:00.470
between the spin
up and spin down.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:01.553
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:04:01.553 --> 01:04:03.560
Yeah, it's due to electrons.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.000
It's due to the spin
of the electrons.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.700
That's what gave us the
Stern-Gerlach experiments.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.740
It was the
magnetization possible

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.860
of the spins of the electrons.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.690
It was the fact that
a magnetic field

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.820
could exert a force on those.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:29.160
Now, we said that,
in your material,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.790
you have spin up
electrons and spin down

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:35.760
electrons, the precious
things that were computing

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.000
this whole second half.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.100
And you fill those up.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.330
And you fill them up.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.190
According to the Pauli
exclusion principle,

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.700
you fill the levels up with
these electrons, right?

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.350
But when you get to a
solid or, even in atoms,

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.210
you don't always
necessarily have

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:58.720
the same up and down electrons.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.630
You can have differences.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.180
And when you have
differences between them,

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.340
you can have a net
magnetic moment.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.950
And we talked about that before.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:16.533
And then we said, well,
OK, if I had an atom,

01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:18.200
then you can have a
net magnetic moment.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.720
Just count the number of up
electrons minus the number

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.930
of down electrons.

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:27.740
But in a solid, in
a crystal, you now

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.290
have these electrons
in these bands.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:31.740
You need to use something else.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.280
And that's where you need to
use the density of states.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:41.740
And so if you have sort
of the density of states--

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.590
now, remember--
versus, say, energy,

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.090
and this is something
you're all now

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.140
familiar with from the homework,
but we talked about this, also,

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.490
how it relates to magnetism,
and that, in the SIESTA tool,

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:58.250
you could plot, for example,
the spin up electrons.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:02.660
So let's say these are
the spin up electrons.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.032
And then you can plot
the spin down electrons.

01:06:06.032 --> 01:06:07.990
And that's a little hard
to see because there's

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.360
three curves with one color.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.900
But the main point is that the
up electrons and down electrons

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.480
could be very
different in where they

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.390
are in energy, which translates
into what where the peaks are

01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.990
in the DOS.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:31.640
Now, you see, what
matters, though,

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.942
is not the difference
across the whole DOS curve.

01:06:34.942 --> 01:06:35.900
What's going to matter?

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:42.080
It's not the whole
DOS that matters.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.710
It's only part of it.

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:45.860
Which part?

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:53.390
Yeah, it's the part up
until the Fermi level.

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.905
What are the differences in
where I filled electrons?

01:06:56.905 --> 01:06:58.280
Between the ones
that would be up

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.150
and the ones that
would be down, right?

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.960
Now, and that got us to talking
about this spin-polarized thing

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.920
that we talked about last time.

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:13.880
And that's a little button
on your simulation tool

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.470
that you can check or uncheck.

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:20.430
So if something
is spin-polarized,

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:24.270
it allows the up and down
electrons to be different,

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:26.310
to have different energies.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:30.660
So I just I just told
you that difference is

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.950
what gives you magnetization.

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:37.110
So if you don't allow
it to be spin-polarized,

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.250
then you won't get
magnetization, right?

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:39.750
Yeah?

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.482
AUDIENCE: Isn't there
a spin up and spin

01:07:41.482 --> 01:07:47.410
down electron in every energy
state [INAUDIBLE] that are all

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.660
going to have the same energy?

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.535
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Ah, very good question--

01:07:50.535 --> 01:08:00.463
and that is exactly what
spin-polarized does.

01:08:00.463 --> 01:08:02.380
You see, so this is what
you're talking about.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:08.890
You're saying, well, isn't
this just in one level?

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:11.470
But it actually, it
turns out, that that's

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:16.300
what's called a restricted--

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.100
you can say restricted
closed shell

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.750
or restricted open shell--

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:24.100
formalism that is valid
for many, many materials

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.470
and molecules, where in
fact, there's no difference.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:31.000
But in reality-- in reality--

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.950
even when it's
restricted, you still

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:38.290
should write these as a sort of
one spin channel and another.

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:41.590
You could call it alpha is spin
up, and beta is is spin down.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.930
And each one of
those has its own set

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:46.899
of orbitals and wave functions.

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:50.620
So in reality, that's
what you solve for.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.840
Now, in many materials,
it turns out alpha

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.890
and beta electrons do have
the exact same energy level,

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:57.729
but not always.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:09:02.800
And actually, in exactly
what you were talking about,

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.630
when I apply a
magnetic field even

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:07.120
to a material that's
not very magnetic,

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.050
you can cause big
shifts in these.

01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:13.760
You can-- depends.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.970
That depends on the material.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:17.770
But when you apply external
perturbations to the system,

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:20.950
you can split these
so that actually you

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:27.359
do have this picture where the
energy of the spin up channel

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:32.700
for that energy level is
different than the spin

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.250
down channel.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.700
And that's exactly what
spin-polarized does.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.310
It allows those energies
to be different.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:45.390
Without that, you can't really
study magnetism correctly.

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:49.490
That's a good question.

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:52.630
OK, and so we talked
about some other things.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:57.820
We did talk about how you
could calculate electrical

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.910
conductivity-- so
that's fair game--

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:02.500
from the band structure.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.390
There's an equation in the
lecture from last week on that.

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:09.250
We didn't talk about
thermal conductivity.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:13.822
We've talked about optical
properties and magnetization.

01:10:13.822 --> 01:10:15.280
That looks like
it's just repeating

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.250
the first and fourth bullet,
which is interesting to me.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.960
But these are the
kinds of things

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.470
we can calculate using the band
structure in the DOS, which

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:30.552
is what we've focused on
a lot in the last three,

01:10:30.552 --> 01:10:31.135
four lectures.

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.460
So that's certainly I would
think you should know about,

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.660
how to get some of
the key properties

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:45.303
from the band structure in
DOS in these first four,

01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:47.220
excluding thermal, which
we didn't talk about.

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:02.140
And with the
convergence questions,

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.450
we got to have a
convergence question, right?

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:06.280
You just-- you got to.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.360
You would feel cheated if
you didn't have one, right?

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.690
And I don't want you
to have that feeling.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:16.910
When you have a
solid, k-points now

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.880
becomes a convergence parameter.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.910
So that's kind of our review.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.660
Any questions?

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.040
Any questions about that at all?

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.727
Any thoughts or comments?

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:37.560
Any other questions?

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.190
We're good?

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.660
Any questions about the quiz?

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.775
OK, let me just take five
minutes to do a little stuff,

01:11:48.775 --> 01:11:50.650
get it out of the way,
so that after the quiz

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:52.790
we can dive into--

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.180
or do you guys just
kind of want to--

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.130
maybe we stop here, huh?

01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:58.850
Should we stop here?

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:05.220
Except five minutes on
solar right before quiz.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.117
Yeah.

01:12:06.117 --> 01:12:06.950
I'll tell you what--

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:11.360
I'll do my little energy slides,
and then we'll start solar.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.750
Because this isn't really
solar, but it's related.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.780
And I don't think I
showed these before.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.780
Did I show these
before when I was

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.880
motivating research and energy?

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.470
I really like this.

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:25.400
We talk a lot about
global warming.

01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:33.900
And I think that's a
really important topic.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:39.510
And there's some really great
work and, unfortunately,

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:44.442
not enough understanding,
I think, on--

01:12:44.442 --> 01:12:46.935
[LAUGHS] I don't even
know where to begin.

01:12:46.935 --> 01:12:49.530
You know the polls show
that half of this country

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:55.290
still doesn't think that
there's any evidence that it's

01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:56.550
anthropogenically linked.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:13:01.680
But anyway-- OK, so let's
say we don't talk about that.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:07.140
And we ignore these sort of
really hard scientific facts.

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.290
There are other reasons
other reasons to think

01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:11.730
about renewable energy.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.232
And I like this one.

01:13:16.232 --> 01:13:18.690
I don't know how many of you
have seen something like this,

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.310
but this is-- the United
Nations puts this out.

01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:23.590
This is the Human
Development Index.

01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:27.060
What's that Mean I
feel pretty developed.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.540
I mean, does that just
mean I can go to Starbucks

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.580
and get a latte when I want?

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.840
No, this means health
care, education.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.210
It means I can read.

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.940
It means I could maybe have
a light on at night to read.

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.170
But it's primarily some
sort of key indices

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.590
that talk about sort of
the well-being of a person.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:54.390
And that, you can see, is
incredibly strongly correlated

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:57.750
with how much energy
a country gets.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.780
So this is the amount of
per-capita electricity use.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.090
And that's this Human
Development-- it's basically

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:05.140
a well-being index.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:08.520
As you can see, some people get
surprised that Canada beats us.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.570
So how do they beat us?

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.670
AUDIENCE: It's cold.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.140
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It's cold.

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.520
It's really cold
up there, right?

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.550
But you can just see
the strong correlation.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.230
The question is, when they--

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:29.230
see, there's enough
fossil fuels for everybody

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:35.450
here, probably, certainly
if you go with coal.

01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:37.522
There's a whole lot of
energy in fossil fuels,

01:14:37.522 --> 01:14:39.730
and we could lift a lot of
these people up the curve.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.970
The question is, is that
really how we want to do it?

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.760
Now, the other point
I want to make--

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.022
and this will be the
other intro point.

01:14:49.022 --> 01:14:50.480
Just so you have
in your minds when

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.100
you're talking to
people about energy,

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.220
it's not just about
global warming.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:00.540
And this was a great experiment
that was run accidentally

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.300
when 256 power
plants went offline

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.950
in the Eastern corridor.

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:07.770
This is one of these stories
where one plant goes off

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:10.110
because a mouse chewed
through a wire or something,

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:13.740
and then the whole
country feels it.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.570
But it was a great
test bed, because they

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:17.640
were offline for quite a lot.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.260
All these things shut down.

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.070
Everything had to shut down.

01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:23.760
And so people took
planes up and did testing

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.620
and published these
results of the air quality.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.230
And it's incredible
to look at the data.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.690
You look at all
kinds of stuff that

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:35.750
affect what we breathe,
what we see, how we live,

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.610
who has asthma.

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:40.790
A lot of that stuff
goes down instantly.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:44.120
So there are different reasons
than just global warming.

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:48.050
And I like this map.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.592
I don't know if I
showed this to you.

01:15:49.592 --> 01:15:54.270
But this is how much we
consume scaled by consumption.

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.950
This is the country,
the world map.

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:58.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:02.650
We're pretty big-- pretty big.

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:05.330
There are some places
that are pretty small.

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:07.790
OK, so you scale it by country.

01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:14.540
I mean, one question
that comes up and gets

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:22.220
modified is, how much energy
do we really need, or power?

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.390
In 2002, we burned energy at
a rate of 3 and 1/2 terawatts.

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:28.010
What's it going to be in 2050?

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:29.810
Well, if you make
some assumptions

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:35.120
about how many people there are,
and if everybody used energy

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.330
like us, which is
really inefficiently,

01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:42.450
then we need 100
terawatts in 2050.

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:44.890
We only have 13 now, 14 now.

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:46.170
We need a whole lot.

01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:49.480
And we like to think that people
are going to be more efficient,

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.210
and so that becomes the target--

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:54.110
30 terawatts, 30 to 50 terawatts
is what we're going to need.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.110
How do we generate that?

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.890
Well, this is-- and
this is all just, again,

01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:01.770
building up to solar, which
we'll start next week.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:06.220
This is how we've
generated it so far.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.790
We burned a lot of wood,
and that was kind of dirty.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.400
So we burned coal, and
that was really dirty.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.430
But there's so much
coal, and it's so cheap.

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.430
And then we found oil, which
is this magnificent energy

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.930
carrier.

01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:22.000
It's a solar resource.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.680
All these are solar resources,
by the way, including hydro.

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:37.990
Now, natural gas,
with fracking-- this

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:40.900
is going to go-- from this
it's going to go like this

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.920
and just sort of
take over this chart.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.530
Fracking in the last few
years has done more for energy

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:51.110
than anything has
in many decades.

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:53.460
But that's not that's not
what I'm talking about.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.360
I'm talking about
this green sliver,

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.540
which is where I like to sit.

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.130
And we separate out hydro,
because at least on-shore hydro

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:07.427
is fairly tapped out.

01:18:07.427 --> 01:18:09.010
And then you've got
that green sliver.

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:14.035
And the thing is that, if
you look at global warming

01:18:14.035 --> 01:18:16.000
curves, CO2
emissions, people talk

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.790
about wanting half
of all the energy

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.340
to come from that
green sliver by 2050.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.630
So you back the numbers out.

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:25.117
We need 30 terawatts in 2050.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.700
That's how much the world needs
if we're really good at how we

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.940
use it, 100 if we're like us.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.000
And you want half of that to
come from a green sliver, which

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.560
isn't really expanding much.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.570
And notice, it's sitting
on a slope like this.

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.270
This slope is still--

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:43.707
could go even much
higher much faster.

01:18:43.707 --> 01:18:45.040
This is a really tall challenge.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.350
This is the challenge that
I like to think about,

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.730
is how can we actually do that.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.700
And solar PV, I think, is--

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.150
and I'll end on this
side, and so we'll

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:02.320
start we'll pick up from
here on the technology part

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.170
and the science part next week.

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:09.492
We use about 15 terawatts today.

01:19:09.492 --> 01:19:11.450
Does anybody know how
much we get from the sun?

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:13.060
I think I did talk about that.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:16.300
What's the number
we get from the sun?

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.092
We use 15 terawatts a year.

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:20.800
How much do we get
from the sun per year?

01:19:23.686 --> 01:19:25.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:28.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
40,000-- roughly 40,000.

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:33.050
There's just is a whole lot of
energy that comes with the sun.

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:34.940
The energy released
by an earthquake

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.580
we get from the sun in a second.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.870
You probably heard this.

01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:41.000
Every year, we get
that amount of energy

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.860
in an hour from the sun.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.972
Here's what I like--

01:19:43.972 --> 01:19:44.930
you may not have heard.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.990
The total resource
of oil, including

01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:50.810
the 2 trillion
barrels we've used,

01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:54.980
roughly, and the trillion
more that we're going to use,

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.930
for sure--

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:59.330
that amount of
energy resource you

01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:02.186
get from the sun in two days.

01:20:02.186 --> 01:20:05.660
It's an incredible
resource, right?

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.720
But apart from just
painting a barrel black

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.930
and heating water with it,
we really don't use it much.

01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:14.480
And even there, we don't
use it much at all.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:20.900
Solar photovoltaics is an
extremely appealing way

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.700
of trying to capture
this resource

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.150
and really change
that green sliver.

01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:29.150
And so that's what I
want to talk about next,

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:30.290
after the quiz.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:35.400
OK, so see you all Thursday,
office hours tomorrow.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.530
Any questions at all,
please send me an email.

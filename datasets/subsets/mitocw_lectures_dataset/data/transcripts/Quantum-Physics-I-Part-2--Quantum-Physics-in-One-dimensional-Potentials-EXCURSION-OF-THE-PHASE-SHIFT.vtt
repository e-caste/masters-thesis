WEBVTT

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.320
That's a solution.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.790
It's an accomplishment
to have such a solution.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.560
If somebody gives you
a value of the energy,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.340
you can calculate what
is the phase shift,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.860
but we probably want
to do more with it.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:24.780
So you decide to plot
this on a computer.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.850
Again, there's lots of
variables going on here,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.790
so you would want to figure out
what are the right variables

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.750
to plot this.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
And the right variables
suggest themselves.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.030
From k squared equal 2 me over
h squared, unit less constant

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.510
are things like ka, k
prime a, and that's it.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.310
Well, so ka is a proxy
for the energies.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:06.995
OK, a squared is really 2me,
a squared over h bar squared.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.250
And so this we
could call anything.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.220
Well, let's call it u.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.280
On the other hand, k
prime squared then--

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.680
if you have k prime a squared
that it's also unit free

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.880
would be 2me a squared
over h squared plus 2mv0

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.980
a squared over h squared.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.990
You probably recognize them.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.850
The first one is just u squared.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.840
I should call this
u squared, sorry.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.755
U squared, and this is
our friend z0 squared.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.840
It's that number that tells you
the main thing you always want

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.780
to know about a square well.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.750
That ratio between the energy
v0 to the demand to the energy

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.630
that you can build
with h bar m and a.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.970
So here we go.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.110
We have k prime a
given by this quantity,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.010
and therefore let me
manipulate this equation.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.910
Might as well do it.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.410
It probably easier to
consider just tan delta, which

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.720
is the inverse of this.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.570
You would have 1
minus the inverse

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.710
of this would be k prime a
over ka, put the a's always,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:03:05.630
so cot k prime a tan ka over
tan ka plus k prime aka cot k

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.500
prime a.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.065
So in terms of
our variables, see

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:17.160
k prime a is the
square root of this,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.140
so k prime a square root of
u squared plus z0 squared,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.580
and k prime a over ka,
you divide now by u.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.070
So it's square root of 1 plus
z0 squared over u squared.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.320
That's this quantity.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.426
So how big, how much space
do I need to write it?

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.800
Probably, I should
write it here.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.390
1 minus square root of
1 plus z0 squared over u

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:02.010
squared cot k prime a is the
square root of z0 squared

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:17.649
plus u squared and tan of
k a, which is u over tan u

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.440
plus square root
of 1 plus z0 over u

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:33.740
squared cotangent of square root
of z0 squared plus u squared.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.190
OK, it's not terrible.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.560
That's tan delta.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.930
So if somebody gives
you a potential,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.440
you calculate what z0
is for this potential,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.190
you put z0 there, and you
plot as a function of u

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.630
with Mathematica.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.450
And plotting as a
function of u is

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.540
plotting as a function of ka.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.630
And that's perfectly
nice thing to do.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.810
And it can be done
with this expression.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.500
In this expression,
you can also see

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.860
what goes on when u goes to 0.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.090
Not immediately, it takes
a little bit of thinking,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.110
but look at it.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.360
As u goes to 0,
well, these numbers

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.920
are 1, that's perfectly OK.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.340
That seems to diverge, goes
like 1 over u, but u going to 0.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.360
This goes to 0.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.280
So the product goes to a number.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.410
So the whole-- the
numerator goes to a number,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.760
some finite number.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.810
On the other hand,
when u goes to 0,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.120
the denominator
will go to infinity,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.770
because while this term
goes to 0 the tan u,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.990
this number is finite.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.480
And here you have a 1/u.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.420
So the denominator
goes to infinity.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.400
And the numerator
remains finite.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.960
So as u goes to 0, tangent
of delta goes to zero.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.810
So you can choose delta
to be 0 for 0 energy.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:34.580
So as u goes to 0, you get
finite divided by infinity,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.870
and goes to zero.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.010
So tan delta goes to 0.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:49.680
And we can take delta of ka
equals 0, which is u to be 0.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.040
The phase shift
is 0 for 0 energy.

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.160
Let me go here.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.200
So here is an example.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.400
z0 squared equal 3.4.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:19.630
That actually correspond
to 0.59pi for z0.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.910
z0 equal 0.59pi.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.420
You may wonder why
we do that, but let

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.160
me tell you in a second.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.950
So here are a couple
of plots that occur.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.610
So here is u equals ka.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.760
And here's the phase
shift, delta of u.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.260
You have the tangent of
delta, but the phase shift

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.550
can be calculated.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.970
And what you find
is that, yes, it

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.220
starts at 0, as we mentioned.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.490
And then it starts
going down, but it

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:05.545
stabilizes at minus pi,
which is a neat number.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.670
That's what the
phase shift does.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.130
The so-called scattering
amplitude, well you

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.550
could say, when is this
scattering strongest?

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.750
When you get an extra wave of
this propagating more strongly?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:32.840
So you must plot sine squared
delta and sine squared is

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.840
highest for minus pi over 2.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:43.190
So this goes like this, up,
and decays as a function of u.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.190
Third thing, the delay, is 1/a.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:11.240
The delay is 1/a d delta
dk, as a function of u.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.350
So that, you can imagine,
that takes a bit of time,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.740
because you would have to
find the derivative of delta

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.590
with respect to u, and do
all kinds of operations.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.400
Don't worry, you will have
a bit of exercises on this

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.500
to do it yourselves.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.240
But here the delay turns
out to be negative.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.920
And this is unit-free.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.210
And here, comes to be
equal minus 4 for equals 0,

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.490
and goes down to 0.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.390
So in this case, the
delay is negative.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.780
So the reflected
packet comes earlier

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.200
than you would expected,
which is possible,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.420
because the reflected
packet is going slowly here.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.270
Finally, at this point, reaches
more kinetic energy, just--

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.360
and then back.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.420
So that's the delay.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.420
And you can plot another thing.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.090
Actually it's kind of
interesting, is the quantity

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.980
a, this coefficient here.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.370
That gives you an idea
of how big the wave

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.910
function is in the well.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.870
How much does it
stick near the well?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.340
So it peaks to 1.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.460
And it actually goes
like this, and that's

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.790
the behavior of this form.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.810
Basically, it does those things.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:56.510
So, so far so good.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.070
We got some information.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.310
And then you do a
little experiment,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.816
and try, for
example, z0 equals 5.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.520
And you have delta
as a function of u,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.050
and here is minus pi, minus 2pi.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.770
And actually, you find that it
just goes down, and approaches

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.970
now minus 2pi.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:42.200
So actually, if you
increase this z0 a bit,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.410
it still goes to pi, a pi
excursion of the phase.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.860
But suddenly, at
some value, it jumps.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.670
And it now goes to 2pi.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.450
And if you do with a
larger value, at some point

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.610
it goes to 3pi and 4pi.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.210
And it goes on like that.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:15.320
Well if z0 would have been
smaller, like half of this,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.010
the phase would go down
and would go back up,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.020
wouldn't go to minus pi.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.120
It does funny things.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.020
So what's really
happening is that there

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.900
is a relation between
how much the phase moves,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.160
and how many bound states
this potential has.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.490
And you say, why in the world?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.780
This calculation had nothing
to do with bound states.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.050
Why would the phase shift
know about the bound states?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.300
Well actually, it does.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.000
And here is the thing.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.290
If you remember, you've
actually solved this problem

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.945
in homework, the half
square well, in which you

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:07.560
put an infinite wall here.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.390
And if you had the full square
well, from minus a to a,

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.590
this problem has all
the old solutions

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.280
of the full square well.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.950
All the old solutions exist.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:28.140
And if you remember
the plots that you

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.620
would do in order
to find solutions,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:40.050
you have pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, 2pi.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.100
And here is the even solution.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.110
Here is the odd solution.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.740
I'll do it like that.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.620
Here is an even solution.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.512
Here is an odd solution.

00:13:55.512 --> 00:13:59.540
And I marked the odd
solutions, because we

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.720
care about the odd ones, because
that's what this potential has.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:12.670
So z0 equals 0.59pi is
a little more than pi/2.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.050
So it corresponds
to one solution.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:21.360
So there is one bound
state for this z0.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.430
z0 equals 5 is about here.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.840
it's in between 3pi/2 and this.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.450
And there's two nodes,
two intersections.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.450
Therefore, two solutions
in the square well.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:42.330
And here we have that the phase
has an excursion of, not just

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.310
pi for one, but 2pi.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.020
And if you did this
experiment for awhile,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.610
you would convince
yourself there's

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:01.300
a magic relation between how
much the phase shift moves,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.800
and how many bound states

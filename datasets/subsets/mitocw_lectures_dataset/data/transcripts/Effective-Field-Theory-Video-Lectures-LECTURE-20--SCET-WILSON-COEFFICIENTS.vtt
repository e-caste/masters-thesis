00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280
IAIN STEWART: All right.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.165
So let's get started.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.900
So last time, we had
talked about factorization

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.180
in the effective theory.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.110
And there is one type
of factorization,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.860
which is this hard-collinear
factorization, which

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
is a factorization between the
low energy physics described

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.820
by the operator and the
Wilson coefficients.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.570
And we decided we
wanted to think

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.120
about that in the following
way, as having convolutions

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.300
between variables that appear
in the Wilson coefficients

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.743
and variables that
appear in the operator.

00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:54.410
And the way that we
can think about that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.050
is just what the most general
possible thing is that we can

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.660
write down for the Wilson
coefficients and of course,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.030
it can depend on large momenta.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.310
And so large momenta here
includes the label operator.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.380
So large momenta always show
up in Wilson coefficients

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.990
and in this case,
that includes momenta

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.640
that are the large
component, the order lambda 0

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.890
component of collinear fields.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:39.680
So this is hard-collinear
factorization

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.210
and it just comes out in
a natural, standard way

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.387
in this effective
theory because we've

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.720
set up the effective theory
to have the right low energy

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.265
degrees of freedom.

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:51.140
So even though it's a
little more complicated

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.240
than just a simple
product, we see

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.750
what the variables are that
can connect the two things just

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.800
by power counting, essentially.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.600
The large momenta are the
ones that are order lambda 0.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.358
We can do this generically
if we recall the definition

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:09.150
of our Wilson line.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.690
We can see how this
would carry over

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.970
to a generic case in
the following way.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.760
So that was one way of
defining the Wilson line.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.470
And as an operator, we
had relations as well.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:50.910
So we had this relation
and in particular, we

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.680
could take this to any power
and that just takes the p bar

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.420
to any power like that.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.100
So you can really
think of this as given

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.613
any function of this
operator i m bar

00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:09.950
dot d you can always write
that as a Wilson line,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.920
a function of p bar,
and a Wilson line.

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.200
And what you want to do is
you want to stick these Wilson

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.940
lines in the
operator and you want

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.180
to put this function in
the Wilson coefficient.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.840
So you could think, lets
me start with operator.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.720
I can throw in i m bar dot
d's because these guys are

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.102
order lambda 0, these are
collinear derivatives.

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:35.060
I could just allow it to
stick as many of those

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.280
as I like in my operator.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.440
But given that I put in
any function of them,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.540
I could always do
this and the right way

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.520
of thinking about it is
that this function here

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.040
is determined by matching.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.768
It's your Wilson coefficient.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.940
And that's what we were
effectively doing up here.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.600
But in some sense of
our general discussion

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.267
you can see that even if you had
multiple places in the operator

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.183
where you could insert
these derivatives, then

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:23.180
you would just do this.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.138
And what would happen is
at the end of the day,

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:28.160
you get a function of all
the possible large momenta

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.650
that you can form
from the operator.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.160
So maybe one more line.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.650
So think of it, you can
always separate out.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.940
Make a split like
we did over there

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.860
with the integral
over some variable

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.140
and then leave something that
you can stick in your operator,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.920
make it like this.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.600
So this could go in
the operator and then

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.288
that's the coefficient.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.030
AUDIENCE: If I stick
this in [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:16.480
IAIN STEWART: Well,
here I didn't write it.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.180
So if I wanted to
put in i m bar dot

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.710
d's, I'd stick them between.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.210
Right?

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.270
If I wanted to use the formula.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.870
If I wanted to use
this kind of logic

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.210
I wouldn't have
written this and I

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.994
would have said let me stick an
arbitrary function of i m bar

00:05:29.994 --> 00:05:30.750
dot d in here.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.812
AUDIENCE: But Between
before you even write--

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.770
IAIN STEWART: It has to
be between them because

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.973
of the gauge invariance.

00:05:35.973 --> 00:05:36.640
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.880
So before you write
down the Wilson line.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.320
So say you start and say, OK--

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.070
IAIN STEWART: Oh, yeah,
so there's still--

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.177
right.

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.010
Right, right, right.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.770
This Wilson line here
came from this h.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.500
So that's still
going to be true.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.440
And what I'm saying, if you
think about this operator,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.642
I could dress it up by
putting any function of i

00:05:54.642 --> 00:06:00.400
m bar dot d's right in here
because that would still be

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.945
same order and gauge invariant.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.570
AUDIENCE: OK, but
this an alternative--

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.010
IAIN STEWART: But then
if I use this formula,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.510
it would sort of push this w.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.910
That would cancel there
and then this w comes back

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.910
and then you get the if.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.245
OK.

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:24.370
So in general, the right
way of thinking about this

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.400
is as follows.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:38.488
We can encode this
in some notation

00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:42.890
by just setting up a convenient
set of building blocks

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.310
which are gauge
invariant objects

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.556
under the collinear
gauge transformations.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.160
And so we need to
have a fermion field,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.500
but we know that
the fermion field,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.370
generically we can make it
gauge invariant by multiplying

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.770
by Wilson line like that.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.910
And because of this, what we
were just discussing here,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.340
generically, we can be in
our Wilson coefficient,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.960
sensitive to the
momentum of this object.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:36.020
And so we can denote that by
defining the following thing,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.770
which is just a chi field that
carries some momentum which

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.545
is the overall large momentum
of this product of fields.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.910
And sometimes this guy goes by
the name of the quark jet field

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.790
because if you were to produce
a quark in the hard scattering

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.240
process, the quark would be
represented in your operator

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.980
by this w dagger c.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.380
The Wilson coefficients
would talk to that quark

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.290
through the large
momentum and that quark,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.200
in the low energy theory,
would evolve into a jet.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.310
So it goes by that name.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:16.590
You could also think
of it as a parton field

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.280
because as it turns out and
as we'll talk about later on,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.150
if you were to think about the
parton distribution function

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.460
and what pulls a quark
out of the proton,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.750
it's exactly this operator.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.900
And then that quark's
momentum, what

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.100
momentum that quark carries
is exactly picked out

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.539
by this delta function as well.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.740
So these are the
objects you'll usually

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.420
want to work in terms of.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:54.360
We can do something similar for
the gluon, which is a curly b

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.520
and I'm going to define it.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.070
If we wanted to get a
gluon, the natural thing

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.530
is to use a field strength
because then you get a gluon

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.480
without any derivatives.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.170
But I want my object
to be dimension one,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.830
so I'm going to define
it in the following way.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.030
So here's a field
strength commutator

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.220
of covariant derivatives, these
are collinear derivatives.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.980
And I throw Wilson lines around
it to make it gauge invariant,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.480
and then to make it dimension
one I throw in a 1 over p bar.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.690
And if you start
expanding this out,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.160
then the first term will
be the a n perp gluon

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
and so you have this b just has
a n perp gluon in the same way

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.440
that the first kind of
order term in this chi

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.140
is just to the fermion if
I set the Wilson line to 1.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.640
OK?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.743
So it's starting out as
a perpendicular gluon

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:55.160
but it's dressed up in a way
that makes it gauge invariant

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.940
in dimension one.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.410
And then just like we did here,
we can put a subscript on it

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:21.370
with a omega to say that we
fixed the large momentum of it

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.110
and sometimes there's a
convention that that's done,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.600
you have to decide if you
want the Wilson line--

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.540
I mean, the delta function
to be a w minus p bar or w

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.340
minus p bar dagger.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.840
Anyway, it doesn't really matter
that much because it's just

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.580
a sign of what you mean by a w.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.060
If it's an outgoing gluon,
this is a more convenient

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.760
convention.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.820
OK, and so this delta
function here and this p bar

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.890
here, when I put these
square brackets, what

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.590
I mean by that is that they
don't know how to act outside.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.740
They just act on the
operators inside.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:05.008
So these are objects
that exist by themselves

00:11:05.008 --> 00:11:06.800
and they don't care
about other things that

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.210
are multiplying them later.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.360
So that's the gluon
analog of the quark.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:29.670
So it turns out that we
can show the following.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.500
That if you want
to build operators

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.360
that are subleading
order, a complete set

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.375
of things to do
that is as follows.

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:44.990
It's this chi n, the
bn perp, and then you

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.930
could also need p perps.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.440
And then you could also
have ultrasoft fields,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.150
where it's really
kind of similar to how

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.317
you're used to building
operators in effective field

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:58.460
theories.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.040
But if you just want to talk
about the collinear sector,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.290
the only things you need are
this chi n this bn field,

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.230
and then p perps
and no other things.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.815
AUDIENCE: That's to
go just one order?

00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:07.010
IAIN STEWART: All orders.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.468
AUDIENCE: So why
aren't there any--

00:12:08.468 --> 00:12:11.320
IAIN STEWART: I'll
talk about it.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.937
Yeah.

00:12:11.937 --> 00:12:12.520
I'll show you.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.170
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.148
I mean, intuitively
you would think

00:12:16.148 --> 00:12:18.190
these are the physical
degrees of freedom, right?

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.147
There's two of them
so that's intuitive.

00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:22.480
But I'll show you how you get
rid of all the other ones.

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:34.517
It kind of matches up
with what you want.

00:12:34.517 --> 00:12:37.100
You could think that these are
the physical gluons that you're

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.500
producing and your operators can
be set up so that there's not

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.210
any spare use components.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.860
OK.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.280
So we'll get there.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.685
So let me introduce
a bit of notation.

00:12:58.622 --> 00:12:59.600
I have to do.

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:10.530
So let's consider this thing.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.905
A covariant
derivative sandwiched

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:15.810
with Wilson lines on
either side and this i dn

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.360
here is like p bar plus.

00:13:25.853 --> 00:13:27.770
So it just involves the
collinear gluon field.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.080
So then if I have that operator
and I just take n bar i dn,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.830
then that's p bar.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:46.280
if I take i dn perp
mu, then you can

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:54.990
show that this guy is p
perp u plus g bn perp mu.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.990
So this one is just a relation
we talked about before.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.770
This one is not as obvious,
but if you take this guy,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:08.030
you can let this derivative
p perp act on the Wilson line

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.990
or act through.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.150
If it acts through,
that's this term.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.810
If it acts on, then I can
manipulate the operator

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.590
so that it is exactly this form.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.420
And part of that comes
from the fact that--

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.830
I can explain it to you here.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.955
I have it in my notes and
you can look at it later,

00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:25.590
but let me just
explain it in words.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.423
If you looked at the
term in this commutator

00:14:27.423 --> 00:14:31.452
that was other order, where the
i m bar dot d was sitting here.

00:14:31.452 --> 00:14:32.660
It would hit the Wilson line.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.410
You'd get 0.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.910
So that term was
just put in to make

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:41.770
it look like a field strength.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.270
OK?

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.700
So really you have i m bar dot
d dn perp, without the comma,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.020
without the brackets.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:54.110
But then this combination
here, you can use the identity

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.653
that we had with it
and basically if you

00:14:56.653 --> 00:14:58.070
push this guy
through here, you're

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.640
canceling the p bar so it's
just giving you the Wilson line.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.420
So that's basically how
you go from here to here.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:06.920
OK?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.657
So basically what
this is saying is

00:15:12.657 --> 00:15:14.990
I don't need to consider
covariant derivatives because I

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.820
can instead consider
p perps and b

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.840
perps and that's equally good.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.900
OK.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:34.120
Now if you do a similar type
of thing in the n component,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.620
then you can derive a
similar type of object.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.200
So this is the same
object as we have

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.637
over here, but instead
of having an i dn perp,

00:15:40.637 --> 00:15:41.470
I'd have an n dot d.

00:15:50.782 --> 00:15:53.900
So d dot n perp
replaced n dot d.

00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:58.190
And that looks like
it could be something

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.450
that you'd build operators out
of and and also, furthermore,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.500
why not have operators that
depend on this n dot partial?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.000
OK?

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.180
So for p bar, we don't
have to worry about that.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.797
So OK, I said we'll include
this, we'll include that.

00:16:15.797 --> 00:16:17.880
I didn't say we have include
this, this, and this.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.963
So there's three things I
have to argue away here.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.440
The derivatives that
are p bars, those just

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.250
go into the Wilson coefficient.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:32.340
So if we had p bar chi n
comma omega, for example,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.810
then that's omega
chi n comma omega

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.940
and this is put into
the Wilson coefficient.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.580
So that's why we don't have
to worry about having p bars.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.970
In some sense, we
do have p bars.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.437
They're all in the
Wilson coefficients.

00:16:49.437 --> 00:16:51.020
So it's really these
other two that we

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.270
have to worry more
about and those actually

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.400
can be simplified using
the equation of motion.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.940
So if you have i n dot
p partial on chi n, then

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.280
equation of motion
when you write it out

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:14.110
in terms of these
objects, it has some form

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.235
and basically, you can just
get rid of those terms.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.470
So the equation of motion
allows us to get rid of i n dot

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.920
partials that are on chi n's.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.440
So that's why we don't
have to worry about those.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.110
And this is just like saying
that in our leading order

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.035
action, there wasn't
i n dot partial.

00:17:45.035 --> 00:17:46.410
But that's just
like saying there

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.400
was time derivatives
in our leading order

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.370
action in some standard
effective field theory.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.520
But then in the higher
dimension operators,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.270
you can always use the
equations of motion

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.650
to get rid of those
time derivatives.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.120
And here we're using
the equation of motion

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.560
to get rid of i n dot partial.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.310
So it appears in the
leading order action,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.790
but then we don't have to have
it in any other subleading

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.770
operator and that's why it's
not one of the ones that's

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.090
included in the list.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.690
And if you had i n dot
partial on curly b,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.490
that's also part
of the equations

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.750
of motion of the gluon field.

00:18:20.773 --> 00:18:22.690
Now when you do the gluon
equations of motion,

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.337
there's components
because it's a vector

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:26.920
and one of the other
components allows

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.370
you to get rid of the n dot b.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.528
So there's another term
that you can rearrange,

00:18:33.528 --> 00:18:36.070
and I won't write it out because
the equation is rather messy

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:42.370
but give you some idea.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.230
There's another
component that looks

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.078
like this where I can get rid
of all the n dot curly b's

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:55.120
using the gluon equation.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.650
So the gluon
equations of motions

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.480
allows me to get rid
of both of these things

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.230
and basically after
I've done that, I just

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.110
have the objects that
I've told you we can use.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.150
So after using
equations of motion,

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.800
we can get down
to those objects.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.220
And any other thing
that you might dream up

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.900
can be reduced to these objects.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.410
So I'm not saying that I went
through a complete list here.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.690
For example, what if you had
a commutator of 2 d n perps?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.190
Right?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.640
You might say, oh,
that's some new thing.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.390
It's one of these.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.598
You can also reduce that too.

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:05.230
So let me list that
one just to give you

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.650
some idea that there's others
you might think of dreaming up.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.310
So you can reduce all
of this to be that.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.040
OK, so for the
collinear sector this

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.010
is enough to build higher
dimension operators, just

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.350
these three.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:47.730
And then for the ultrasoft
sector, so I guess this is two.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:21:06.800
We do need ultrasoft derivatives
and ultrasoft field strengths

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.745
and ultrasoft quarks.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.700
So this part is really
just similar to the story

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.240
that you'd have for a standard
low energy effective field

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.830
theory.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.540
Like integrating out
a massive particle,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.998
you can use the
equation of motion.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.227
One thing that is
worth commenting about

00:21:32.227 --> 00:21:33.810
is the connection
between one and two.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.180
So one is collinear
and two is ultrasoft

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.400
and prior you might think, well,
they're totally independent.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.730
But we saw last time that
reparamaterization invariance

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.540
connects them.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.260
So if I've decided that
this is the type of basis

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.820
I want to use for
my operators, then

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.360
what is the
reparameterization connection?

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.970
You can rewrite what we
said last time in terms

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.850
of these curly d's because
it basically just means

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:02.310
moving the Wilson lines that we
had in this formula last time.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.558
They were around the
ultrasoft operator last time

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:08.850
and if I just move them over
to the collinear operator,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.500
then I get this curly d.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.000
Right?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.710
So the RPI connection
is connecting

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.757
the curly d collinear
to the d ultrasoft

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.340
and then you can write this guy
as the p perp plus the b perp.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.070
And likewise if you do the
same for the n bar sector

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.580
and you move the Wilson lines
from this term to that term,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.730
then it looks like
these two combinations.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.230
So that's just rewriting what
we had before but now in terms

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.915
of this type of notation.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.710
OK?

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.250
So that's enough to build
operators at higher order

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.893
and then we write down
Wilson coefficients

00:22:51.893 --> 00:22:54.310
for those operators that are
functions of a large momentum

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.970
and then we start doing
physics with them.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.200
So any questions about that?

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.160
AUDIENCE: For the
equations of motion,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.058
you always just use the leading
order equation of motion--

00:23:09.058 --> 00:23:09.850
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.350
AUDIENCE: --into a
higher order term?

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.892
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, these are
the L0 equations of the motion.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.070
That's what I'm doing
here or writing here.

00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:23.630
Yeah, there's one more actually.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:32.190
There's three but it's only
needed at some very high order.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.690
OK.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.780
So the next thing I
want to talk about

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.300
before we start doing
explicit examples

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.130
and going through
processes is how loops

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.690
work in this effective theory.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.360
And we're going to have to come
back and talk about our grid

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.490
that we have for the split
up of momenta and how

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:59.430
should we actually think
about it in practice

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.990
and then we'll also deal with
how matching and running work.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.400
So I'm going to do this in
the context of an example

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.920
and again, I'm just going to
pick the simplest example that

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.285
has only one jet just to make
our lives a little bit simpler.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:30.180
So we'll consider our
heavy, light current

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.750
and I think actually
once you see

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.970
how it works in
this example, you'll

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:38.500
understand what all the general
features are of doing loops

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.000
in SCET.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.190
So we had operators
that we constructed,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.767
lowest order operator.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.520
And let me write it
in this way which

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.010
was prior to making
our field redefinition.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.200
I could just write it
this way if I want.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:17.900
And gamma for beta s gamma
is a tensor operator.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:23.290
And there's a photon field,
which is a field strength,

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.230
f mu nu.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.708
So let's just think of
that as all part of gamma.

00:25:27.708 --> 00:25:29.800
OK, and that's
also appearing here

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.035
and I could use the spin
structure properties

00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.910
of these things to reduce
the sigma and mu nu

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.220
but that's not really going
to be part of our story

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.850
so let's not bother with that.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:40.540
So what I do?

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.480
I just compute the QCD
loops and the SCET loops

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.672
and I compare them.

00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:47.380
And if SCET is the
right effective theory

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.600
for this limit where I
have an energetic photon

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.310
and am back to back with
an energetic strange quark,

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.310
then I should match all
the infrared divergences

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.950
in that QCD
computation, I should

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.160
be able to extract a
matching coefficient,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.720
I should be able
to determine what

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.123
the C is from that
calculation, and I should

00:26:12.123 --> 00:26:13.290
be able to run the operator.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.650
I should be able to
make this into m s bar,

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.690
do some renormalization
of this operator,

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.530
and then do some renormalization
group evolution of that Wilson

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.541
coefficient.

00:26:25.632 --> 00:26:27.715
Well, let's just think
about computing the graphs.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.220
So we have to decide, when
we compute the graphs,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.890
how to regulate them?

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:40.500
Right?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.420
And we need to use the
same infrared regulator

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.720
in the full theory and
the effective theory.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.460
So here's how I'm
going to regulate them.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.430
We could do this
different ways and it's

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.120
useful to understand that
various answers that we get

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.807
are independent
of the regulator.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.410
So I'm going to take p
squared not equal to 0

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:03.570
for the strange quark.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.330
So there's infrared
divergences associated

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.300
with the strange
quirk and I'm going

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.450
to take p squared not
equal to 0 for them.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.840
I'm going to use dim
reg for the heavy quark.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.010
So I could take the b
quark to also be offshell.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.570
That would make the formulas
even more complicated.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.987
So instead of doing
that, I'm just

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.460
going to allow epsilon
to regulate the b quark.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.940
These guys are
pretty easy to track

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.000
so that won't be a problem.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.540
And I'm going to
use Feynman gauge.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.830
I don't have to do that,
but that's a nice gauge

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.480
for doing calculations.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.810
So what are the diagrams
where I have my photon

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.893
and I have a vertex
diagram like this

00:28:02.893 --> 00:28:04.810
and then I have wave
function renormalization?

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.800
And so let me, in the
usual kind of cavalier way,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.380
denote the wave function
renormalization, which

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.220
is just the multiplication
by the appropriate z factors.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.350
My diagram's like that.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.910
And this is a standard
QCD calculation

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.920
and we can carry it out.

00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:31.030
And what does the
answer look like?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:51.270
So this diagram
here has double logs

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:56.040
and single logs that
involve p squared, which

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:02.500
is our IR regulator, and then it
has some terms that are finite,

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.750
which I'll just note by--

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.390
so p here is the momentum of
our strange quark going out

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:15.090
and pb is the momentum
of our b quark coming in.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.110
And we're not going to talk
much about these finite terms

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:29.970
but what I mean
by finite here is

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.930
terms with no IR divergences.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.670
The IR divergences are these
single logs and double logs

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:41.070
and then there's some remainder
that I can write that way.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.060
I'm expanding it
for small p squared.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.060
So p squared is not
equal to 0 but I

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.770
take the limit p
squared goes to 0

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.230
and then that limit, these
are the IR singularities.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.560
And then there's some
function of b dot pb, which

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.010
is just an order one thing.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.020
And then b squared, of
course, is pb squared.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.145
So that's sort of the
remaining kinematic variables

00:29:58.145 --> 00:30:00.696
this could possibly depend on.

00:30:00.696 --> 00:30:03.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.138
IAIN STEWART: No.

00:30:04.138 --> 00:30:05.380
AUDIENCE: Is it finite?

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.960
IAIN STEWART: It's
really finite.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.890
So yeah.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.890
Yeah, so let's see.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.910
Yeah, I guess I carried
out the so there

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:26.380
is a z ten for the tensor
and when I write this--

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.560
yeah, let's see.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.630
So, OK.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.960
Let me do this.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.130
I think it's better.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.640
So I added up all these graphs
and I want to add one more.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.570
So there's a counterterm
for the tensor field.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.400
So let me change
what I was going

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.560
to say and do it this way.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.690
So the sum of these
four graphs is this.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.190
OK?

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.260
So there's no UV divergences.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.843
And I'll just tell you what the
z factors for these three are,

00:30:58.843 --> 00:31:00.677
then you could figure
out what this graph is

00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:01.800
by subtracting the two.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:15.440
So the tensor current in QCD
has a z factor, looks like that.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:28.070
There is a z for
the heavy quark.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.390
And if I include the
finite residue as well as

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:37.275
the divergent pieces,
this looks like this.

00:31:43.498 --> 00:31:45.040
I think I'm going
to have to make one

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.510
adjustment to my formula here.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.390
Let me just fix something here.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.230
Yeah.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:21.180
So if I want it to be the way I
say, then what do I have to do?

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:28.060
So this guy should
be three halves

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:33.000
and there will be
one more divergence.

00:32:36.904 --> 00:32:39.560
I think that's right.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.990
So this 2 over
epsilon ir here is

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.160
that 1 over epsilon ir
and the UV renormalization

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.550
is taken care of once
I have the z tensor.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.788
There's divergences in
this diagram in these ones.

00:32:51.788 --> 00:32:53.330
but there's one left
over, and that's

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.690
taken care of by z tensor.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:00.020
So there's no 1 over epsilon UVs
after I take care of this guy.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:15.170
So that's just by the definition
of what z tensor should be

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.030
and then everything
else is as I wrote.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.420
So there's either
divergences that

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.270
are associated to this strange
quirk offshellness, that's

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.960
these two terms.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.480
There's an IR divergence
associated, a heavy quark going

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.698
onshell, that's that term.

00:33:29.698 --> 00:33:30.990
And that's the sum of diagrams.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.950
OK, so what about SCET?

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.860
So there's going to be, in
SCET, collinear diagrams

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.510
and ultrasoft diagrams.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:14.560
So I'm going to use Feynman
gauge for everything again.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.020
This is not something
I have to do,

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.580
but this is what
I'm going to do.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.500
So let's start with
the ultrasoft loops.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:29.310
So there's a vertex graph.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:36.440
So using the notation that we've
adopted where the collinear

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.940
quarks are dashed and the
heavy quarks are double lines,

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.790
we have a diagram
that looks like that.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.210
There's some free factor.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.940
Let's focus on what
the loop looks like.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.590
So this loop here, the k
that's going through this loop

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.610
is just a residual k.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.690
There's no label k for
this loop because it's

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.640
an ultrasoft gluon.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.670
So when we write down all
the terms in this loop,

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.350
it's just standard field theory.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.780
There's nothing
special about it.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.890
Since I'm taking the
strange quirk offshell,

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.340
the propagator that I get is
this shifted iconal propagator

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.320
where basically the
fact that it's offshell

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.360
it gives me this
extra term there.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.840
That's regulating some
minor divergences.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.850
And we want that because we want
to regulate the IR divergences

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.920
in the same way in the full
theory of the effective theory.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.130
This is proportional to that
and if I put in all the factors.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.880
So it does have double
logs of the p squared,

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.128
doesn't have single
logs of the p squared,

00:36:24.128 --> 00:36:25.920
and actually if we look
at the double logs,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.363
the coefficients
also don't match

00:36:27.363 --> 00:36:28.530
with what we had over there.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.320
And so there's going to be
some other diagrams that

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.200
are going to involve double
logs of p squared as well.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.960
One thing that we
can note here is

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.578
that if you think about
the scales in the problem,

00:36:40.578 --> 00:36:42.370
remember that our loop
integral was totally

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.870
homogeneous in the
power counting,

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.480
the lambdas were
totally homogeneous.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.750
And if you think about
p squared scaling

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.840
like lambda squared,
which is natural size

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.740
for an external collinear
momentum, all right.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.000
If p squared scales
like lambda squared then

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.710
so does p squared
over m bar dot p.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.270
And this is a
dimension one thing

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.000
and this is the
ultrasoft scale, right?

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:22.445
For some ultra soft
momentum and so

00:37:22.445 --> 00:37:24.070
if you want to look
at these logarithms

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.890
and you ask, what scale is
this effective field theory

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.592
diagram sensitive to?

00:37:28.592 --> 00:37:30.175
It's sensitive to
the ultrasoft scale.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.710
So the logs are not
large logs, they're

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.020
order 1 logs as
long as mu squared

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.010
mu is of order
lambda squared, which

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.350
is the scale for the
ultrasoft momentum.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.653
And that's what we expect
from this ultrasoft diagram,

00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:53.070
that it's telling us about
physics at the ultra soft scale

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.980
and that's what we
see setting things

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.720
up, doing the calculation.

00:38:02.502 --> 00:38:04.710
So you could also think
about a wave function diagram

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.725
with an ultra soft
gluon, but this guy 0's

00:38:07.725 --> 00:38:14.580
out since in Feynman gauge you
just get n mu n mu, which is 0.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:20.955
So there's no so z for
the collinear quark

00:38:20.955 --> 00:38:24.540
field from an
ultrasoft loop is 0.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.340
That wouldn't necessarily
be true in some other gauge,

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.090
but in some other gauge this
diagram would also change.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.390
All the diagrams would change.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:35.040
And so if there was a non-zero
contribution in this diagram,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.600
it would just be taking
care of gauge invariance.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.560
And then finally,
there's ultrasoft loop

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.560
on the heavy quark.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.490
And that's an HQET
diagram, has nothing

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.000
to do with the collinear quark.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.450
So from that diagram
we would just

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:02.680
get the z factor, which is the
appropriate z factor in HQET

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.350
with r regulator.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.260
If I specify ultraviolet
and infrared divergences,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.020
that's this, and this
infrared divergence here

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.780
is actually exactly the same as
the one that we had over here.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.890
OK, so the ultrasoft
sector, there's

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.300
nothing really tricky about it.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.423
It's just write down the
diagrams, do the loops.

00:39:32.423 --> 00:39:33.840
AUDIENCE: So for
the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.510
isn't that IR divergences
of those diagrams

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.070
cancel with every
automation [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:43.352 --> 00:39:45.310
IAIN STEWART: So what
are we looking at, right?

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.560
So it depends on what
we're looking at here.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.778
And so, yes, in general
that would be true, right?

00:39:52.778 --> 00:39:54.820
If you were calculating
some cross-section, which

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.727
was IR finite
cross-section and that,

00:39:57.727 --> 00:39:59.560
of course, would depend
on defining what you

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.580
mean by measuring this quark.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.080
Right?

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.360
So the IR divergence would
become some physical scale

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.330
like the mass of a jet.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.360
The IR divergences would
turn into something physical

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.420
if you put this into a
physical cross-section.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.280
And that's exactly
basically what would happen.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.310
These p squareds would
become the mx squareds

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.665
that we talked about when we
talked about beta s gamma.

00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:29.290
But here what we're
interested in doing

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.650
is a matching calculation.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.940
So we fix the
external state, still

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.097
have a particular
number of partons,

00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:37.180
and we want to compare the
full theory calculation

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:37.930
with the effective theory.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.472
The effective theory
should reproduce

00:40:39.472 --> 00:40:41.530
the infrared divergences.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.510
So really all we
care about is not

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.090
that this is infrared
finite, but rather

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:52.533
that the effective theory has
the same infrared divergences.

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:53.950
And we'll see that
in the end when

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.908
you can think about is
rather than canceling in

00:40:55.908 --> 00:40:58.890
for divergences as you're
thinking in the full theory,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.080
we've matched the full theory
onto the effective theory

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.653
and that matching gives
us the Wilson coefficient.

00:41:04.653 --> 00:41:07.070
And then we take effective
theory and all the cancelations

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.487
that you're thinking about
between real and virtual graphs

00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:11.690
will occur in the
effective theory too.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.730
So you can just think
about the effective theory

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.490
virtual-real graphs, then the
cancelation will take place

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:17.610
there.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.610
But then you're thinking
about that cancelation

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.140
later, at a lower scale,
which is what you actually

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.640
want to do.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.890
Because what I just was
telling you about IR

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.720
divergences becoming different
things in the final state

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.840
becomes very trivial once
you're in the effective theory

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:38.280
and we'll see sort of exactly
how that works later on.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.080
But first we have to
talk about linear graphs.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.350
So in the collinear
graphs we had

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.960
graphs like this one where
we can take a gluon out

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.560
of the vertex here.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.923
That corresponds to taking
it out of the Wilson line.

00:41:59.923 --> 00:42:01.840
So let's label the graph
in the following way.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:07.380
This would be k plus p this
will be p This will be k.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.880
And if we follow our
rules for what this is,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:20.460
we would write a sum over
labels and then an integral

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.830
over residuals.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.330
And let me put the
residual integral

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.550
in dimensional organization.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:43.800
Let me try to squeeze
in everything,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800
which won't be possible.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.830
So I'm going to write
out the components

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.450
to make clear whose
residual on whose label.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.940
So in the denominator
there's one more term.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.220
So the plus guys
are always residual,

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.980
the perp and the minuses
are always labeled.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.940
The short way of saying what
I'm trying to squeeze in here.

00:43:25.087 --> 00:43:27.420
So the denominator has these
three terms, this guy here,

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.795
this guy here,
and this guy here.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.360
And when I label the
diagram like this,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.100
you should think
that each of these

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.690
has a label and residual part.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.980
So k you can think of as a pair,
k label, k residual for now.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.383
And remember the
importance of doing this.

00:43:57.383 --> 00:43:59.050
The importance of
doing this was related

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.660
to always being able to
identify what the lowest order

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.190
term was on the right here.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.690
OK?

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.357
And that actually
becomes more important

00:44:06.357 --> 00:44:08.632
once you start to think
about diagrams where

00:44:08.632 --> 00:44:10.840
you would add like an extra
ultrasoft gluon somewhere

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.740
in this picture.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.240
Then, of

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.100
Course when that ultrasoft
gluon feeds its way

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.475
through this loop,
you gotta make

00:44:16.475 --> 00:44:20.320
sure that it's only the lowest
order piece that's showing up.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.370
In this case here, we
just have a collinear loop

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:28.960
and we don't have any
sort of real ultrasoft

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:34.930
momenta from ultrasoft particles
besides the heavy quark, which

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.708
is just an external
particle to the loop.

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.250
So what we want to
do with this is we

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.940
want to turn it back
into an integral.

00:45:02.496 --> 00:45:03.880
Just let me say it this way.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.050
And if it wasn't for
these restrictions here,

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:15.210
then that's very easy, actually.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.740
and then I'll talk
about why it's true.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.270
I claim that if we
ignored the restrictions

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.610
and those restrictions are
ensuring that we don't double

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.320
count between our collinear
and our ultrasoft degrees

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:28.820
of freedom.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.290
So they are important, but
let's ignore them for a minute.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:44.315
If we do ignore them, we
would just get the following.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.060
Where I just basically stop
thinking about residuals

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.660
and labels, write everything
as a full momentum,

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.960
and write down exactly the
same thing I just wrote.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.450
So this is a full
k squared and this

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.010
is a full k plus p squared.

00:46:07.502 --> 00:46:08.002
OK?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.420
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to first ignore

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.300
these restrictions
and then I'm going

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.710
to tell you how it would
work, how this actually

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.720
does turn into this.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.212
What are the rules
for doing that.

00:46:23.212 --> 00:46:24.920
And then I'll come
back and I'll tell you

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.800
what these extra conditions do.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:35.270
So really this looks
like maybe it's trivial,

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.060
but we should think about it.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.410
And it's almost
trivial but not quite.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.650
So really what
we're doing here is

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.620
we're combining back together
labels and residual momentum,

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.493
right?

00:46:46.493 --> 00:46:48.410
And the place that we
have to worry about that

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.450
is in the perp in
the minus space.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:56.530
And recall we had
the grid and the grid

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:00.980
is sort of our way of
guiding, our guidance

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.820
to see how to put
things back together.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.090
So we had vectors that
lived in this space

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.760
and this is the label
and then there's

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.500
the residual, if we want
to point to some place

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.160
in that space.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:25.710
This picture was like a
Wilsonian effective field

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:29.340
theory because the picture
makes you think of sharp edges.

00:47:36.613 --> 00:47:38.530
But the real effective
theory that we're doing

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:42.700
is a continuum one
and so you have

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.170
to expand your
brain a little bit

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.170
and think that each of
the boxes in this picture

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.923
is actually an
infinite space as well,

00:47:49.923 --> 00:47:52.090
because the residual space
doesn't have restrictions

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.210
like that that would
spoil Lorentz symmetry.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:27.560
So each grid point really is
specifying an infinite space

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.600
of residual momenta.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:40.810
And it's R4 or Minkowski space,
so the momenta components

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:46.718
are real numbers and
there's some rules.

00:48:46.718 --> 00:48:47.635
So what are the rules?

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:03.240
So I'll tell you what the
rules are without restrictions

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.093
for now and then we'll
come back and I'll

00:49:06.093 --> 00:49:08.010
tell you what the rules
are with restrictions.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.810
So rule number one
is the simplest,

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.890
and it just says that
say I had the following,

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.250
I'll use a one
dimensional notation.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.580
Say I had a sum over kl's and
an integral over all kr's.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.710
Well that's just the same
as not having split it up

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.110
and doing an integral
over everything.

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:36.770
Because we split this thing
into boxes and if we really

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:41.238
integrate over all boxes
and sum over all labels,

00:49:41.238 --> 00:49:43.280
then we should just get
back the full integration

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.155
over all the momenta.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.185
So that's true for each,
for minus and perp momenta.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:59.010
But really what we have to
do is we have to do this

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.270
with some integrand, right?

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:05.790
So the type of integrand
that we have is following.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:12.070
If you think about
the components

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.040
that we're talking about here,
which are the minus and perp

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.580
ones, then in our
integrand up there,

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.150
there's no minus
or perp residuals.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.555
So it's just a
function of the labels.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:37.080
Right?

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.580
And so what that
says effectively

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:43.720
is that this is a constant
function in this box,

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.595
in each of the boxes.

00:50:49.675 --> 00:50:52.050
And effectively, the way that
you use this formula is you

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.830
do the following.

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:56.345
You say, well, if it's a
constant function in the box,

00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:58.470
I could evaluate it at a
different point in the box

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.743
and I'd still get
the same value.

00:51:00.743 --> 00:51:02.160
So in particular,
I could evaluate

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.340
it k label plus k
residual and then I

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.560
can use that
formula there to say

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:12.810
that this is just an
integral with a continuous k

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.970
of the function evaluated
at that continuous k.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.332
So that's the way
that number one works.

00:51:28.332 --> 00:51:30.790
We are integrating functions
that are constant in the boxes

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:33.130
and so then it's
kind of trivial,

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.120
how to put the
boxes back together.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.620
Yeah?

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.600
AUDIENCE: So this d kl division
doesn't have kl plus--?

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.830
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, so
what I mean by it is--

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.330
yeah.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:48.280
So I'm using here for each
minus or perp momenta,

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.000
one dimensional notation.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.860
Yeah, and so I have
three of these.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.150
I have to do this.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.733
And for each one of them it's
true that what I'm saying.

00:51:56.733 --> 00:51:58.900
But of course, if I tried
to write that on the board

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.700
then it would confuse
the point, I think,

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.070
which is, in some
sense, a simple point.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:05.620
OK?

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.910
So this is, in
some sense, saying

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.680
that this whole split
up that we were doing

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.597
was not really needed.

00:52:09.597 --> 00:52:12.400
We could've just written a
continuous integral and that's

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.780
kind of what this
is saying, right?

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.780
We could have just written
a continuous interval

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.572
and not worried so much
about all the split

00:52:18.572 --> 00:52:20.080
up that we were doing.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.240
The place that we have
to be careful about

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.483
is these restrictions, and
we'll come back to that.

00:52:24.483 --> 00:52:26.650
And the other place that
we have to be careful about

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.450
is when you have the
multiple expansion.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:32.170
But as long as you take care
of that, then basically this

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:36.080
is always happening.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.663
So the reason why this
works is the following.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.580
For every label loop momentum
that there is in any diagram,

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:09.610
there's always going to be some
corresponding residual that's

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:14.950
not specified by delta functions
in terms of external momenta.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:18.850
And effectively, therefore
that we can absorb in order

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:19.960
to do what we just said.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.170
So we can always go back from
this discrete type notation

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.737
back to a continuous notation.

00:53:30.737 --> 00:53:32.320
The discrete notation
was just helping

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.132
us to set up the expansion
and be careful about it,

00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:37.090
but we can always go back
to the continuous one

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.805
because there's always a
kr that has this property.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.060
OK.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.523
So now in general
though, you might have

00:53:55.523 --> 00:53:56.690
some more complicated thing.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.315
And if I'm going to
give you some rules

00:53:58.315 --> 00:54:00.950
I should give you
a complete set.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:06.920
So we have to append our list
of rules by the following one.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.110
So if I thought about doing
what I just said over here

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.060
but I went to some higher
order, then what could happen?

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:26.190
Well then these kr minus and
kr our perps could show up.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.650
They'd never show up in the
denominator of our propagators

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:30.710
if they were just
collinear propagators,

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.840
but they could show up at
some point in the numerator.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.070
And we need actually a rule like
this one, which would be clear

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.950
if we were regulating d kr in
dimensional regularization,

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.920
that the power of divergences
are getting set to 0.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.190
And that is basically to
maintain the run symmetry

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:52.760
in the residual space we
need a rule like this for j

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.540
greater than 0.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.170
So that doesn't come
into our calculation,

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:22.080
but included for completeness.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.860
So when would these
integral kr actually do

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.300
something non-trivial?

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.770
It would do
something non-trivial

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.960
if we had an ultrasoft
loops and collinear

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.060
loops at the same time.

00:55:44.677 --> 00:55:46.760
So in the case where we
just have collinear loops,

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.120
it's basically up to this
issue about the restrictions

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.230
that we'll talk about.

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.370
It's basically
that we just could

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.787
have done everything
as continuous

00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:58.040
and ignored this split.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.000
But if we have both
ultrasoft particles that

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:25.690
are participating through the
loops and/or then in general

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:28.930
these will give
non-trivial loop momenta

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.470
in the residual momenta.

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.530
And hence there will be
some that we can't just

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.210
absorb in the fashion
that we just said.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:41.830
So there will be, in this
situation, residual momenta.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.350
Some residual momenta will
be absorbed in the same way

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.085
to turn the integrals
into continuous ones,

00:56:47.085 --> 00:56:48.460
but other ones
won't be absorbed.

00:56:59.078 --> 00:57:01.120
And that's because the
ultrasoft propagators rate

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.680
would involve the lr plus,
the lr minus, and the lr perp

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.380
in the denominator, so we
don't have this rule to apply.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.590
We can't do what we said
here with the constant boxes

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.750
because now the functions are
depending on that variable.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.600
So we just have to
do the integral.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:23.655
So you could have something
that looks like just

00:57:23.655 --> 00:57:26.630
in a schematic formula.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.540
Let's have there
be 2 kr and an lr.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.950
We're in kind of an
obvious notation.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.680
I'm saying that the function
could depend on lr residual,

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.500
it doesn't depend
on kr residual.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.170
So we absorb kr back into
the sum to make it continuous

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:42.920
and then this integral
we just have to do.

00:57:54.076 --> 00:57:58.245
OK, but we're still, in the
end, just doing an integral.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:11.300
So this guy come from ultrasoft
propagators, for example.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:17.330
OK?

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:20.180
So those are the different
cases that you can get.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.097
But nevertheless, even if
you have ultrasoft particles

00:58:23.097 --> 00:58:24.680
and propagators
floating around, there

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.920
will always be a residual
momentum associated to

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.990
of what we were doing
over here that you

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:35.610
can absorb in the
same way I stated,

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.262
so let's proceed along these
lines and see where it takes us

00:58:38.262 --> 00:58:39.720
and then we'll come
back and put in

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.960
this additional restrictions.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.040
AUDIENCE: Do we ever have
to do a discrete sum?

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.310
Like is there a sum over ll?

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.476
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, so you
never have to do a discrete sum.

00:58:51.476 --> 00:58:52.393
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:58:52.393 --> 00:58:54.598
IAIN STEWART: Yep.

00:58:54.598 --> 00:58:56.640
The discrete sum is really
just a way of thinking

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.760
and I'll show you in
a minute that you even

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.620
can avoid thinking about it
once you know what to do.

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.480
So it's guiding you
towards the right answer

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.063
but it's not really
something that you

00:59:06.063 --> 00:59:07.860
have to think about
this grid picture.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.490
It's really just if
you get confused,

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.340
you can always think about it
but if you're not confused,

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.715
you don't have to
think about it.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:28.300
OK, so this guy is what we said,
proportional to what we said.

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:38.030
It's just in this case, the
reason why it was so simple

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:42.230
is because k residual is
one component of this guy,

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.980
and then there's these
other three, right?

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.677
And the other three,
we just absorb

00:59:46.677 --> 00:59:48.260
the sum and the
integral back together

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.510
and there's nothing
further to talk about.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:56.600
So that's why this is, in
some sense, very simple.

00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.480
So we just do that,
and what do we get?

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:27.190
Get some 1 over epsilons, we
get some logs of p squared,

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.678
and I'm putting in
even the constant term

01:00:30.678 --> 01:00:31.720
since it's pretty simple.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.760
4 minus pi squared over 6.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.160
So if you think about
where this came from,

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.470
there was a place
that this Wilson line

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.250
came from was attaching
this guy over here

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:47.050
and then integrating out
that offshell propagator.

01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:48.442
So this is a vertex diagram.

01:00:48.442 --> 01:00:50.650
We had a vertex diagram,
which is an ultrasoft gluon,

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:53.410
and now we've added an
identical type up topology.

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.870
Except we drew it
different because this line

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.515
was offshell so we drew
it as a Wilson line

01:00:58.515 --> 01:01:00.440
and that's the right way
of thinking about it.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.253
But if you think about
where it came from,

01:01:02.253 --> 01:01:03.670
it was the same
topology and we've

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.840
added another vertex diagram.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.540
So the effective
theory has two type

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.142
of vertex diagrams,
this collinear

01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:10.600
one and the ultrasoft
one and we're

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.640
going to add them together.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.100
And in this one,
you see the logs

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.170
are minimized at a
different scale, mu squared

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:19.690
of order p squared, which is
the right scale for a collinear

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.190
loop.

01:01:24.032 --> 01:01:25.740
Because remember, the
collinear particles

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:32.730
lived at a larger p squared
than the ultrasoft ones.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.010
So there's a larger scale that
would minimize these loops,

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.010
it's a collinear scale.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.530
So the effective theory
is capturing the physics

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:45.280
at that scale.

01:01:48.577 --> 01:01:50.290
Squeeze in another diagram here.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.590
If we do the collinear wave
function renormalization,

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:57.610
then this is non-zero.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:00.040
This was 0 for the
ultrasoft gluon

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.890
and but for the collinear
gluon, it's non-zero

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:06.190
and it's exactly, actually,
the same as the full theory.

01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:12.370
It's the same as massless QCD.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.090
So you can do the diagram
using the effective theory

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:23.500
Feynman rules, then
that's what you find.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.510
But you could also
understand why that's true.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.480
And reason why it's true is
nothing in this diagram really

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.230
specifies a frame.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.880
We called all the
particles collinear,

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.755
but it's not
attached to anything.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.380
So we could just take
the whole diagram

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.268
and boost back to the frame
where everything's kind of soft

01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:46.560
and then we would usually be
thinking about it in terms

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.650
of a full theory field.

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:56.640
So that's effectively
why this diagram

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.323
like this that doesn't have
any reference, unlike this one

01:03:00.323 --> 01:03:01.740
which has a reference
because it's

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.470
attached to the heavy quark.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.850
That's why it's the same as QCD.

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:13.695
Yeah?

01:03:13.695 --> 01:03:15.820
AUDIENCE: How do you know
what the epsilon position

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.460
for the Wilson line is set?

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.160
IAIN STEWART: Oh, for this one?

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.077
AUDIENCE: m bar dot k.

01:03:19.077 --> 01:03:21.270
IAIN STEWART:
Yeah, for this one.

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:27.570
Yeah, for this guy it actually
doesn't depend on the i epsilon

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:31.160
prescription up to a--

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.247
yeah, if I remember correctly.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.010
Yeah.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.080
That's true, I
believe, when I'm being

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.710
a little bit cavalier with it
but once I put it the zero bin

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:48.922
restrictions, I'm not sure
if that's true anymore.

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:50.628
AUDIENCE: OK?

01:03:50.628 --> 01:03:51.420
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.670
I mean, really what solves
that is that in a minute

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.870
I'm going to be
talking about the fact

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.355
that there is a
subtraction term here

01:03:56.355 --> 01:03:58.063
and once you put the
subtraction term in,

01:03:58.063 --> 01:03:59.370
that i0 is not relevant.

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.240
But I think even if you do this
diagram with arbitrary i0--

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:14.308
because what's happening
is m bar dot k going to 0

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.100
is related to some of
these 1 over epsilons

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.930
and we'll talk about
that more in a minute.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.320
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.512
It could be that there's
some sign that might flip.

01:04:30.512 --> 01:04:32.330
I'm not 100% sure.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:34.610
AUDIENCE: Even if they
get the wrong side,

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:36.110
the difference would
be subtraction.

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:39.080
IAIN STEWART: I
guess I know that--

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.100
yeah.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.750
What I know is that--

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.520
yeah, let me answer
your question later.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.540
It'll be easier
because I'm trying

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.430
to say a bunch of things
that depend on something else

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:47.638
that I haven't explained yet.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.087
So what are the other possible
topologies we could write down?

01:04:54.087 --> 01:04:55.670
So we could write
down this one, where

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.500
we take two attachments
in the Wilson line

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.870
and just loop them
back up but that's

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.620
proportional m bar
squared and so that's

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.980
0 in our Feynman gauge.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.750
And likewise, there's a
looping back up in the vertex

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.700
in the wave function
renormalization,

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:21.520
but this guys scale is power
law divergent and so we can just

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.735
set it to 0 and dim reg.

01:05:24.735 --> 01:05:26.110
You don't have to
worry about it.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.700
OK, so that's all the diagrams.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.595
Let's think about
doing matching,

01:05:35.595 --> 01:05:39.508
i.e let's think about comparing
QCD and SCET by adding up

01:05:39.508 --> 01:05:40.050
the diagrams.

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:52.050
In QCD we carried out
the randomization,

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:55.670
we added the z for
the tensor current.

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:59.160
Let me just write again
the answer looked like.

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.090
In SCET we didn't carry
out renormalization yet,

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:26.450
so let me call this the
bare SCET result for now.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.670
Once we add the ultrasoft and
collinear diagrams together,

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:39.880
the logs of p squared match up
exactly with the full theory.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:51.243
So this is the first sign
really that it makes sense

01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:52.910
to be thinking about
adding these loops.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:54.830
Even though they were
the same topology,

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:58.235
we are correctly
reproducing those logs of p

01:06:58.235 --> 01:06:59.360
squared in the full theory.

01:07:03.677 --> 01:07:05.135
And then there's
some other pieces.

01:07:22.222 --> 01:07:23.680
I'll write out all
the other pieces

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.262
so you see what they look like.

01:07:26.262 --> 01:07:28.220
Well, maybe I won't I
won't write the constant.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.890
So there's all the effective
field theory terms.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:49.710
So these terms here we can
match up with these terms here.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.050
So that's good.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:08:00.363
These terms here, which remember
in the full theory were finite,

01:08:00.363 --> 01:08:02.530
and these terms here, which
in the effective theory,

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:04.300
are finite, the
difference of those

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.207
is going to give the
Wilson coefficient.

01:08:23.915 --> 01:08:25.540
Now we said that the
Wilson coefficient

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.720
could be a function of p bar,
so what's going on with that?

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.109
Well, if you look at
momentum conservation

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:36.024
in this process
of beta s gamma--

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:39.450
so I probably should've
said this earlier.

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:40.970
So when you look
at beta s gamma,

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.399
if you look at momentum
conservation then

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.220
the p minus of the
strange quark has

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.109
to be equal to the p
minus of the b quark,

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:51.340
but that's just mb.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:55.670
OK, so actually p minus is
equal to mb by kinematics.

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:03.080
So mb's in this result
here you shouldn't think

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.640
of as p minuses, and that's this
p bar that was in our Wilson

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.529
coefficient is just
getting set to mb

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:14.240
because of some delta functions
that are specifying kinematics.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.149
So that leaves the 1
over epsilon terms.

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:19.370
And so what we'd like
is that those terms are

01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.412
associated to renormalization.

01:09:27.588 --> 01:09:28.880
Of the effective theory, right?

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.689
I wrote that the
effective theory was bare.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:49.899
But if I want to do
that, then I have

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.540
to ensure that all
these epsilons that

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.910
are appearing here are really
ultraviolet divergences.

01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:59.610
If they're infrared
divergences, then doing that

01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:01.850
doesn't make sense.

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:04.380
And that's actually
the remaining issue

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.080
that we have to deal with.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.120
I just wrote epsilon, that means
I'm ignorant to what they are.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.692
And if I knew this
one was epsilon

01:10:11.692 --> 01:10:13.400
IR because it came
from the wave function

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.817
renormalization
of the heavy quark

01:10:14.817 --> 01:10:16.830
and that was the
same on both sides.

01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:19.200
It was the same diagram,
it was the wave function

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.742
renormalization diagram in the
full and the effective theory.

01:10:21.742 --> 01:10:23.220
So I could match up that one.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.130
These ones just came
out, but it turns out

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:28.890
that so far with what we've
done, some of these epsilon

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.330
here are IR.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:37.912
And so the IR divergences
aren't matching up

01:10:37.912 --> 01:10:39.370
and the reason is
because we didn't

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:43.295
put in those restrictions
on our sum over labels.

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:27.120
OK.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.250
So we have these restrictions,
k label not equal to zero

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.080
and k label not
equal to minus pl.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.750
Those are the restrictions
that I'm talking about.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.700
The place that those
restrictions came from

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.390
was k was the
momentum of the gluon.

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.620
kl not equal to 0 is saying
that this is the restriction

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.486
that the gluon is collinear.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.810
Because kl equals 0
is the ultrasoft gluon

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:01.900
and this is the restriction
that the fermion is

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:08.240
collinear in the loop and that's
why there was two of them.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.510
So these are called zero bins.

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:20.710
Zero because it's where the
ultrasoft momentum lives

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:23.590
and from the point of view
of collinear, that's zero.

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:31.840
Imposing these restrictions
is removing the zero

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.750
bin, if you like and what
these restrictions do

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:39.220
is they avoid double
counting and the way I've

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.860
said it that's, I think, clear.

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:46.780
So far in our calculation we
haven't avoided double counting

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.738
and that's the problem.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:04.910
OK.

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:07.280
So we have to modify
our rule or we

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.040
extend our rule to
include the case where

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.627
we have these restrictions.

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:23.243
In an extended version of rule
two that house restrictions.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.616
So really what we
want to do is that

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:44.633
and we want to think
about that as an integral.

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:46.550
So here's how we can
manipulate these to think

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:49.440
about it as an integral.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:57.930
That sum over all
kl's, but then we'll

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:12.990
subtract the limit of
this f where we take the f

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.140
and we let the kl
go to the place.

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.480
So we integrate over
everywhere, including the place

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.200
we don't want to go, and
then we subtract it back.

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:26.550
So what is this fl of k?

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.230
This f of kl goes to 0.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:43.910
it's defined by taking the
scaling limit of the collinear

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.100
momenta towards the ultrasoft.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.780
So you take your
collinear momenta,

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.060
which are the minus
in the perp here,

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.720
and you scale them towards an
ultrasoft momentum in whatever

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.760
components, i.e you start
counting the kn's as order

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:18.617
lambda squared and you keep
the leading order piece

01:15:18.617 --> 01:15:20.950
or you keep the piece that's
the same size as this term.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.530
And then that defines
what this f is.

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:40.510
Once you take that
limit and you expand,

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.950
then that's what the f is.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:53.120
So what you're doing here
by doing this procedure

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.280
is you're basically
setting things up

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.540
so that this guy is
integrated over in a way

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.460
that we can combine
back into an integral.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:04.130
But then we have to
subtract an overlap

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:07.645
of when that integral would
go into the ultrasoft region.

01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:09.020
But the overlap
we're subtracting

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:20.288
is also an integral, so we
have a difference of integrals.

01:16:20.288 --> 01:16:22.080
And you should think
of the second integral

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.120
as integrating over the
square where the zero bin was.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.730
So if you think
about our picture

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:33.150
where the collinears were up
here, ultrasofts are down here

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:36.390
and you thought about
there being some box,

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.850
you're taking this scaling
limit when this guy goes down

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.730
into that box.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.220
You add up all the
boxes, that's this,

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.360
and then you subtract
out that box again.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.350
And that avoids having a
double counting in that region.

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:58.490
So then this guy here, you
can do the same kind of trick

01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:59.190
as before.

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:02.165
So continuing with the equation.

01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:21.100
kl is going to 0, well, we can
think of it just as a function

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.867
of kr's.

01:17:22.867 --> 01:17:24.700
And so effectively what
we get in the end is

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.600
an integral over
all k of f of k,

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.920
the full f, evaluated
with a continuous momentum

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:39.190
minus some f that's
expanded and avoids there

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:41.570
being overlap in this box.

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.600
So rather than having
these discrete sum

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.700
with the restriction, we have
a difference of integrals

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.260
and this subtraction term avoids
the overlap in that region.

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.620
So all the discrete
sums are good for is

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:59.020
a means of figuring out
what limits you need to take

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.682
to generate these subtractions.

01:18:00.682 --> 01:18:02.140
Once you've done
that, everything's

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.100
a continuous integral.

01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:24.941
And this is called the
zero bin subtraction.

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:39.120
OK, so if you like, one way
of phrasing what's going on

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.580
is that the collinear
propagators are really

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.750
distributions.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:46.560
They're distributions
that know that they should

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.290
have a subtraction in order to
not overlap the other region

01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:51.423
where we have another
degree of freedom.

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:52.840
So you can think
about it that way

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.740
and having this sum it's
just a way of encoding that.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.150
But in the end, it looks like
some kind of plus function

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:02.745
where you have a subtraction.

01:19:02.745 --> 01:19:04.620
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like in the second term

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:08.540
you would have to relearn the
expression because initially

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.240
in the [INAUDIBLE] k you
ignore kr minus and kr perps.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.070
IAIN STEWART: I'll show you
how it works in an example

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.570
up there.

01:19:18.015 --> 01:19:19.140
So let's go to our example.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.357
Yeah, so what you just
said is not quite the way

01:19:27.357 --> 01:19:28.440
you should think about it.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.982
You should think
about it that you've

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:31.920
given the effective
theory f and now

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.910
I'm saying that that f, as
given, with its momentum as

01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:39.510
given still has an overlap
with the ultrasoft region

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:41.380
that I want to subtract.

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.080
So I'm taking a
limit of that f, I'm

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.370
not add anything back to it.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:50.550
So this guy, integral dk.

01:19:58.952 --> 01:20:00.285
So this is what we wrote before.

01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:09.785
And now if I take the ultrasoft
limit of it, of the k,

01:20:09.785 --> 01:20:10.785
then I would write this.

01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:23.370
OK?

01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:26.610
So when I take
the scaling limit,

01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:28.560
if you think about
k squared, k plus,

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.650
k minus, minus k perp squared,
when I take the scaling

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:33.490
limit of all momentum
being ultrasoft,

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.910
the components of the k
are still homogeneous.

01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:38.430
So there's nothing
there to expand.

01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:41.610
Some expansion happened
in this k plus p term.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:44.160
One of our n bar dot k
changes its power counting,

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.427
but it's still n bar dot k.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:48.760
There's nothing to expand there.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.010
So this is what the
subtraction looks

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:51.576
like and then the
numerator, the n bar dot

01:20:51.576 --> 01:20:53.326
k can be dropped
relative to the n bar dot

01:20:53.326 --> 01:20:56.695
p, which is large and external.

01:20:56.695 --> 01:20:59.400
OK, so this is taking the
ultrasoft limit of this.

01:21:03.176 --> 01:21:04.828
AUDIENCE: Do you
have to subtract off

01:21:04.828 --> 01:21:07.385
the the ultrasoft limit
of the quark as well?

01:21:07.385 --> 01:21:08.760
IAIN STEWART:
Yeah, so in general

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.427
I would have to subtract off the
ultrasoft limit of the quark as

01:21:11.427 --> 01:21:12.490
well.

01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:14.220
And when I do that,
what I find is

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.940
a term that's power
suppressed and so I drop it.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.940
But in general, I would
have to do that as well.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:20.482
That's right.

01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:26.450
And so it looks like
an ultrasoft diagram

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:31.100
except it's got this n bar
dot k inside of the v dot k

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.082
that we had in the
ultrasoft diagram.

01:21:34.082 --> 01:21:36.290
And if you do a power counting
with the loop momentum

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:38.540
scaling as ultrasoft, then you
have this piece is of the order

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.123
the same size as
this piece and that's

01:21:40.123 --> 01:21:42.287
why you keep only that term.

01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:44.454
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
worry about a higher power?

01:21:44.454 --> 01:21:45.290
IAIN STEWART: No.

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:49.090
So the prescription we have is
that we drop the higher powers

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:50.820
AUDIENCE: But if
I were to do say--

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.778
IAIN STEWART: Oh, if you
did the higher power--

01:21:52.778 --> 01:21:54.890
AUDIENCE: --lower power
higher power zero bin?

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:55.920
IAIN STEWART: No.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.870
So if we did the
higher power, then this

01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:59.707
would start out at higher power.

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.290
And then when we
took the limit of it,

01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:04.650
it would end up just starting
at that power or higher.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:06.210
AUDIENCE: Right,
but there was a--

01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:07.860
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
you don't have to.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.160
No.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:08.702
AUDIENCE: No?

01:22:08.702 --> 01:22:09.720
IAIN STEWART: No.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.220
Yeah.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.870
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason?

01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:14.520
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
so really what

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.000
you care about subtracting
here are the log divergences

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.640
and that's what this minimal
subtraction is doing.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.910
By keeping the piece that's
scaling the same way,

01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:26.490
you're removing the
log divergent pieces.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:28.260
And it's the log
divergent pieces which

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:31.500
are giving one of our epsilons.

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:35.050
The pieces that you would get
from the higher expansion,

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.467
they would all be kind of
like power law divergent terms

01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:39.300
from the point of view
of the power counting

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.090
and we just don't have
to worry about those.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:44.910
And another way of
saying it is, it's not

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:48.330
that I'm removing absolutely
this whole integrand

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.620
in that region, right?

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.033
There could still be a
constant, for example,

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.200
that comes from that region.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.750
But if there's a constant
that comes from that region,

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:55.830
I don't care.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.470
What I care about removing is
any spare use IR singularities.

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:03.120
And for those I can make
a minimal subtraction,

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.380
which is just the first term.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:09.580
All right, so I want to
finish this discussion.

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:14.100
So if we do this,
we get an answer,

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:21.120
which I will try to write
on the board for you.

01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:28.443
So now I'm going to
distinguish all the epsilons

01:23:28.443 --> 01:23:30.360
and then we'll see what
this subtraction does.

01:23:41.457 --> 01:23:43.790
So if I was careful and I
distinguished all the epsilons

01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:49.530
in our original calculation,
it'd actually look like this.

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:56.660
And then the subtraction piece
gives an extra contribution

01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:04.270
and it's actually scaleless
in the n bar dot k here.

01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:10.190
So there's a scaleless
loop in this guy.

01:24:15.025 --> 01:24:20.870
So it actually vanishes if the
epsilon IR and the epsilon UV

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:22.860
are said to be equal.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:25.860
But what it does is it
converts the epsilon IRs that

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.890
are in the first expression
into epsilon UVs, which

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:30.450
is what we want.

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:31.950
So once you add up
these two things,

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:34.500
the epsilon IRs are
canceling and the epsilon IRs

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.960
that were coming in the
original formula, those

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.250
were coming about because
of this bad behavior

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:45.465
as n bar dot k goes into
the limit of n bar dot

01:24:45.465 --> 01:24:46.170
k going small.

01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:49.120
You can think about that roughly
as where the ultrasoft is.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.190
This is subtracting off that
behavior and the remainder

01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:56.324
then is coming from only
having divergences for a n bar

01:24:56.324 --> 01:25:00.480
dot k goes to infinity, which is
a proper collinear ultraviolet

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.815
divergence not from n
bar dot k going to 0.

01:25:03.815 --> 01:25:05.190
So once you put
the two together,

01:25:05.190 --> 01:25:07.680
the epsilon IRs cancel
and then we get exactly,

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.470
actually, the same expression
we had before but where

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:14.170
all those 1 over epsilons
are 1 over epsilon UVs.

01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:16.480
AUDIENCE: So the epsilon
has come from second term?

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.730
IAIN STEWART: From both terms.

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:21.748
So they both have epsilon IRs
but they cancel between them.

01:25:21.748 --> 01:25:22.290
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:23.160
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.260
And the remainder is
just epsilon UVs, so

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.810
all the epsilons that I wrote
my earlier formula would

01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:31.530
be now epsilon UVs once I take
into account the subtraction.

01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:34.080
So I could have just ignored
the subtraction and that's

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.340
often what people do.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.968
If they know that the zero
bins are giving a scaleless

01:25:37.968 --> 01:25:40.260
integral, they say, well,
let's ignore the subtraction,

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.932
we'll just say that
all the epsilons are UV

01:25:42.932 --> 01:25:45.168
and the zero bin makes them UV.

01:25:45.168 --> 01:25:46.710
But if we really
want to look and see

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:48.300
that things are
working properly,

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.690
we should take the subtraction
and calculate it and make sure

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:52.885
that that's true.

01:25:52.885 --> 01:25:54.510
But we could have
just taken the answer

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:57.100
that I wrote down earlier
and said those epsilons are

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.700
ultraviolet and let's
throw them in a counterterm

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.030
and calculate an
anomalous dimension.

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:04.793
So we'll proceed
that way next time,

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:06.210
but we now know
that actually they

01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:10.190
are ultraviolet divergences.

01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:13.610
So next time we'll take
the ultraviolet divergences

01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:15.942
and we'll define from
them a counterterm

01:26:15.942 --> 01:26:17.900
And we'll see how we get
an anomalous dimension

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:22.272
and what kind of logs we sum by
using that anomalous dimension.

01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:28.290
So the zero bin that's scaleless
in this particular example

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:29.400
is not always scaleless.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.938
So sometimes it
could give a nonce.

01:26:30.938 --> 01:26:32.730
Depends on the problem
you're dealing with.

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:37.650
So sometimes you can set things
up so that it's scaleless

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:39.893
and then you just
basically can ignore it.

01:26:39.893 --> 01:26:41.310
But that's not
always true, so you

01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:43.560
do have to think about whether
it's really going to be

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.090
true for what you're doing.

01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:47.250
If it is true, then
you can effectively

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:49.202
ignore it because it's
sort of just making

01:26:49.202 --> 01:26:51.660
the physics come out right,
making sure there's no overlap.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.868
But if your regulators set
up so that it's scaleless,

01:26:53.868 --> 01:26:56.290
you can just get around it.

01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:58.297
But in general, that
might not be true.

01:26:58.297 --> 01:26:59.880
If you had more
scales in the problem,

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.422
if you're doing some
calculation that

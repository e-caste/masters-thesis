00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.300
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: There's
some comments from the grader

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.960
who looked at your homeworks.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.880
So a couple of
points to remember

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.670
that they seem to be sort of
pervasive in several homeworks.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.360
One is that when
we do Snell's law,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.710
we have to apply the
rule-- the rule goes

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.070
like n sine theta equals
n prime sine theta prime.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.030
So remember that theta prime
is measured with respect

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.410
to the normal to the interface.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.320
So if this line
is the interface,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.170
I have, for example,
air and the glass here.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.470
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.010
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's good.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I think
my hand is confusing it.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.203
Maybe I should turn
off the autofocus.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.690
OK.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.090
So if this is the interface,
air and glass-- yes,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.800
I think my hand
was confusing the--

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.650
and the ray is incident,
for example, like this,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.510
then we apply Snell's law
with respect to the normal.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.370
So this is the angle theta,
not this one out here,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.680
not the other way around.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.360
And for this one, of course,
the same goes to the other side

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.350
of the-- whoops--

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.683
the other side of the interface.

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:48.530
The ray would go in
kind of like this.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.170
That would be theta prime.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.990
So that was one comment
from the homeworks.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.510
The other comment is about TIR.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.600
TIR actually happens for
all angle of incidence

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240
that are larger than
the critical angle.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.740
There seemed to
be some confusion

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.660
that somehow TIR happens
only at the critical angle.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.990
That is not true.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.250
In fact, strictly speaking,
at exactly the critical angle,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.900
TIR does not happen.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.810
What does happen is
this surface wave

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.690
that I mentioned in the notes.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.870
But for all angles
that are greater

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.090
than the critical angle,
this is when we have the TIR

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.650
condition for all those
angles, from critical

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.240
all the way to whatever it
is, 90 degrees, I suppose.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.490
The third comment-- and,
actually, this is the last one.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.680
The third comment is
about the speed of light.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.010
Some of you-- and,
actually, this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.250
is also in relation to
the streamer problem.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.390
There was some confusion
where the speed of light

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.240
is proportional to the
index of refraction

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.040
or inversely proportional.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.830
It is, in fact,
inversely proportional.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.310
The speed of light
goes like c over n,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.650
where n is the
index of refraction.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.840
And I don't know if there's
a mnemonic for this,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.790
but one way to
remember it is that c,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.550
the speed of light in
vacuum, is the highest

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.750
speed that anything can have.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
So, therefore, when
light enters a material,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.890
it can only go slower.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.780
So, then, the
index of refraction

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.230
tells you the amount by
which the speed of light

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.970
becomes slower in
a given dielectric.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.860
So these are some
things that are

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.270
useful to keep in mind
as we move forward.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.510
These two dots
don't mean anything.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.320
Just the ink from
the markers that

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.280
penetrated the piece of
paper, so please ignore it.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.060
So, last time, the topic was
composite optical elements.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.910
So we started with an example
of two lenses, two thin lenses

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.810
that were in tandem, and we
did the imaging condition,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.750
magnification, and all those
beautiful things with it.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.530
And then we also looked
at the thin lens--

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.650
I'm sorry-- at the thick
lens, where the thickness is

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.060
defined--

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.220
as you recall, it
is defined relative

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.200
to the paraxial approximation.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.310
If the distance between
the two curved surfaces

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.720
exceeds the cosine
theta, or whatever

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080
it is that the paraxial
approximation limits

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.600
for the negligible distance,
then we call the lens thick.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.915
And we saw that there's
some differences.

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:04.790
For example, the focal
length is a little bit

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.250
different in the
formula than it this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.680
for the case of the thin lens.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.750
But the primary
reason why we did it

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.060
is because I wanted
to define this concept

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.430
of principal planes.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.480
So the principal planes--

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.680
I'll move slowly so the
camera can follow me.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.330
So the principle planes
are basically the locations

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.360
where the rays bend at once.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.700
So in a thick optical element,
whether it is a thick lens

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.830
or it is a composite of
several lenses in tandem,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.770
as you can imagine, the rays
will bend several times.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.930
They may bend up,
downs, straight,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.190
and so on and so forth.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.740
But the idea is that if you take
a parallel ray from infinity,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.410
after however many times
it bends-- in this case,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.260
it bends twice, once
here and once here--

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.490
eventually it comes out at
the final propagation angle.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.290
So the principal
plane is the plane

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.200
that you obtain if you
extend the incoming ray,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000
you extend the outgoing ray,
and you find where they meet.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.480
That is the principal plane.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.110
In fact, in general, it
is a principal surface.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.440
If you really do the geometry
right, it is not a plane.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.870
It turns out to be
a curved surface,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.000
but within a paraxial
approximation, it is a plane.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.680
So that's why we define it with
sometimes as a principal plane

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.610
or as a principal surface.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.760
I kind of try to stick
to the term principal

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.610
plane in the notes.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.070
And then, relative to
the principal plane,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.760
as we did last time, you can
define the various quantities.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.620
The effective focal
length is simply

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.220
the distance from that principal
plane to the focal point.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.480
So, basically, as
far as the rays that

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.240
are coming from the
left are concerned,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.630
the principal plane is acting
like a thin lens, because the--

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.570
is acting like a thin
lens with a focal length

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.410
equal to the effective focal
length of the composite,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.230
because this is the ray
coming from infinity.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.780
And when it comes
out, it is as if I

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.040
had put a thin lens in
this particular location.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.650
The opposite is true
for images at infinity.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.160
So if you take a ray
from this point here,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.740
it actually goes to the
first principal plane,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.330
and then takes off to infinity.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.970
Now, of course,
again, this is what

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.010
I get when I take the incoming
ray and the outgoing ray,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.630
and then find where they meet.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.560
In general, this ray also
suffers multiple refractions.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.180
But if I take the first
one and the very last one,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.060
then I can have a thin lens
at the first principal plane.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.290
So this is the idea, and
we can see the reason

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.780
why they are
convenient when we do

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.520
the imaging condition for the
composite optical element.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.710
So we'll not do this again.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.960
Se Baek went through it
in great detail last time.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.800
But you can see that,
basically, if we

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.020
know the principal
planes, then we

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.570
don't have to worry about the
rest of the physical system

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.790
any more, because we
can discover things

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.890
like imaging condition,
magnification,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.520
and so on and so forth
simply by applying the rules

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.220
that we learned in the
case of the thin lens.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.580
For example, in this case,
in order to find the image,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.560
I take a ray that is horizontal.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.230
Therefore, it would
have come from infinity.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.500
I drag it all the way to
the second principal plane.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.580
Then I know it has to
go through the focus.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.419
And then I extend it further.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.890
When I take another one that
goes through the first focus,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.710
then I know that at the
first principal plane,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.240
this ray will have to
become horizontal, and again

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.080
take off towards infinity.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.960
So, therefore, this
ray goes like this.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.460
And then where they
meet is actually

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.967
the location of the image.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:55.800
So this is the idea.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.120
And then all the rest of the
formulas about the imaging

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.230
distances, the magnifications,
lateral, angular, so on

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.370
and so forth, they all fall
out from the similar triangles

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.590
in this diagram,
just in the same way

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.480
we did them for the
thin lens, except now we

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.850
have these sort of additional
space between the two

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.060
principal planes.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.790
So we have to be careful when
we deal with a ray that is

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.830
coming horizontal at the input.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.910
It has to bend at the
second principal plane.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.620
And when we think
the ray that goes

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.830
through the first focal point
and comes out horizontal,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.830
that one has to go through
the first principal plane.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:41.070
And the reason I'm
emphasizing this is because--

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.560
this is the generic case,
where the first principal is

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.180
to the left, the
second is to the right.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.120
But there is optical
systems where

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.620
they may actually be swapped.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.450
You may have the
second principal plane

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.270
to the left of the
first principal plane.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.240
There's no rule
that forbids that.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.690
It can happen.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.860
So that's fine.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.420
We still have to
apply the same rule,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.240
but we have to be careful
where we bend the ray.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.830
So one of the homeworks-- you
will see the homeworks that we

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.240
posted today and are due,
actually, next week--

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.910
you will see that this happens
in one of the optical systems

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.140
that we give you there.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.110
The second principal plane
is actually to the left.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.880
So I'll let you work
that out by yourselves,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.210
but keep that in mind.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.420
Always identify
which principal plane

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.400
you're using for any
given imaging condition.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.930
Any questions about all of this?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.210
Can someone say at
least good morning,

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.824
so I know if our sound
has been restored?

00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:51.947
AUDIENCE: Hello,
hello, can you hear us?

00:10:51.947 --> 00:10:53.530
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, either nobody

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.610
wants to say good morning
or there's no sound.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.152
AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:56.152 --> 00:10:58.010
No sound, I guess.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.240
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.922
I'll keep going, and, hopefully,
some time at some point

00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:02.630
we'll have sound.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.220
Or at some time
you'll wake up enough

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.650
to be willing to
say good morning.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.850
So, today, we'll
deal with a topic

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.480
called stops and apertures.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.850
And, basically,
we'll spend the rest

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.900
of the hour learning the
meaning of all of these terms.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.810
So there's quite a few of them--

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.075
aperture, pupil,
entrance, exit pupil.

00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:31.300
And then we field stop, window,
entrance and exit, and so on.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.690
So we'll spend some time
learning what these things are

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.470
and why they're useful
in an optical system.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.580
So starting with the first
one, the aperture stop,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.800
the aperture stop has
to do with the fact

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.780
that any optical instrument,
in practice, has a finite size.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.180
Therefore-- OK, let me back up.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.570
So the instrument
has a finite size.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.775
But a point source, as
we learned, it actually--

00:11:56.775 --> 00:11:58.760
at least an ideal source--

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:05.570
it emits kind of isotropically,
all the way 4 pi steradians

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.730
around the location
of the point source.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.410
So what this means, then, is
that the optical instrument

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.410
can only capture a fraction
of the light that this--

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.730
that any given point
sources is emitting.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.350
So the aperture
actually helps us

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.920
quantify how much is the light
that an optical instrument can

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.920
admit given the location
of a point source.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.420
So it is defined, actually, with
respect to a point source that

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.685
is located at the
optical axis, that is,

00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:39.320
at the center where
all of the optics

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.800
are rotationally
symmetric about.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.600
And there's two concepts here.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.660
One is the physical stop.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.820
So the physical stop
is-- you can think of it

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.130
as the rim of the optics, the
physical limit beyond which

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.560
the rays that are
coming from the source,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.380
they miss the optical
elements in the system.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.710
Those of you who have
cameras, you're also

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.580
familiar with
physical stops that,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.220
in relatively complicated
optical systems--

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.670
for example the lens that
goes with the camera--

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.700
inside there's a
little hole that

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.760
is very often adjustable
depending on the light level

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.510
and so on.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.270
This hole, nowadays
automatically,

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.150
in the old days
with photographers

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.280
having manual control,
you would actually

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.200
open and close that opening
to admit more or less light.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.720
This is called
the aperture stop.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.490
And we also are familiar
with something else,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.470
the pupil of our eyes.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.033
If you look at someone's
eyes, there's a little hole.

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:43.700
And if you look in a
bright environment,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.800
this hole is relatively small.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.510
If you move to a
dark environment,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.700
our eyes have a
mechanism that kind of

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.770
measures the ambient
light and opens up

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.540
or closes down the pupil.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:00.360
So this is the aperture stop for
the optical system of our eye.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.910
So the aperture stop, then,
is the physical element

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.540
that limits the acceptance
of the light rays.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.120
So, in this case,
the aperture stop,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.000
you can think of this sort
of black, thick line here,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.010
you can think of it as
a physical, for example

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.730
a metal plate with a
hole in the center.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.880
So that hole would be
the actual aperture stop

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.430
in this particular instrument.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.590
The numerical aperture is
a mathematical quantity.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:34.430
It is the angle subtended
from the point source

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.970
to the rim of the
physical aperture stop.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.120
And I was a little bit sloppy
when I called the angle.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.070
It is not the actual definition.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.210
It's the sine of
that angle multiplied

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.010
by the index of refraction.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.250
Now, we've already seen
Snell's law several times.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.340
You can guess immediately
the reason people define

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.450
the numerical aperture this
way is so that this quantity is

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:06.870
conserved when you go through
flat refractive interfaces.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.750
So it's very convenient because,
well, as we'll see later,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.430
the numerical aperture is
a very important quantity

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.750
in characterizing
an optical system.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.500
So, therefore, by sticking
the index of refraction

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.750
in this definition
here, we'll make sure

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.150
that the numerical
aperture is preserved

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:29.980
as rays go through various
elements in the system,

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.850
at least elements without power,
without optical power, that is,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.278
as they go through
flat interfaces.

00:15:37.278 --> 00:15:38.320
So that's the definition.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.480
Now, of course, in
many optical systems,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.800
the index where the
object lives is air.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.690
So, therefore, n is 1.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.970
And also, in this
class at least,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.310
we deal with the
paraxial approximation,

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.620
where the sine of the
angle is approximately

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.940
equal to the angle itself.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.340
So, therefore, indeed,
the numerical aperture

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.890
is approximately equal
to the angle itself.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.280
However, as you have
seen from the homework,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.890
if you already started it,
in many optical systems

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:13.090
the object lives in a
space of refractive index

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.260
different than 1.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.330
For example, in
immersion microscopy,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.280
we put a droplet of oil.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.680
We drop a droplet of oil
on top of the sample.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.080
Then we stick the
objective so that there

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.140
is oil in this space
here between the sample

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.980
and the objective.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.510
Well, in that case,
we really should

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.510
include the index of
refraction in the definition

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.450
of the optic-- of the
numerical aperture.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.360
So, of course, you
cannot speak yet,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.200
but I do want to ask
a question myself now.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.842
And if you can answer--

00:16:46.842 --> 00:16:48.550
well, those of you
who can answer easily.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.467
Those of you in Boston,
if you want to answer,

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.620
just please wave and we'll
figure out how to do it.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.320
But the question
I wanted to ask,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.720
what do you think the value
of the numerical aperture is?

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.750
Is it smaller than
1, bigger than 1?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.960
What is it?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.300
Do this if you think that
the numerical aperture is

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.560
bigger than 1.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.319
Do this if you think that the
numerical aperture is always

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.338
less than 1.

00:17:12.338 --> 00:17:13.130
What's the verdict?

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.010
Always less than 1.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.770
Anybody who thinks the opposite,
that the numerical aperture can

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:22.550
be bigger than 1?

00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:27.869
It's really strange.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.658
I feel like we're transported
to a different century now

00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:31.574
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:31.574 --> 00:17:33.750
Anyway.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.780
So, actually, in principle--
and, in fact, people do it--

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.420
I can construct an
optical instrument

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.300
with a relatively
large acceptance angle.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.520
For example, theta may be as
high as 75 degrees, 80 degrees.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.810
It is not uncommon in high-end
microscope objective lenses

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.130
to have a very high
acceptance angle.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.690
Of course, this would violate
the paraxial approximation,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.400
but that is no problem.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.310
The fact that the
instrument is not paraxial

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.470
actually does not make
it an invalid instrument,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.910
so it's fine.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.000
All it means is that our simple
theory here does not apply,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.520
and we have to be more
sophisticated in the analysis,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.440
but we can have a
large acceptance angle.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.710
For example-- so, in that
case, the sine of this angle

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.910
may be close to 1,
maybe 0.9 or 0.95.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.190
And, also, in addition, remember
that we can use immersion.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:31.190
So we can put the object in a
liquid of index of refraction--

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.190
for example, if it is
water, that would be 1.3.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.260
If it is one of
the immersion oils

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.870
that are used in microscopy,
what is the index, typically?

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.270
1.4, 1 point--

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.300
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.475
Just the same as glass?

00:18:45.475 --> 00:18:46.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:47.750
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:53.730
So even higher than for
immersion instruments, 1.54--

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.230
0.14.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.730
I'm sorry.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.170
1.514.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:02.767
And so, in that case, if I
do 1.514 times 0.9, of course

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.100
it will be bigger than 1, right?

00:19:11.855 --> 00:19:13.980
I don't know what it is,
but it would be definitely

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.180
bigger than 1.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.820
So, actually, I can have
a numerical aperture

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.350
that is bigger than 1.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.840
That is kind of a useful
point to remember.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.990
Related to the-- so
the numerical aperture

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.970
is used very commonly
in microscopy

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.950
when we characterize
objective lenses.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.240
Typically, we characterize them
by their numerical aperture.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.750
In photography,
especially, people

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.930
prefer to use an alternate
quantity known as the f number.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.840
So the f number is
kind of the inverse

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.990
of the numerical aperture
times a factor of 1/2,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.200
which always confuses
the hell out of me.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.630
But, anyway, the f number,
it is written like this.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.020
And people replace the hash
symbol with the actual number.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.970
For example, if you look
at the lens of a camera,

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.650
it may something like f/8.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.680
This means that the f number
of this camera lens is 8.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.730
So the rule of thumb is
where does your money go?

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.600
When you pay money for a
very good quality microscope

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.510
objective, one of those
that cost $10,000 or so,

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.910
typically you pay--

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.190
in a microscope
objective, you pay

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.010
for a large numerical aperture.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.500
When you walk into
a store and you

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.190
buy a high-end, expensive
camera lens, one of those Nikon

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.390
or a Zeiss, really expensive
multi-element lenses

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.020
that look about as
big as my computer

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.580
here, what you pay there is
for a really low f number.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.060
So, generally, large
numerical aperture is good.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.740
Or, equivalently,
low f number is good,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.390
provided you can
afford it, of course.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.050
So, at the moment, the
way we defined it so far,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.440
the numerical aperture, it
seems to be related only

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.380
to the energy acceptance
of the optical system, that

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.970
is, how much--

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.410
how many watts of optical power
the optical system admits.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.330
So this is of course
important, but you

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.310
might wonder why am I
making such a big deal,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.460
and why people pay so
much money for high NA.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.600
Well, again, the energy
acceptance, as you can imagine,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.280
is incredibly
important because it

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.360
will determine how many useful
photons from the object you

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.890
admit into your system
for imaging purposes.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.830
But, as we will learn later,
the numerical aperture

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.820
also defines the resolution
of an optical system.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.780
And, right now, you probably
know from everyday life

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.060
what resolution means.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.300
People talk about the
resolution in your camera,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.280
in your television,
and so on and so forth.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.650
We will do a precise
definition of resolution

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.320
later, in about
a month from now.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.510
We'll define it very
precisely, and we'll

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.040
see why and how it is related
to this numerical aperture

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.000
quantity.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.900
But, again, the rule is that the
largest the numerical aperture,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.940
or, equivalently, the
smaller the f number,

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.290
the better the resolution
of an optical system.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.370
So we will see this
come up again and again.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:34.860
So that's the basic
definition that we use.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.350
Now, related to this
concept of aperture stop

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.690
and numeric aperture,
there is two sort

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.360
of derivative
definitions, and these

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.410
are called the pupils, the
entrance and exit pupils.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.540
So in order to define
those, I kind of

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.350
need a multi-element
optical system,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.800
so I sort of concocted
one over there.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.550
I just made it up.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.310
This is nothing in particular.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.010
I just stuck some
lenses in tandem,

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.430
And i put the aperture stop
somewhere in the middle.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.710
So think of this again as
a physical element, a hole

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.360
that I put in there.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.560
So the reason we need these
additional definitions

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.450
of the pupils is that if
the aperture stop is varied

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.690
inside an optical instrument,
as it happens, for example,

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.100
in your camera
lens-- if you look

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.993
at your photographic camera
that you have at home,

00:23:25.993 --> 00:23:27.660
you will see that the
aperture is varied

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.750
inside a relatively
large lens barrel

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.170
if you have a
sophisticated camera.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.510
The aperture is a
physical element.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.860
It is a hole, right?

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.250
So if you look at your
lens from the one side

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.890
that looks towards the object,
or from the opposite side that

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.500
looks towards the CCD,
you will see the aperture,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.730
but you will not see
the aperture itself,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.050
you will see the image
of that aperture stop

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.830
through the elements that
precede or succeed it.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:06.710
So because of that, people
have defined this concept

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.890
of the entrance and exit pupil.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.690
So the entrance
pupil is what you

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.090
get if you take
this aperture stop

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.210
and now you treat it as an
object in an imaging system,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:22.010
and you image it through the
preceding optical elements.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.850
Now, here, I've committed
a mortal violation.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.450
I imaged from right to left.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.380
We said last time
that every time we'll

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.600
write down an optical
system, the light

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.478
is assumed to go onwards
from left to right.

00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:41.770
So, here, this is an exception.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.660
When we deal with
aperture stops,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.870
we actually image
from right to left,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.710
because we really need to
look at this as the object,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.000
and image it through the optical
elements that precede it.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.705
So if we do that, then we
get the entrance pupil.

00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:01.940
So, in this case, it would
look something like this.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.980
So this is now not a
physical component any more.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.980
It is the image of the
physical component that

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.560
was inside the
system, and we imaged

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.930
through the elements
that preceded it

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.360
in that optical system.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.630
Similarly, we can
define the exit pupil

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.340
if we image the
physical aperture

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.730
stop through the
elements that succeed it.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.038
So the two definitions
are kind of conjugate.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:37.310
Now, with respect
to this entrance,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.820
exit pupils and aperture
stops-- this is a mouthful--

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.530
you can define two
significant rays that

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.200
come up in the design of
optical systems all the time,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.030
and we'll see why.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:54.510
The first one is
called the chief ray,

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.430
and the chief ray is
defined as the ray that

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.130
goes through the center
of the aperture stop,

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.480
the physical aperture stop.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.970
So that's one.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.200
The other is called
the marginal ray,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.770
and it is the ray that
goes through the rim

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.840
of the physical
aperture stop, that is,

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.950
the ray that just
clears the aperture.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.650
If you take the
next ray, that would

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.520
propagate at a slightly higher
angle with respect to this one.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.560
This ray would actually
hit the physical block

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.830
that is located at the
aperture plane and would miss.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:40.830
So this last ray just
before the aperture stop

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.750
blocks the rest
of the light, this

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.443
is called the marginal ray.

00:26:45.443 --> 00:26:47.360
So you can already see
the importance of this,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.660
because the marginal ray
kind of defines again

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.920
the angle of acceptance
of the optical system.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.630
Except, this time,
notice that I've

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.620
done this for an
off-axis object point.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.060
Recall that a numerical
aperture, the way I

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.910
defined it before, it was
still the angle of acceptance

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.590
but for an on-axis object point.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.150
Here, the marginal
and the chief rays,

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:15.410
I can define them for any
point I like, any point I

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.930
like that is in
the object space.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.830
And this step, let me sort of--

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.530
OK, I already decided
that these rays help us

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.650
define the angle of acceptance.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.200
Now, before I show
the next slide,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:42.320
and since these two rays,
these two important rays,

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.340
where do you think they might
go with respect to the entrance

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.140
and exit pupils?

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.310
By definition, they go
through the center and edge

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.170
of the aperture
stop, respectively,

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.020
the chief and marginal ray.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.510
So, therefore, with respect to
the entrance and exit pupils,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.390
where do you think
these rays would pass?

00:28:22.495 --> 00:28:23.870
So the answer is
that they should

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.030
pass through the
center and an edge,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.360
respectively, as well,
because the entrance and exit

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.570
pupils are images of
the aperture stop.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.220
So, for example,
if the chief ray

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.100
goes through the center
of the aperture stop,

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.760
then it should also go through
the center of the entrance

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.520
and exit pupils
because these are

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.270
images of the aperture
stop through the preceding

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.990
and succeeding elements.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.430
And, similarly, the
marginal ray hits

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.230
the rim of the aperture stop.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:58.520
Therefore, it should also
hit the rim of the entrance

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.227
and exit pupils, respectively.

00:29:01.227 --> 00:29:02.810
Now, for the marginal
ray, there could

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.380
be magnifications involved.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.610
So, for example, the distance
from the optical axis

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:12.680
to the rim, it may be different
in the aperture stop plane

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.340
than it is, for example, in
the entrance pupil plane.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.200
And that is because,
in this case,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.710
the optical system has
magnified the aperture stop.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.330
So the entrance
pupil in this case

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.360
is bigger than the
physical stop itself.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.340
So, therefore, the
marginal ray, it

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.080
hits the optical axis
at a different location.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.080
And, also, as you can
see, there's an inversion.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.777
It hits at the bottom
at the aperture stop,

00:29:35.777 --> 00:29:37.860
and then it hits at the
top of the entrance pupil.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.500
This is fine, but what I--

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.260
because of the way
optical systems behave.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.820
They can produce inversions
and magnifications,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.520
and as we have seen.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.410
But what I want to
emphasize is that they

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.560
go through the rim
because of that property

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.750
that the aperture is imaged at
the entrance and exit pupils,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.990
respectively.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.910
And, of course, the
two rays will also

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:08.360
meet again at the corresponding
image point at the image plane.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:14.240
Because the two rays emanated
from the object, if the imaging

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.120
system is good, that is, if
it does form an image properly

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.790
and we don't have some
kind of a weird defocus

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.920
or some other kind
of inconvenience,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.430
then the two rays should better
meet again at the image point,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:31.820
because the entire spherical
ray bundle that emanated here,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.710
that diverged
here, it would also

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.027
converge by the time
it arrives here.

00:30:36.027 --> 00:30:37.610
So, therefore, these
two rays are just

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.890
members of this
spherical ray bundle,

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.110
so they will meet again
at the object point.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:55.275
So any questions?

00:30:55.275 --> 00:30:56.400
I know this is frustrating.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.020
Even if you have a question,
you cannot speak your mind.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.570
But any questions?

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.982
Can you just wave at least
so I know to save time later

00:31:03.982 --> 00:31:04.940
to answer the question?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.801
AUDIENCE: So how do you define
the distance between the--

00:31:22.801 --> 00:31:23.843
I guess he can't hear me.

00:31:23.843 --> 00:31:24.810
Ah, right.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:25.560
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Let me move on

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.090
with a slightly
different concept,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.280
and then we'll come back
to this topic again.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.340
So the next topic
is a different kind

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.260
of stop called the field stop.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.140
So remember the
definition of chief ray.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.270
We said that the chief
ray is a ray that

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:45.332
goes through the
center of the pupil.

00:31:45.332 --> 00:31:49.460
I mean the entrance pupil,
the aperture stop, and so on.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.710
So here is a chief ray
from a tall object,

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.070
and here is a chief ray
from a short object.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.780
| of the chief
rays, they will go

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.583
through the center of the
aperture stop by definition.

00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.750
And, of course, they will
also go through the center

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.840
of the entrance pupil.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.518
The entrance pupil used to
be here, if you remember.

00:32:10.518 --> 00:32:12.060
I'm not drawing it
any more because I

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.560
don't want to
clutter this diagram,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.070
but it used to be here.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.460
So the two rays, they
meet at this point

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.690
because they're the
images of the aperture.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.150
However, this ray
will go off axis

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.370
at other points in
the optical system,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.430
and there will be some
point in the optical system

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.600
where one of these
rays may get cut.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.800
This element in
the optical system

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.250
that limits the chief rays,
that element is called the field

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.020
stop.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.160
And the physical significance
of the field stop

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.990
is actually very important
and even more intuitive

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.560
than the aperture stop.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.090
The field stop is what
defines the field of view.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.710
And now the field of view
has a formal definition.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.530
It is this angle
here that I drew.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.590
But even in colloquial language,
when we say the field of view,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.330
we know exactly what we mean.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.880
In an image, the field
of view is basically

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.490
the size that can be visible.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.180
And outside the field of
view, the image is not formed.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.600
So an example is if I look
at you-- well, actually,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.800
this is great because I look
at you through a camera,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.270
and the way the camera
is pointed right now,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:29.150
I can only see the central row
of desks out in Cambridge but I

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.403
cannot see those of you
who are seated on the left

00:33:31.403 --> 00:33:32.070
or on the right.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.160
So you might be picking
your nose, for example,

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.200
and I would not
be able to see it.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.250
And that's because you are
outside my field of view.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.640
And thank you for the control,
for turning the camera.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.570
Now what is happening, my
field of view is shifting.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:52.390
So the field stop in
this case is actually

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.985
the dye, the electronic
dye that captures

00:33:55.985 --> 00:33:58.890
the image electronically
on your side,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.490
then transmits it to
us here in Singapore.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.760
This is the physical field stop
that limits how many of you

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.030
I can see at any given instance.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.770
So the field stop is second
to the numerical aperture

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.880
and the aperture stop,
is another very important

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.690
quantity.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.670
It tells us how big is the size
of an object that we can see.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.250
So if you look, for
example, at a telescope--

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.770
if you look at the night
sky through a telescope,

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:29.739
the field of view is basically
how many stars can fit,

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:34.420
what portion of the sky you
can fit within your image

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.790
when you look through
the telescope.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.150
When you look through a
microscope, similarly, the size

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.150
of the specimen that you can
observe in the microscope,

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.010
that would be the field of view.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:48.460
Now, intuitively, we would like
to define the field of view

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.909
in physical size, in meters,
or millimeters, or microns,

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.800
or whatever the case might be.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.330
For reasons that will become
apparent a little bit later,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.240
we prefer to define
the field of view

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.560
as an angle actually, the angle
subtended towards the object.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.502
And you can guess--

00:35:03.502 --> 00:35:04.960
I don't even have
to make you wait.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.620
You can guess why we define
angle instead of physical size.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.720
That is because, very
often, optical systems

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.260
have variable magnification.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.740
So with the same optical
system might move a lens,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.550
and then the object would
move, but the field of view

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.200
might not change.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.620
So if I define it as a
size and then move it here,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.700
then the size would be bigger,
whereas the angle generally

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.640
is preserved.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.460
So that's why we define
the field of view

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.140
as an angle in radians
or degrees instead

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.170
of physical distances.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.420
AUDIENCE: Hello, hello, hello.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.120
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So that is
the meaning of the field stop.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.780
And, similarly, through the
entrance and exit pupils

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.120
that we saw for
the aperture stop,

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.990
we can define equivalent
quantities for the field stop,

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.540
but we'll call the windows.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.770
So if we image the field stop
through the preceding elements,

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.620
we get what is called
the entrance window.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.950
If we image it through
the succeeding elements,

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.770
we'll get what is
called the exit window.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.820
And, generally, in an optical
system, these windows,

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:19.110
they should coincide with
your object and image planes

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.420
respectively.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.790
So the entrance window should
coincide with the object plane.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.792
The exit window should
coincide with the image plane.

00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:30.500
If that's not the
case, there's something

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.520
wrong with the optical system.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.060
It can happen.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.740
It is not impossible,
but there's something

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.990
wrong with the optical system.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.240
So now that we did that, let's
put all these definitions

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.640
together.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.250
There's a lot of
confusion in the diagram,

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.840
but it shows everything.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.880
It shows the chief
and marginal rays.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.080
It shows the two physical
stops, the aperture stop

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.670
and the field stop.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.340
And then it shows their
images with respect

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.800
to the preceding and
succeeding elements,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.660
that are called the entrance
and exit pupil and windows,

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.890
respectively.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.880
I realize this is a bunch of
terms that I threw at once.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.100
So treat this as an
information session,

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.040
then go back and make sure you
read them again from the notes

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.190
and from the book so you make
sure they sort of solidify

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.380
in your mind.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.870
But this diagram,
actually, I spent

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.180
a lot of time making this
diagram because I actually

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.950
drew it by hand.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.080
Instead of using an
optical software,

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.330
I did it by hand, so it
took me a lot of time

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.200
to make it accurate.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.330
But, to the best that I can--

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.215
I tried, it's pretty accurate,
except for this lens here.

00:37:41.215 --> 00:37:42.590
This lens doesn't
look very good.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.840
It's a negative lens.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.450
It should have sort of diverged
this ray bundle even more.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.972
If I had done this
properly, this

00:37:48.972 --> 00:37:50.930
would then become monstrous,
so I didn't do it.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.220
But, anyway.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.400
But you can see how it works.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.380
Here's the chief ray.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.160
Let's trace it
through the system.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.440
So here's the chief ray.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.620
It goes through the center
of the entrance pupil.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.360
Then it goes through the
edge of the field stops.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.560
That means that I chose a chief
ray that propagates at an angle

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.030
equal to what?

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.130
Equal to the field
of view, right?

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.320
Because this is the last chief
ray admitted through a system.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.110
If I put a chief ray at a bigger
angle, that is a taller object,

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:27.400
it would miss the field stop.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.260
Then the same chief ray goes on.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.350
It goes through a center
of the aperture stop

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:36.220
again, then again through
the center of the exit pupil,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.000
and finally hits the edge
of the exit window, which

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.055
is also the tip of the image.

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:44.930
That's the chief ray.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.710
Now let's go through
the marginal ray.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:53.060
The marginal ray will hit the
rim of the entrance pupil,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.180
then will hit the rim
of the field stop again.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.910
Why?

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.500
I'll give you 30 seconds
to think about it.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.150
Why does the marginal ray
hit the rim of the field stop

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.650
again?

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.560
My computer has
actually a timer,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.326
so I can count the 30
seconds very precisely.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:28.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.500
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh, there is audio,

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.010
so you can even
speak your mind now.

00:39:33.968 --> 00:39:35.010
Thanks, by the way, for--

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.467
thanks, control, for fixing it.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:40.800
Anybody?

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.580
Why does the marginal ray
also go through the rim,

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.740
the edge of the field stop?

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.200
AUDIENCE: Because
the entrance window

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.850
is an image of the field stop?

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.450
Or it's the other way around.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.700
So the marginal ray is--

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.367
I mean, it's the edge
of window, so it's

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.360
going to be on the edge
of the field stop also.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.110
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's exactly right.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.400
These two planes are
images of each other.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.980
So since the marginal ray
meets the chief ray here,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.910
then it should also meet
the chief ray here again.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.950
Another way to put it
is that this is actually

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:24.400
an intermediate image plane for
this particular optical system.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400
So then the-- in
other words, you

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.070
would see an image of
the object itself here

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.890
if you were to stick your eye.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.540
Then the imaginary
ray will go again.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.780
Now it goes again through
the edge of the aperture stop

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.980
again.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.870
And that is, of
course, because it

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.150
went through the
edge of the pupil,

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.410
and since the pupil
and the aperture stop

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:47.010
are images of each other, then
it has to go through the edge

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.440
again.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.690
Now it will become repetitive.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:54.320
It will hit again the rim of the
exit pupil for the same reason.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.820
And then, finally, it would
hit the edge of the exit window

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.840
because the exit window is
an image of the field stop.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.980
So these multiple
imaging requirements,

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.680
they sort of make this
all makes sense, right?

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.210
But this is how they work.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.100
The marginal ray, as
the name suggests,

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.530
hits the rims of everything--
the aperture stops, the pupils,

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.210
the windows, and all that.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.680
The chief ray, it goes
through the center

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.150
of the pupils, entrance and
exit, and the aperture stop,

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.020
and hits the edges, the
rims of the field stop

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.170
and the associated
entrance and exit windows.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.650
And, finally, now that we
have everything together, here

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.210
is again the definition
of the field of view.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:49.050
It is angle between the
last two chief rays admitted

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.440
by the system, last
two meaning that it

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.080
is the last two that the
field stop would admit.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.500
And the numerical
aperture is the angle

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:08.180
between the two marginal rays
that depart from the center,

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.820
from the center of
the window, that is,

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.530
from the optical axis itself.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:20.170
We do not define the numerical
aperture from off-axis points.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:26.306
The reason is that, in poorly
designed optical systems--

00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:29.440
first of all, let me say,
in an ideal optical system,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.540
the numerical aperture should be
equal no matter where you are.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.670
Within the field of view,
the numerical aperture

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.580
should be the same.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.700
In practice, that is
very difficult to do,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.080
and if you do a particularly
poor job as a designer,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.750
the numerical aperture
can decrease drastically

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.400
when you go off axis here.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.320
In fact, in the next
example that I will show,

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.670
this will happen.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.760
The numerical aperture
becomes drastically smaller

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.215
as you go off axis.

00:43:02.215 --> 00:43:04.440
That is called vignetting.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.020
It's one of those French words
that have crept in optics

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.610
and is difficult to pronounce.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.150
You will see it
written in a second.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.640
I will just write it
down here, vignetting.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.300
It is very annoying, because
if you have vignetting

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.150
in an optical system, then
the edges of the image,

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.350
they appear darker.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.500
Remember, the numerical
aperture is the amount of light

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.600
that the optical system admits.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.020
Well, if I admit more
light in the center,

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.450
I have a larger numerical
aperture in the center.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:38.100
A numerical aperture
decreases as I go off axis,

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.950
it means that the edges of
the image will be darker.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.540
It will be dimmer.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.670
And that is, of course,
very undesirable.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.070
And, generally, when we design
microscopes, telescopes,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:52.580
and such, we try to make sure
that this will not happen.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.710
But, anyway, because
this could happen,

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:58.290
that's why the numerical
aperture is defined

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.200
at the center, on
axis, so that it

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.120
has an unambiguous definition.

00:44:06.945 --> 00:44:08.570
So having said all
that, let's look now

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.960
at an example that
will actually reveal

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.360
this vignetting phenomenon,
in addition to other things.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.670
So this example is
relatively simple.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.470
It is just a single thin lens.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.710
And then, in front
of the thin lens,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:27.970
we've put an aperture stop.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.470
You can think of
it-- actually, this

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:33.700
is a very simplified model
of the eye, of the human eye.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.710
We have a lens in front of it.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.110
In the human eye, we
call it the pupil, right?

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.270
Of course, in the
human eye, in actuality

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:42.130
you also have an
additional lens in front

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.900
of the pupil called the cornea.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.400
But, anyway, that's why this
is perhaps not an ideal model.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.700
But, anyway, that's the
example that I chose to do.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.340
And, in addition, it
has a field stop which

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.680
is located at the image plane.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.430
Now, generally, if you see
a stop at the image plane,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.640
this is a good candidate to
be the field stop, right.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:09.183
Because, clearly, if I image
anything outside this opening--

00:45:09.183 --> 00:45:10.850
this is what aperture
means, by the way.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.860
Literally, aperture
means opening.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.130
So if I image anything
outside this opening,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.460
then it will hit the block, and
therefore it will not be image.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.290
So, therefore, this is very
clearly the field stop.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.460
Physically, the field
stop is, for example,

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.470
as I mentioned
earlier, it is the size

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.970
of the chip that registers
the digital image, right?

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:35.150
It's a very simple
instance of a field stop.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.390
In old-fashioned
cameras that use film,

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.290
then the field stop would be,
in that case, the film itself.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.900
Wherever the film is
chemically active,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.760
this is where you
record the image.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.305
Outside, it's just lost.

00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:51.180
Whatever is imaged
outside that area is lost.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.150
So, in this case, it is pretty
clear who is the aperture

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.630
and who is the field stop.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.170
So you can see very clearly
that if you take an object

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:08.770
point on the axis, then
the physical aperture here

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:11.170
will block the
angle of acceptance

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:13.540
from this particular point.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.940
And, therefore, this
is the aperture stop.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.280
And, also, because there
is no elements to the left,

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.920
this is also the entrance pupil.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.460
If there is no element to image
it through, the aperture stop

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.720
will also be, simultaneously,
the entrance pupil.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.360
What this means is that if you
look at the imaging instrument,

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.540
you will actually see the
pupil itself before you ever

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.440
see anything else.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.860
So that's why the two
things are actually

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.270
coincident in this case.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.210
What about the exit pupil?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.180
Well, the exit pupil is
what I will see on this side

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:52.810
if I image this element through
the succeeding elements.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.570
So the succeeding element
is this lens here.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.960
So what will I see if I
image this through the lens?

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.597
Well, this element now--
forget about the actual object

00:47:02.597 --> 00:47:03.180
of the system.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.690
When we question-- when we ask
what are the entrance and exit

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.390
pupils, this is now our object.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.730
We're trying to see where
this would be imaged

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.340
through the optical system.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.160
And we notice is that this
is between the focal point

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.092
and the lens.

00:47:18.092 --> 00:47:19.050
Here's the focal point.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.010
Here's the lens.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.060
This is in between.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.240
Therefore, this will
form a virtual image.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.500
So the exit pupil would
be somewhere out here.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.710
It would be actually to
the left of the lens.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.710
That is not surprising.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.460
All it means is that
if I go here and then

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.260
look at the optical instrument
this way, what I will see,

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.830
I will see a virtual
image of the pupil,

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.480
very similar to
the virtual images

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.870
that you saw last time
in the demo in the class

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:54.030
when Pepe brought the
magnifier objective.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.790
So that's the exit
pupil over here.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:59.940
And what about the
marginal and chief rays?

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.420
Well, here is the--

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.500
here they are.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.610
Here's the marginal ray.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.020
Here's the chief ray.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.457
The chief ray, by
definition, has

00:48:09.457 --> 00:48:11.540
to go out through the
center of the aperture stop.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.570
So that is indeed.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.970
The marginal ray hits the rim.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.320
And what about
the field of view?

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.430
Well, the field of view will
be defined by the pupil--

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.030
I'm sorry.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.940
It would be defined
by the field stop.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.730
Now, notice that the field
stop is also the exit window

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.400
because there is no optical
elements to its right.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.740
So, therefore, that
is the exit window.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.100
The entrance window is
at the object plane,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.750
since this is the
object plane and this

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.320
is the image plane that
satisfy an imaging condition.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.620
That is, if you image the field
stop through the preceding

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.330
optical elements,
you'll arrive here.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.420
So that's the entrance window.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.670
And, of course,
the field of view

00:48:54.670 --> 00:49:00.360
is defined by the two chief rays
that just clear the field stop,

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.750
so here they are.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.150
And the angle between the
two is the field of view.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.030
By the way, there is one
ambiguity in the literature.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.690
Some people define the field
of view as the full angle.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.420
Some people define
it as the half angle.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.290
It's a matter of taste,
how you want to define it.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.270
But just make sure you tell
people what you really mean,

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.580
if you really mean
the full thing or not.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:27.850
And here they're all together,
all these quantities.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:32.220
And-- yes?

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.620
Oh, let me ask--
yes, never mind.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.880
And, in this case, I
actually worked out the math.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.130
I will not go through it here.

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:46.010
I will let you do
it by yourselves.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.760
If I put some
symbols, for example

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:54.630
if I call the size of the
aperture stop, I call it a.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.230
The size of the field
stop, I call it w prime.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.490
Then I have distance z between
the aperture stop and the lens,

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.950
distance s prime between
the lens and the field stop.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:13.140
And then this calculation
shows you where--

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.160
how you find the other
elements of the system.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.400
For example, when it comes
to the entrance pupil,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.450
what should you to do?

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.250
Well, for the entrance
pupil, we have

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.780
to consider this optical system.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.730
If that's our aperture stop,
then I have distance z.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.560
Then I have the lens.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.780
And then-- well, I'm sorry.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.240
The entrance pupil is the--

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.875
I should have said
the exit pupil.

00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:41.000
So where is the exit pupil?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.550
Well I have to image
this aperture stop

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.610
through the system.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:45.980
So how do I image it?

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.720
Well, let's say that the exit
pupil is at some distance z

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.430
prime to the right of the lens.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.150
Well, how do we find z prime?

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:01.340
We apply the imaging condition,
1 over z plus 1 over z prime

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.030
equals 1 over f.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.490
We can solve that.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.810
1 over z prime equals 1
over f minus 1 over z.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:14.200
This is also known as z
minus f over f times z.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.160
Or z prime equals f
times z over z minus f.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.200
Now, I said that
the aperture stop

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.460
is between the focal
point and the lens.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:35.980
That means that z is
less than f in this case.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.520
Therefore, this quantity--
since z is less than f,

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.470
this quantity turned
out to be negative.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:44.860
If it is negative, it
means that my assumption

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:50.810
before that the exit pupil is
to the right was incorrect.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:52.400
My assumption would
have been correct

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.790
if z prime had turned out
to be a positive quantity.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.160
Since this is turning
out to be negative here,

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.980
it means that the actual
exit pupil is to the right.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.480
I'm sorry.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.690
It is to the left, opposite
from my assumption.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:10.245
So, therefore, the exit pupil
is over here, as I already said,

00:52:10.245 --> 00:52:13.490
or as I already said before.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.480
And, basically,
this result, these

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.740
are all the quantities here.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.510
You can see the marginal
ray from the field edge,

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.032
the marginal ray from
on axis, the chief ray,

00:52:25.032 --> 00:52:25.990
and so on and so forth.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:28.660
And the last comment
here, I did not really

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.370
prove it mathematically.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.630
You can do it if you like.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.330
It's a bit of a more
involved calculation.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.310
But even visually
here, you can see

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:40.660
that the angle between
marginal rays on axis

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.900
is, even in my
handwritten diagram here,

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.740
it is visibly larger than
the angle between the two

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.818
marginal rays off axis.

00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:51.610
This means that this
particular system here

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.790
is subject to vignetting
that I mentioned earlier.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.980
That's the term
here, vignetting,

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:01.600
which means it is not a very
well-designed optical system.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.650
In sophisticated
optical systems,

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:07.150
there's rules that we follow
in order to avoid vignetting.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:11.170
When I describe the
microscope next week--

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:12.430
I mean, not next week.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.860
Next Wednesday, in
2 days from today,

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.220
I will show you how
microscopes are designed

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:22.030
in order to avoid vignetting.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.700
And I see that I've already
gone 2 minutes over time.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.140
So let me conclude,
unless there's

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.780
any questions that someone will
ask, now that we have sound.

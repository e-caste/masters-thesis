00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:21.980
RODRIC RABBAH: OK, great.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.800
So a lot of effort into
making this course, and we

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.742
hope you've had fun.

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:31.120
It's been a lot of support
from Sony, IBM, Toshiba.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.880
A lot of on demand help
from people at IBM and Sony,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.317
trying to debug problems,
even up to the last minute.

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:39.650
So we're very thankful for that.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.820
And we hope in return that
you really enjoyed the course,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.870
and it was really fun.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
So looking forward to
the course evaluations.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.740
So just want to tell
you a little bit

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.260
about some opportunities ahead.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.450
I've passed out these brochures
for the cell broadband engine

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.080
challenge, Beyond Gaming.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.040
And this is a IBM sponsored
event, where you really

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.150
can compete in two different
challenges, and in one of them

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.650
you can win really
seriously cool t-shirts.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.240
That's actually lifted
directly from the online link.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.090
So the competition starts
February 5 at midnight.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.310
And you have to pass an online
quiz, of which I expect all

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.770
of you should be able to pass.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.220
And hopefully, you will
compete and at least get

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.300
a seriously cool t-shirt.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.680
The second challenge, which is
potentially more interesting,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.200
just because there's
a $10K grand prize--

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.500
there's also a $7K second
prize, and some serious money

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740
for at least three
or four prizes.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.580
You can look at information
in the brochures.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.080
According to the
information, you'll

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.326
find it requires some serious
coding skills on your part.

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:48.700
But I certainly
expect all of you

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.800
to be able to be well
primed at this point,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.700
especially since you've
learned about cell hands on,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.550
and you've discovered all
the pitfalls on your own.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.610
It would make for a very good
competition on your part.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.960
There are different categories.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.100
Sorry, it's three
categories, not four.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.374
Application solutions-- so some
of things, some of the people

00:02:09.374 --> 00:02:11.540
have done more application
oriented thing could fit,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.800
or you can sort of take
what you've learned,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.720
apply it to financial
services if you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.750
have interest in
that, medical imaging,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.230
electronic design, automation,
things of that sort.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.114
Operating systems--
I'm not sure if that's

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:26.030
particularly relevant
to a lot of people here.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.770
I'm not sure if that's
in their interest area,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.710
but programmability.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.990
So certainly the
streaming framework

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.919
that one of the software
radio projects tried to do

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.460
would fit onto that,
some of the work

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460
that the Ray Tracer
team did, in terms

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.760
of coming up with their
own interface for graphics

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610
could certainly fit.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.420
So I urge you to consider
competing in these.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.250
There's probably a lot of fame
and fortune to be had here.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.170
So we had our own competition.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.440
And what you're going to get are
some seriously cool trophies,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.650
since we don't have t-shirts.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.060
So Mary was very--
could have had t-shirts.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.880
I didn't want to compete
with IBM directly.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.320
So for the winning team, you
will get this seriously awesome

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.940
looking trophy, which has a
little imprint on the front

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.890
that says first place, 6.189.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.480
And you're also going to
get a $150 gift certificate,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.410
I think we announced this at
the beginning it of the course.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.310
I'm also working
with people at IBM

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.650
on arranging a one
day trip to IBM T.J.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.260
Watson Research Center,
for the winning team

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.800
to present their winning
project, do a demo,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.750
and then meet with people
at IBM who are doing really

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.750
cool, interesting research.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.120
And it should be a fun day.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.746
And certain people
at IBM have been

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:50.495
very excited about
hearing what's going on

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.750
in this project, in this class.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.430
And so it'll be a
good, fun opportunity,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.400
I think, all around.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.170
OK, so I'm going to work my
way up to the first prize.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.800
I think in terms of the
complexity of the project

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.990
handled, certainly
Speech Synthesis probably

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.350
took on the most
complex-- certainly

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.380
in terms of the
software that they used,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.622
and then maybe that
bogged them down a little.

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:15.080
So there's probably
something to be

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.459
said in terms of starting
from scratch versus taking

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.380
complex infrastructure
and re-engineering it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.390
for parallelism.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.220
I think you've
discovered firsthand

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.870
how hard that really is.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.030
And this is a big problem
for parallel computing.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.800
There's a lot of legacy
software out there

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.425
that eventually might
have to be ported

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:32.010
to parallel architectures.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.990
How do you do it?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.510
You pointed out, code
is not well documented.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.620
Tools are lacking.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.560
So what do you do?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.900
So you've stumbled on a really
seriously important problem

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.830
facing a lot of people
in the industry.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.290
The most synchronization issues.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.370
We believe the guys who are
doing the Battery Simulations

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.576
and modeling sort of
the chemical reactions

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:55.700
certainly ran into a lot
of synchronization issues,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.240
just because of the dependent
nature of the computation.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.040
Next up on the list would be for
the most parallel programming

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.980
challenges.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.720
So not only did they run into
issues with synchronization,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.670
but certainly discovered
problems with races.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.961
And I think they're the only
team who have successfully

00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:15.860
hung their PlayStation
3 several times,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.050
and required a reboot
quite a few times.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.550
OK.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.590
So next, best effort awards.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.050
These guys should really be
highlighted, because they

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.956
worked largely on their own.

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:29.011
Is that true?

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:29.510
Yes.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.090
Yeah, and that's certainly true.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.620
And there was certainly
a lot of people

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.760
who were impressed by the
Global Illumination stuff

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.410
yesterday, and sort
of mentioned that.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.820
And what I'm hoping to do
is take the judges' feedback

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.930
and sort of summarize
that for each team,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.260
so you can have some
constructive criticism back

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.810
that might be helpful.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.250
Molecular Dynamic
Simulation work

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.930
that you heard
about today, I think

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.240
certainly a valiant effort
on his part, as well.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.880
The most complete project,
I think this would probably

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.290
be Backgammon Tutor's project.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.550
I think in terms of scope
it was well defined,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.550
in terms of what they
actually completed.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.830
I think they came out
with a really cool game.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.120
My money was on them all
along to actually win

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.900
the first prize.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.780
But I think the Ray Tracing team
actually blew everybody away

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.730
with their demo.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.030
And I think they
were a clear winner.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.760
They really tackled sort
of their paralyzation,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.540
descendizing.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.530
They had a really cool
frame buffer demo,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.238
so they figured out
how to actually write

00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:32.110
to the frame buffer
and do that simulation,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.410
or do the graphics rendering.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.130
And I think some mumbling
about a real cool demo

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.830
that they've gotten
working overnight.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.580
So we'll try to set up
over in [? Stoddart, ?]

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.430
where we have pizza, and you
guys can take a look at that.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.490
So with that, I'll hand out
the certificates and the awards

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.890
offline.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.520
But you've at this
point been Cell-ified.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.250
And the cake is in the
back says, Congratulations

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.660
on your Cell-ification.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.020
So--

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.760
Resistance is futile.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.460
That's right.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.400
So thanks a lot for
taking the course.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.440
I think we've learned
a lot as instructors.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.300
I'm hoping to do this again
with Saman next year, next IAP,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.000
and maybe eventually turn it
into a regular semester course.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.620
I think there's a lot of
things we can do better,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.210
and hopefully you've told us
some ideas of how to do that.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.020
So with that, thanks, and start
enjoying cake in the back.

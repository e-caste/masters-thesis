00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.040
So far we've defined
work in one dimension.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.380
But let's consider
the path of a particle

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.520
in more than one dimension.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.700
And on this screen it looks
like a two-dimensional path,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.350
and here's our particle.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.930
And what we'd like to do is
define the concept of work

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.640
for this type of path.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.850
Now let's say that
at this instant

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.820
our particle is
experiencing a force F.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.190
And the particle is being
displaced by a distance, ds,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.100
which is always
tangent to the path.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.320
And what we'd like to do
now is talk about the work

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.450
done for this particle.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.450
Now what we'd like
to first say is

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.820
what we're going to do
is imagine that we're

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.970
going to break the
path down into a bunch

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.520
of small intervals.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.370
And let's call
this the j-th point

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.650
and the j-th plus 1 point.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.310
Then our particle
will start at j

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.120
and we'll displace it
delta sj to the j-th

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.370
plus 1 position on the path.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.960
And here, let's denote
the force by Fj.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.060
And now what we'd like
to do is define the work

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.440
for this particular section.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.910
Now our concept of
work is the force

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.970
in the direction of
the displacement.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.180
So what I'd like to do is I'd
like to define the quantity Fj,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.350
and I put a little parentheses
upstairs-- parallel lines

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.220
upstairs.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.720
This is the component
of the force Fj

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
in the direction of delta sj.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.840
Now the way we denote
that is we can then

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.430
say that if I take the dot
product of Fj dot delta sj,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.450
this is the component
of the force

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.020
in the direction of the motion.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.090
Because remember,
our dot product,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.170
if we call this
angle theta j, is

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.330
taking how much of one
vector is in the direction

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.150
of the other times the
magnitude of that displacement.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.570
And again, when we write that
component in our notation,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.000
if we call this
angle theta j, we

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.360
know that that's the magnitude
of Fj times sine of-- cosine

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.518
of theta j.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.350
Now because this is
the amount of force

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.420
in the direction of
the motion, that's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.850
how we've defined work done.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.730
And we'll symbolize
the work done

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.460
in taking the particle from j
to j plus 1 by the symbol Wj.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.160
And now, this is
a scalar quantity.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.500
And when we want to find
the total work, what

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.100
we have to add up is
from some initial point

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.250
to some final
point, how much work

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.470
is being done in
taking our particle

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.590
from the initial position
to the final position.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.430
And it's just the sum for all
of these j's, and let's say

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.180
we have n of them of Wj.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.200
And right now we're
going to call this W,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.390
it's just that scalar
sum, And, that's

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:26.030
equal to the sum j goes from
1 to n of Fj dot delta sj.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.684
So now we'll use the
vector dot product

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.100
because we already know that
this is how much of the force

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.650
is in the direction
of the motion.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.140
However, this answer depends on
how fine we broke up this path.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.450
And what we've
seen many times now

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.040
is that the actual work that
we want, let's write this as n

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.380
because it depends on
the number of paths,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.329
is the limit as n goes to
infinity of this sum of scalar

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.920
amounts of work.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.350
Now when we take that limit,
as n goes to infinity,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.640
of this sum, j equals 1
to n of Fj dot delta sj,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.190
this quantity is formerly what
we mean by a line integral.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.000
And we denote that
with a new notation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.640
We'll denote a line from
our initial to final

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.290
and it's a dot product
of the force dotted

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.530
into the small displacement.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.370
Now whenever we see the
dot product in an integral

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.970
that distinguishes it
from a normal integral,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.130
and this is what we
call a line integral.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.960
Now again, why did we switch
from our delta s's to ds's?

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.890
Because when we take the
limit, as n goes to infinity,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.070
our grid becomes
finer, and finer,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.690
and finer until we're
shrinking down to a point

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.800
where we can just talk about the
differential displacement, ds,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.390
and the force acting on a point.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.870
And that's what our
line integral is.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.180
Now, what we'll
learn next is how

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.610
to calculate this line
integral for a number

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.910
of important physical
examples that occur

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.040
in our interest in mechanics.

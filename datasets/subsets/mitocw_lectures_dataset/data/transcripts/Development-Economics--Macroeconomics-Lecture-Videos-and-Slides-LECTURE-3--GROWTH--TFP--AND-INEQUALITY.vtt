00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.479
ROBERT TOWNSEND: In terms of
where we are in the class,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.190
it seems like we
just got started,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.170
but it's actually
the third lecture.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.150
So after the end
of the day, we're

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.930
almost 1/4 done with a class.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.430
It's scary.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.373
Yeah, it's bad
news, not good news.

00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:50.040
There's another way
to think about that,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.440
which is there's no final exam.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.590
There are homeworks--
they're coming--

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.690
and TA sessions.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.180
But part of the
course is for you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.440
to write a research proposal,
not a paper exactly,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.690
but a research proposal.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.540
So that kind of
leads me into what

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.270
we're up to today and some sort
of encouragement and caution.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.440
We are trying to do
several things at once.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.650
One, of course, is to
look at particular papers

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.940
in the literature as exemplary
of what is out there.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.320
And actually, there, it
matters to get into the details

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.170
and really understand
the mechanics

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.560
and a few of the surprises.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.110
Some things are not
straightforward.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
And even narrowly, it will
raise questions about what

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.290
if they had assumed
this instead of that,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.840
or is there some
extension to this model,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.730
or there's something
I just really dislike

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.147
about this model?

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:52.980
You'll get inspired.

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:56.710
So we're doing that.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.060
But I'm also trying
to provide overviews

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.330
so you can actually see where
these particular trees fall

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.890
in the forest.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.110
And I'm not saying it's easy.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.200
It's not easy for me.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.860
And I, for example, spent
the weekend just thinking

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.390
about lecture one, lecture
two, and lecture three,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.900
sort of of writing up
English paragraphs about what

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.300
are these papers really
telling us and so on.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.680
So my point is be
patient with yourself.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.630
Don't be surprised
if occasionally it's

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.170
a bit bewildering because we
are covering a lot of material.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.680
But the reward will come
when you're thinking.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.320
Go back over the lectures,
think about the details

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.890
of particular papers.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.560
Maybe think about
it in the context

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.170
of your potential
research proposal,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.330
in terms of what you
might like to do,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.625
and I think you'll see
things start coming together.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.305
Yo.

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:56.805
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little more

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:59.760
about the logistics
of the proposal?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.190
So one thing is I was supposed
to talk to you before.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.100
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That
would be good, yeah.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.490
As I said, I'm usually around.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.710
I try to stay
around after class.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.990
I'm happy to iterate.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.760
It's like a research
conversation.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.870
You're thinking about x.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.690
You can get my reaction to
it, get Whit's reaction to.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.696
It

00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:25.960
AUDIENCE: And how far can we
go from this, from the macro

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.330
development into something else?

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.896
It has to be something that's--

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:34.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.030
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We should talk.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.942
I'm not sure what
you're asking me.

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:43.750
AUDIENCE: If I am doing
something that's more

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.560
micro-related, would that be--

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.000
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh, there's a
whole micro part of the class.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.500
We just haven't
gotten there yet.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.090
There's, like, two
lectures away, we

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.280
go through a whole
measurement lecture.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.770
And then we spend
almost the rest

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.340
of the class talking about
micro tests of this and that.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.010
And then we reintegrate
it and get sort of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.450
moved back toward the macro.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.090
Sometimes I teach
the micro first,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.220
waiting forever to
get to the macro part.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.230
This time we kind of
reversed it the other way.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.566
So micro is fine.

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.566
AUDIENCE: And just in
terms of timing, I forgot.

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:18.422
When is the proposal due?

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:20.769
Is it at the end
of your part, or--

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.590
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The
end of my part, yeah.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.940
And we reserve the last class,
and I can make it longer.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.050
As many of you as
possible should

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.250
think about actually presenting
and getting some practice

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.680
at presenting your ideas.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.500
OK.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.800
So today is mostly,
almost all of it,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.790
about limited commitment in
terms of obstacles to trade.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.170
And I'll try to highlight
where that's coming up.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.630
The topic, is of course,
macro-ish, growth, TFP,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.860
inequality.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.400
But it has these financial
market imperfections.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.525
And of course, that's the
bridge back to the micro.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.180
And the introductory
part of this,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.260
where I'm doing the big
picture, the forest,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.940
is broken down into three
segments, one of which

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.980
is highlighted, here
but I should tell you

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.850
about the other two.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.220
First of all, we're
going to start

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.590
talking about transitions.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.800
I was doing that last time.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.150
Some of this literature
is all about transitions

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.055
and about financial reforms
or real sector reforms.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.050
There is a second part of this
introductory section which is

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.970
entirely about cross-section.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.260
It's comparing one country
to another, and most of that

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.110
is in steady state.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.870
And finally, there is the
link between the two, which

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.710
is how much of
transitional dynamics

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.950
is really going to solve
the entire problem,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.750
and can you save your
way out of constraints

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.620
so that steady states look very
different from the transitions,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.140
or is there something left over.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.590
So you start off with what's in
the news all the time, rightly

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.450
so, which is China.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.634
And this paper is called
Growing Like China.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.360
And the question
starts with a puzzle.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.310
How can it be that a country
with measured high rates

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.030
of return is nevertheless
kind sending its funds abroad

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.355
for investing in low
rate of return assets?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.980
And China's in the
news for many reasons,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.500
but among other things,
it's just really

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.040
almost the fastest
growth rate in the world,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.860
and there's lots of
structural shifts going

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.480
on in terms of sectors and
a lot of privatization.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.180
We have return
investments above 20%.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.910
Savings rates have been
even higher than that.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.840
And China's accumulating-- its
savings well exceeds its demand

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.590
for credit, and its
foreign reserves

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.950
have to go to
trillions or something,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:43.750
from $21 billion to
$2,130,000,000 and so on.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.880
So here is another picture.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.230
This is those numbers.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.240
This is foreign reserves
and the difference

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.850
between deposits and loans.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.590
And not only is the difference
between deposits and loans

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.910
high, it keeps getting
bigger and bigger,

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.550
as do the foreign reserves
as a percent of GDP.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.890
You probably know this history.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.430
There was talks of
reforms way back in 1978.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.380
A lot of people date
the real turn in 1992,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.100
although additional
things happened in 1997.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.520
Just to look ahead a
bit, the next paper

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:34.500
we're going to talk about
is where Kaboski Shin,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.000
and they look at reforms
across a bunch of countries.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.360
And they used this 1992 date.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.340
But I think for any
particular country,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.470
it's kind of problematic
to pick one year

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.525
and say this is the
year of the reform.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.190
Very high investment rates.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.620
39% of GDP.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.525
Rate of return on capital,
at most, has fallen.

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:02.025
To 21%.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:10.350
Rate of return on capital in
manufacturing is close to 35%.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.780
Money should be flowing
in there, not flowing out.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:27.030
This is DPTE, I think, is
developing private enterprise

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.760
as opposed to
state-owned enterprise.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.770
And here you can see
early on, in 1992,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.520
the private sector was employing
relatively few workers.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.310
But this has been
increasing so that--

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.810
I guess this graph's
ending in 2006.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.129
Private sector is now
like 50% of employment.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.930
And here is the picture of
the share of investment.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.200
And this is a big part
of the story financed

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.180
by bank loans, distinguishing
state-owned enterprise

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.740
from basically these
developing private enterprise.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.610
So the point is, the
money from the banks

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:24.190
is going into these state-owned,
state-operated manufacturing

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.330
and other enterprises.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.620
They're getting something like
35%, if not 40% of their money

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.200
not from internal finance, but
externally through these banks.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.720
And the opposite is true.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.340
At best, this is now 10%.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.460
It used to be, like, 5%.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.740
So the private sector
is financing itself

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.860
with saving and
internal investment.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.710
So what's the story here?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.860
It's going to be a
story of reforms,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.380
and then this shrinking,
inefficient, state-operated

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:14.020
sector releasing labor into
the rest of the economy.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.120
And in fact, what's
going on here

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.810
is even though in principle,
the production functions have

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:27.130
diminishing returns, you don't
suffer from diminishing returns

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.220
for a long time
because you can get

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.640
all this quote, unquote
labor that's being released

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.470
by the other sector.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.440
In some sense we saw this
already with the Thai model

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.120
last time, where we had
labor and agriculture

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.330
at subsistence wages
being able to flow

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.100
toward these entrepreneurs.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.360
That's kind of happening here.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.700
It's not out of
agriculture, it's

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.650
out of government, enterprise.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.690
And there are some very
related seminal pieces.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.240
Arthur Lewis, one of the
pioneers of development

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.660
economics, and more
recently, Jaume Ventura,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.730
have talked about how you can
prevent diminishing returns

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.660
from kicking in.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.640
This is their view
of the literature.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.590
I'm going to skip it.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.580
You can look at
these slides later.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.730
Authors kind of
have different views

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.590
of what they do relative
to the literature

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.240
than the literature has about
what these guys are doing.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.382
Yes.

00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:37.480
AUDIENCE: In China
is there evidence

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:51.505
of in the time series of like
convergence in [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:52.880
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
I don't remember

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.400
the panel aspect of that.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.090
I mean, there is kind
of an average going

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.550
on here between these
inefficient state-owned

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.620
enterprises and the
private sector ones.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.320
And they go to an
extreme that the return

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.230
in the private sector
is basically constant.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.930
If the aggregate's rising,
it's because you're shifting

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.740
more and more toward these--

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.350
yes.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.892
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure that I
understood exactly the argument

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:22.800
they were [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.210
So was the idea that if I were
a local investor in China,

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.060
I want to invest in
the private sector,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.490
but I wouldn't be able to
because that money that

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.485
goes into the
financial sector China

00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:35.110
is funneled to
state-owned enterprises?

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.027
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.670
It's not modeled
deeply, but the idea

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.970
is there's constraints
on the borrowers.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.120
The private enterprise
sector would

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.540
like to borrow because the
rate of return is really high,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.380
and they would make more money.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.920
But there is a simple,
basically constraint

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.140
on the amount they're
able to borrow.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.830
So this is the limited
commitment/collateral

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.310
constraint.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.380
And that's the break.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.080
That's the key thing
that's preventing the money

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.440
from flowing, so they can't flow
from one sector to the other.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.540
It flows out because the country
overall is getting wealthier.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.410
OK.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.510
But this is one of
the papers where

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.160
we're going to go and study
the tree in some detail.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.865
And it's trickier than then
this English might imply.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.210
So this is the Buera Shin.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.270
Sorry, this one
doesn't have Kaboski.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.030
As the co-author,
unlike what I said.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.520
This is called Financial
Frictions and the Persistence

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.030
of History, A
Quantitative Explanation

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.050
so you know a lot of
people beyond China

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:03.800
have remarked on how successful
Asian economies have been

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.590
postwar for Japan and so on.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.040
And so they're going to study
the so-called Asian miracle

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.600
economies, and they're
going to date the reforms.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.860
And what their paper
is about is basically

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.590
if something had been
kind of a roadblock,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.710
and you remove the roadblock,
then these economies

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.190
might look like solo economies.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.580
And we'd expect a
very rapid convergence

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.930
as capital increases.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.530
But in fact, when you calibrate
these miracle economies the way

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.640
you would a solo model at
reasonable parameter values,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.240
although they're growing
remarkably over 20-,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.330
30-year periods, their growth
rates are lower than you would

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.010
predict and convergence is
slower than what a simple solo

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.000
model would predict.

00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:04.400
So they're going to
do this experiment.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.900
Now the thing, again, that's
going to be the key element

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.440
here is something like
a collateral constraint.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.440
So you have all this churning
and reallocation going on,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.290
but it can't happen right away.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:29.550
In fact, investment rates
rise, total productivity rises.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.910
But it takes quite awhile.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.190
What countries are
we talking about?

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.330
Japan, Korea-- that's
South Korea, by the way--

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.100
Malaysia, Singapore,
Taiwan, Thailand.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.720
Apologies for listing Taiwan
separately from China.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.210
I'm not going to get into
big diplomatic issues here.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.070
And this I already said.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.500
If you want to know something
about the parameters they

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.888
stick in, you can look at it.

00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:07.430
But here are some
beautiful pictures.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:17.200
So we have, say, per worker,
GDP relative to the US,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.640
this one is US
worker productivity,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.470
and it's GDP divided by workers.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.640
And you can begin to see the
labels of the countries here.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.230
This is the dating
of the reform.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.900
Talk about 1992 for China.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.000
Each country, they--
heroically, I'm sorry, confess.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.738
I mean, if you read the
history of Korea or Taiwan

00:17:43.738 --> 00:17:46.280
or whatever, it's really, really
hard to come up with a date,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.120
but they did.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.700
Thailand is in here.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.780
That's cool because we can
compare it to other papers

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.450
and so on.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.010
Japan.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.390
Singapore.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.960
That's per worker GDP.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.240
This is the investment out.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.240
Oh, this black line is kind
of the unweighted average

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.680
over all these countries.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.850
TFP.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:18.570
And private credit
relative, again, to the US.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.740
By the way, this is
that Thai credit boom

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.360
we talked about last time.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.975
Yes.

00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:27.890
AUDIENCE: How important is the
assignment of the zero date

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.040
here?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.900
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
They do not report.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.650
Presumably they played around.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.660
I hope they didn't cook it.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.010
I doubt they did.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.598
I know them quite well.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:43.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] And it's
just like in the series here.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.950
It looks like if you do the plus
or minus two or three years,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.890
you still get similar breaks.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.360
Maybe not plus two.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.230
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
you kind of hope that--

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.590
I mean, that kind of comes with
the fact that things are slow.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.370
Even if you believe that it's
a radical reform, the way they

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.020
construct their model economy,
it will happen slowly.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.880
So if you're off by a couple
of years in your dating,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.310
I don't know.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.620
There's hardly anything
here that really jumps.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.710
That's what you're saying.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.572
If you look at that line.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.030
For none of the
countries is there,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.690
like, something popping up.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.190
There's a slide
with interest rates.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.930
I didn't quite understand those.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.460
But that could
just be the reforms

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.780
because interest rates are--

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.020
however, that said,
ironically, their focus

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:42.420
is on subsidies and taxes
distorting the economy.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.380
And then the reform is
elimination of those wedges,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.750
but they leave the
financial sector intact.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.350
So forget what I said about
the interest rate picture.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:02.110
So here are these same, or
related variables, GDP, TFP,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.250
investment rates, and so on.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.250
Now keep an eye.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.525
The black lines are--

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.250
the light gray line
is the actual data.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.390
So this is what we're
trying to get at.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.300
I think that's an average
over the countries.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.730
And here's this interest rate
one that I don't understand.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.220
But anyway-- oh, and then
there's two other lines here.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.530
The dotted one is
where you basically

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.880
eliminate the financing
constraint in their model.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.420
And the lambda they
use, largely, this 1.35,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.800
is the black line.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.760
So what they're
claiming, and you

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.230
can decide whether
you believe it or not,

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:05.130
is that largely the data
are close to the black line

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.890
and pretty far away
from the dotted line

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:16.830
so that the financial frictions
really help in the explanation.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.310
So I'm frowning when
I'm looking at this.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.650
And then you should be inspired
because this is a famous paper,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.720
I think rightly so.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.830
And they're candid.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.850
Look at the data.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.310
It's like I showed
you my Thai data.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.560
I mean, it's not like
they're hitting a home

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.360
run on all these variables.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.468
Some of them look pretty far
away from either prediction.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.240
But again, I think they want
you to see the other end of it,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.330
that the transitions
at the dotted line

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:56.370
are just much faster than
sometimes even in their model,

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.240
but certainly,
then, in the data.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.612
That's the point of the paper
is how to slow down the growth.

00:22:03.612 --> 00:22:06.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So what you're saying

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.000
is that the lambda,
1.35, is what they use?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.930
So they basically
say that the reforms

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.270
don't eliminate everything.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.183
So there's still a lot of--

00:22:16.183 --> 00:22:17.100
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.580
So the idea is you've got these
lazy, untalented, rich firms

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.180
that are overfunded because
they're getting a subsidy.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.350
And you've got these lean, high
productivity, private sector

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.700
firms--

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.680
not state versus private, but in
this case, private with talent

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.810
and private without talent.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.850
And then you kind of
eliminate the subsidies end

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.680
and the taxes.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.330
And resources would like to flow
to the high productivity firms,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.820
but it doesn't happen
right away because you

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.370
jam into these
financing constraints.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.830
So it takes a long time.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:04.100
Now their model is going to have
forward-looking entrepreneurs.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.600
So these guys who are
talented but constrained,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.670
now not suffering from
taxes or something,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.970
they're going to be
saving at high rates

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.300
to try to overcome the
financing constraints.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.460
And eventually that kicks
in, but it takes time

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.970
to accumulate capital
sufficiently high value

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.930
to be able to collateralized it
to borrow some multiple and so

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.962
on.

00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:31.763
AUDIENCE: How do
they [INAUDIBLE]??

00:23:31.763 --> 00:23:33.430
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
They're using something

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.630
like the initial external
finance ratio credit

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.730
to GDP, which varies
across country.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.280
Yeah, so it's not--

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280
I don't know which land.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.780
Maybe that was a
particular country,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.490
and I didn't pay
enough attention

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.410
when I grabbed their slide.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.030
But it's different, certainly,
for different countries.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.610
And then they make a point
about these companies

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.990
hiring more and more workers
and getting bigger and bigger.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.200
And there's something
about factory employment

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.650
you might want to
take a look at.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.130
I'm not sure which data
set I grabbed that from.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.110
So the model we've
kind of talked

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:23.350
about how they pick parameters.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.310
Last lecture I
was kind of making

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.310
a big deal about estimating
parameters from micro data.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.080
This is more in the macro
tradition, where they're

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.570
calibrating parameters or
initial conditions the way

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.580
we were just discussing.

00:24:59.502 --> 00:25:00.460
So we've said all this.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:14.140
There is one exercise they do
at the end, where they basically

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.650
liberalize the financial
sector, not just get rid

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.700
of all the taxes and subsidies.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.020
Their language is a bit tricky.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.870
I read it three or four times
until I finally understood

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.280
what they were saying.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.100
They actually said that
helps slow things down.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.040
Now what they really
meant is the target

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.810
is better than it
was before, and it's

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.370
going to take a
little longer to get

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:42.690
there because the steady
state is quote, better.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:51.170
But in any event, I'm
not going to focus.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.830
This is practically the
last slide from them,

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.180
but you do need to face
choices about what reforms

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.260
you're looking at
in a given economy.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.560
And what I didn't say
last time, and this

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.630
could have been in
the other lecture,

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.090
is that if you look at,
in this case, Thailand,

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:17.610
and you look at measures of
total factor productivity,

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.920
you get the usual
sort of factor shares.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.200
Capital has the highest share.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.920
Land, someone asked me
about, is relatively low.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.000
Factor growth, well, this is
the increasing capitalization

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.620
of the economy.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.330
And then share times growth rate
kind of makes a contribution.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.320
That factors
contribution to GDP.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.350
And you can see a capital share
is almost equal to the total.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.800
So again, this is
capitalization going on.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:00.280
And as you get these
shifts out of sectors,

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.500
and this is a quick review,
we have the ratio of credit

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.650
to GDP on one scale and
financial access on the other.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.240
And you can see this
turning point in 1986.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.660
That's the credit expansion
measured at both the micro

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.730
and at the macro level.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.680
And the point here
about TFP is if you

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.860
feed that in through the model
we talked about last time,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.080
not only do you get
TFP, can actually

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.130
decompose actual TFP in Thailand
into the contribution that's

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.730
coming from this financial
deepening effect.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:44.003
And this is the fit of
the model predicted TFP

00:27:44.003 --> 00:27:47.280
to the measured Thai
version of TFP that's coming

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.540
from financial deepening.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.290
So roughly, that financial
liberalization in Thailand--

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.590
not other reforms, in this
case, just looking at financial

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.820
reforms--

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.780
actually explains something
like 78% of Thai TFP growth.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.740
And that kind of thing now,
for us, in Thailand, it's

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.550
all on the extensive margin.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.980
But for them, all of
their reallocation stuff

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.440
is going on the
intensive margin.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.780
There is no sector
in their model

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.470
that could not get credit
at least up to capital,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.600
whereas in Thailand,
they just didn't

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.110
have bank branches in
many parts of the country.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.870
So it's a different
interpretation.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:38.680
Now you know not everyone agrees
with what's going on in China.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.330
This paper is about
lifecycle savings.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:56.000
And they claim that the other
guys are missing the point.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.220
And in particular, savings
rates between the US and China

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.950
varied a lot.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:08.450
And they used to be more
similar than they are now.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.540
In 1988, savings rate
across the household sector

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.790
was roughly 5%.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.990
And basically, 20 years
later, savings rate in China

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.365
is up to 30% and the
US declined to 2.5%.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:30.610
And all the while, the
interest rates are coming down.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.190
So this is a puzzle for them.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.580
You know, what's going on?

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.730
Well, they construct a life
cycle model, basically.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.140
They construct a
life cycle model,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.350
and they're going to say,
basically, in the US,

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.320
young people are
saving less and less.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.200
Guess I should do a poll.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.740
Do graduate students save or
borrow up to your constraints?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.740
But in the US-- sorry,
I'm making light of it--

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.980
young people are
saving less and less.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.970
Actually, they're
borrowing more and more.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.390
So the decline in the
world interest rates

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.660
made credit cheaper
for young households.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.330
And they're taking
advantage of it.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.940
In China, it's the
the middle aged guys

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.030
who are saving more and more.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.230
Now the interest rate could
have gone the other way.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.210
But this is one of these cases
where the income effect trumps

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.370
the substitution effect.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.090
And eat now, eat later.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.380
There's two goods.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.660
What's the Engel
curve, so to speak?

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.320
Higher incomes have generated
higher savings in China.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.580
So time and time again, the
moral is you have a model.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.170
You may see things
that don't fit.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.670
We already have.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:12.110
Somebody else will come along
and try to exploit more data,

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.350
and either add to the puzzle
or provide an explanation

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.160
for things that weren't
fitting so well.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.530
Each model, by
construction, is not

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.150
trying to get at everything.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.620
Don't fall into that trap.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.250
It's easy to think, if
only we get it right,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.260
we'll have a totally realistic.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.660
All these models are
abstractions, to some degree,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.710
and they're kind of telling a
story about the growth process

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:37.800
that's informative.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.180
And if there are too
many moving parts,

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.490
not only could we not
tell a consistent story,

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.620
we're going have
trouble computing it.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.870
So what's very
typical here is to try

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:53.280
to explain why TFP
varies across countries.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.370
There's a huge literature on
this called growth accounting.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:03.320
And they're going
to attempt to model.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.040
This is where the Hsieh Klenow
stuff, in terms of measurement,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.700
comes in.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.230
But they're going to
feature something not just

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.580
in the aggregate.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.240
They're going to feature the
fact that poor, low income

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.130
countries not only have low
TFP, they have big differences

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.680
across sectors in
terms of productivity

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.540
and relative prices.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.550
In particular, the
manufacturing sector

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:33.630
is terribly inefficient
in low income countries,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.740
and the price of capital is
relatively high in low income

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.720
countries.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.230
And they'll construct
a model to explain

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.020
some of those TFP differences.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.580
So what's the driver here?

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.160
And this is one of the trees
we're going to study in detail,

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.500
so I don't want to
repeat myself too much.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.230
But the idea they
had, just to think

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.260
about how one model
differs from another one,

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.510
is to introduce not
only two sectors,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.270
but to have varying fixed costs.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.880
So the idea is this
manufacturing sector,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.310
as opposed to what
they call services,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:19.360
is the one that has these
very big fixed costs.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.680
So you can imagine that
with financing constraints,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.780
it's very hard for
people to invest

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.050
as they might want
to do in something

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:33.000
that requires a lot of
credit because the fixed

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.920
costs are so high.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.850
And they embed that
in occupation choice,

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:43.020
so people are choosing
whether to be a worker

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.750
or to operate a business in
one of the other sectors.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.420
So as I said, this is all
about cross-country data,

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.560
as if every country
were in a steady state.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.620
So they're going to
go across countries

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.420
that kind vary in the rate
of, say, external finance

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.960
or private credit to
GDP, and see what else

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.199
happens in the data as you
go across those countries.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.810
Where do they get
the parameters from?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:28.239
Well, day one I talked
about Rajan and Zingales.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.699
The other paper
does this as well.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.960
Basically, you act like the
US has wonderfully efficient

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.190
credit markets.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.900
A little harder to
swallow these days.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.360
And so things like the firm
size distribution in the US

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.120
is as it ought to
be, and everyone

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.179
has the same technology, but
they're credit constrained

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.889
and the US is not.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:54.699
So you sort of calibrate
the technology part

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:59.500
of the model based on the
US firm size distribution,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.640
or in this case, manufacturing
versus services as well.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.540
And then you stick that into
these models of the developing

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.030
country.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:17.340
Now quite relevant
to what we're trying

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.690
to do in terms of micro and
macro all at the same time

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.900
is they take that setup and
do a microfinance revolution.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.340
So again, there's the
usual collateral financing

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.000
constraint.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.850
It varies across countries.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:47.150
And then-- maybe I
can just jump here.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.980
Then what they do,
so people come in

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.480
and they have a certain
amount of wealth or assets,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.480
and then decide whether to be
a worker or an entrepreneur.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.000
Normally, the entrepreneur
faces some kind

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.170
of financing constraint
that depends on its wealth

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.070
and maybe on its talent,
and fee parameterizes

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.490
how binding that constraint is.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.890
And here's the revolution,
which is all of a sudden,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.890
you don't have to
be constrained.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:27.240
You can get a loan which has
nothing to do with your talent.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.980
And whatever your
asset level is,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.940
you get to borrow a fixed
size microfinance loan.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.830
So they embed that.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.160
The point is they're going to
embed it in general equilibrium

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.310
and then watch people
choose, kind of do

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.720
a controlled experiment.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:48.430
Actually, what they do
is a partial equilibrium

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.200
versus general
equilibrium version.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.110
So we can look at the
partial equilibrium version

00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:01.950
first, which basically says
that you start the economy off,

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.930
and then you do this
microfinance innovation.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.150
And most things are going up.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.980
Certainly output and capital
are going up over time--

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:19.880
sorry, it's cross-section--
go up as the amount of loan

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.590
from the microfinance
sector increases.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.290
All the economies are
alike at the beginning,

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.830
but the extent of the loan size
varies in the cross section.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.970
And you can see, the larger
the loan, the higher is output,

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.630
the higher is capital
in the economy,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.990
and not much is
happening with TFP.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.660
But it general
equilibrium, and you'll

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.910
see this more in a minute when
we go through the predecessor

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:53.750
model, both the wage and the
interest rate are endogenous.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:59.360
So when you provide credit, you
start shifting the occupation

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.740
choice of people.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.080
You start shifting
the amount of capital

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.480
they want to set
up and run firms.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.850
That is changing the
demand for credit.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.550
It also, as scale
varies, changes

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.010
the demand for employment
starts moving the wage around.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.050
And so the general equilibrium
effects are quite different,

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.670
namely output doesn't
move, even across economies

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.180
as credit is moving.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.300
Output, TFP, is
slightly increasing.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.912
And the economies are getting
less and less capital.

00:38:38.912 --> 00:38:40.331
Yes.

00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:42.230
AUDIENCE: How do we
read the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.446
How do we read the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:59.713 --> 00:39:00.630
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.240
I guess we'd have to
dig back into the paper

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.555
to get at the units.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.220
Part of it is I think
everything has been normalized

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.630
to have the same unit.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.430
I think the answer is it's
all relative to this initial--

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.670
because all three lines
have the same intercept,

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.400
and that's not likely
in any given model.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.540
So this is meant to get at what
happens in the cross-section

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.130
as you increase the
amount of credit.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:36.074
That's why they more or less
all fit on the same diagram.

00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:38.320
AUDIENCE: How do you
read [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.237
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:39:39.237 --> 00:39:40.940
This is, again, a
microfinance loan.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.690
This is just the size
of the loan relative,

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.270
I think this is to initial
wealth or something.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:58.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] down
because the guys are having

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:07.410
more access to finance because
[INAUDIBLE] we get more capital

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.473
because there are less
constrained or something.

00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:13.140
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I'm
trying to remember.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.515
It all has to do with the
interest rates and the wages.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.330
I think the interest
rates are going down.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.320
Look at one more picture
and see if that helps.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.050
Otherwise, we'll have
to dig out the paper.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.230
This is for a given
economy as you

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.510
fix the level of the
microfinance loan

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.530
and then vary wealth.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:55.560
So it turns out that in partial
equilibrium, more or less,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.900
the benefits are
the same by wealth.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.740
But in general equilibrium,
it's the relatively poor people

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.290
who are able to take advantage.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.000
Maybe the wage is going up.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.640
That's part of it.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.040
So those untalented people who
are workers are benefiting.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.860
That has to be true.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.740
By talent, over
here, by ability,

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.770
it's not true that
the low ability guys

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.020
are the primary beneficiaries.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.360
Basically, the peak is here,
both in general and partial

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.650
equilibrium, although
in general, you

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:40.230
can see that the general
equilibrium makes the peak

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.690
less, and it drops further.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:47.700
So the weak statement is
the most able entrepreneurs

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.340
in the country are not
benefiting from microfinance,

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.340
and they may actually be
hurt from microfinance

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.890
when you take into account the
general equilibrium effect.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.980
I think that's also
the wage going up.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.480
Yes.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.790
AUDIENCE: So the wage is
starting point 8 Is it

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.611
the same all the way to zero?

00:42:05.611 --> 00:42:07.102
The x axis?

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I
don't recall enough

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.870
about how they calibrated this.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:23.040
Yeah, it's either the same, or
they've truncated the ability

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.325
distribution so the units
actually start up here at point

00:42:26.325 --> 00:42:29.010
8 than at 0.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.170
But the point is yeah,
the action is here.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.060
The same comment,
your same question

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.460
would apply here in terms of
what is the scale of wealth.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.930
AUDIENCE: It was the same
all the way down to--

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.138
suppose that we thought,
oh, this is not a rescaling,

00:42:47.138 --> 00:42:48.860
and it shoots all the
way down to the 0.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.610
That would be remarkable
if literally they

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.875
were just the same
from point 8 to 0.

00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:57.030
And it's like the only
action occurs at the end.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.488
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Remember, you have

00:42:58.488 --> 00:43:02.000
this crucial cutoff about who
wants to be running a firm.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.090
You can be a wage earner,
and whatever the wages are,

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.700
they're fixed in equilibrium.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.190
That's the best option for
many, many, many people.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:14.090
You have to be sufficiently
talented to climb over

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.905
that threshold and
want to run a firm.

00:43:16.905 --> 00:43:19.280
And when you're running a
firm, you could be constrained.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.990
You could have--
like China, you could

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.440
have very high marginal returns,
but with that collateral

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.200
constraint, you can't
borrow very much.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.190
So even though you have
this amazingly high return,

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.900
you can't exploit it.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.360
So the levels of
profit stay low.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.540
OK.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.130
Well, it may be
frustrating that we

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.320
can't go into the details
of this thing more.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.740
But in terms of quote,
the big picture,

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.880
you can see them making use
of these kinds of models

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.910
to examine a very
relevant experience.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.750
Most evidence we
have on microcredit

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.680
is at the micro level, and
it's almost, by construction,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.880
partial equilibrium.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.240
Joe and I tried to remedy that
because Thailand put money

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.020
in every village, and the
villages vary in size.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.550
So we actually started to see
the wage moving a little bit.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:20.530
But mostly, microcredit, as
in RCTs, by construction,

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.480
is going to have a partial
equilibrium effect.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.990
But these, what's
going on in Bangladesh?

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.530
The whole country's got it.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.120
And we don't see the
country without it.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.120
But that's why we
need the model,

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.520
to get to these counterfactuals.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.870
And I'm going to skip
Joaquin's dissertation.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:43.860
It's on inequality.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.350
It's quite interesting.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.360
And I'm going to skip this thing
about alleviating constraints

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.200
in the long run.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.500
But we'll come back
to it in homework

00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:00.590
and so on with Abhijit and
Ben Moll on the persistence

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.690
of misallocation.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.540
So let's get into the
details of this China paper.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.110
I think you spent some time
at the beginning of class.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:19.498
So maybe I can get by with
not having to re-motivate it,

00:45:19.498 --> 00:45:20.790
and we'll start with the model.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.630
So it is an overlapping
generations.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.130
That's always a bit heroic.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.878
Of course, it makes the
thing much more tractable

00:45:28.878 --> 00:45:30.420
because you've only
got, essentially,

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.250
two periods of
life to worry about

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.500
in the dynamic optimization.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.490
Everyone's got the same
preferences, by the way,

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.350
whether you're
going to be a worker

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:46.190
or running a private firm.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:51.950
And it's over consumption
today and consumption tomorrow.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:57.560
Theta is a power and beta
is the discount rate.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.030
Workers.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.970
There's not much of an
occupation choice thing here.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.660
Basically, it's almost
as if exogenously, you've

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.770
got workers versus
entrepreneurs,

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.300
so they downplay that
choice, unlike the paper

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.560
we just looked at.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.380
Workers earn some wage.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.230
And what do they
do with the money?

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:25.590
They can put it in the bank
at some interest rate RT.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.960
We'll come back to
that momentarily.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.650
Entrepreneurs are managers
in entrepreneurial firms,

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.950
and they earn
something that makes

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:39.590
them want to do that rather
than be a wage earner.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.110
Now I just got done saying
that there's not really

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:44.690
any essential occupation
choice, but that's

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.000
because they parameterize
this thing so

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.450
that this return that
an entrepreneur can get

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:56.700
is always greater than
the wage in equilibrium

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.840
at the parameters they choose.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.468
What can they do
with their money?

00:47:01.468 --> 00:47:03.260
They could also put
their money in the bank

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.500
at the same rate of
interest, or they

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.480
could put it in their firm.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.430
But like we've been
saying, the rate of return

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:15.983
is going to be really high on
internal self-financed savings.

00:47:15.983 --> 00:47:18.150
So that's what they're going
to do with their money.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.820
They don't put it in the bank.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.250
So that's higher than the rate.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:30.760
And some sort of things
to keep an eye on.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.490
The population is
growing at some rate.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.800
I don't know why they did that.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:43.920
I don't know whether they needed
to get the model paths closer

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.160
to the data.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.770
But anyway, that
is in the model,

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:51.810
and I'm not going to
talk about it very much.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.820
Big story is
productivity differences

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.030
between state and
private enterprise.

00:48:00.242 --> 00:48:01.700
And here's the
production function.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.330
So there's two types
of technologies.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:10.340
There's kind of a centralized
and a decentralized technology.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.880
The decentralized technology
is going to require managers.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.730
In effect, the
centralized one doesn't

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.510
take advantage of
having managers,

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.520
and I'll tell you why.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.250
It's pretty artificial.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:26.400
But for now, just
note some things here.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.600
There is this exogenous
technological progress,

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.680
so that's kind of
classic macro stuff.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.250
This A has a T on it.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.380
It's going to be
growing over time.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.680
But it's labor augmenting.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.960
It's not sitting out here
in front of the production

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.800
function.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.530
It'll be there in a minute,
but it's going to carry,

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.125
inherit this 1 minus alpha
when you pull it outside.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.660
Here's the Chi thing.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:04.450
So if you're in the
decentralized private sector,

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:10.050
then that technology
is augmented by Chi.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.320
Chi is greater than 1.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.430
Now the idea is, why
doesn't everyone do this?

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.670
And even the
state-financed firms,

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.825
they kind of tell a story.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.510
And the story is basically--

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.836
let's look at the
decentralized firm first.

00:49:38.836 --> 00:49:42.130
The decentralized
firm has capital.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:47.300
Initially, it comes
from somewhere.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.320
But during the production
period, it's predetermined,

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.800
and then they can hire labor,
and they can hire managers.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.220
Managers need to be
paid some compensation.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:02.940
Why this thing?

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:08.110
So the idea here is a manager
can basically steal the output,

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:08.920
walk off with it.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.340
And so that's the psi,
the pitchfork thing.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.970
So that's kind of like
the financial distortion.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:22.610
That's going to
drive this thing.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:26.920
The higher is phi, the
more the manager can steal.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.170
And in fact, here's the thing.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.230
They're saying
monitoring somehow

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.800
prevents these hired
managers from walking off

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.210
with anything, but everything.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.000
But only the decentralized
firms have this monitoring

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.150
technology.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:44.280
The state-operated enterprises
are so darn inefficient

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.582
that basically,
psi is equal to 1.

00:50:46.582 --> 00:50:51.220
So forget having managers.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.420
So that's the story.

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:58.680
But it's really rigged, meant
to tell a little deeper story

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.060
than just imposing a
finance constraint.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.620
So this will be at equality.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.050
You're going to have to pay
the managers that amount

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.540
just so they don't steal.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.250
And then plug that
in, and you get

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:15.500
the sort of maximization
problem, which

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.030
is now just maximizing.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.900
And you can see, after you pull
out the factor labor, factor

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.740
productivity, that you
get stealing is not good.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.960
That lowers it, that
chi is greater than 1

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.360
raised to a power,
that raises it.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.510
So this is kind of the
productivity effect

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.690
of running a private firm.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:39.070
Yes.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.468
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
It's fixed so far.

00:51:41.468 --> 00:51:45.050
But it's actually going to be
determined in this overlapping

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.580
generations model.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.250
People who plan to
be entrepreneurs

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.765
in the second period will save.

00:51:56.226 --> 00:52:00.110
AUDIENCE: This would have
been identical [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.110
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
you could have done that.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:08.880
OK.

00:52:12.247 --> 00:52:13.390
I said this.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:29.710
So this is just that
production function notation.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.270
It's the same
production function

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:35.210
for both except for the chi.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:41.680
And the notation substitutes
in entrepreneurial firms

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.430
versus financially
integrated firms.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.290
F for financially integrated.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.060
But they're not efficient guys.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.100
They're inefficient guys.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:55.280
And here's that
productivity marching along

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.295
following this sort of
exogenous mark-off process.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.790
But the important friction
is when I showed you

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:18.260
that problem, or maybe it's
not clear, not so clear yet

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:22.640
that these private enterprise
guys are limited in the amount

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.130
that they can borrow.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.701
Yes.

00:53:25.701 --> 00:53:27.076
AUDIENCE: So the
z is just shock?

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.370
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It's boring.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.550
It's boring, but it's a big
part of real business cycle

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:36.085
analysis.

00:53:36.085 --> 00:53:37.710
The whole point of
real business cycles

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.520
is those aggregate shocks
are driven by basically

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.150
something like z or TFP.

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:48.750
So they inherited
that part of it.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.600
I'll show you where it enters.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.520
It's going to generate some
exogenous this growth rate.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.550
But it's not going to be
enough to explain China.

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.960
As we were saying
earlier, you've

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.640
got to put in some other
financing restrictions

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.160
to try to match
up with the data.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:08.660
OK.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.290
So the rate on
deposits is going to be

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.350
equal to the rate at which
you can lend internationally.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.510
This is, like, US
Treasuries, and that's

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:19.440
where the money goes.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.500
Lending, there's a little bit of
a markup, sort of not modeled.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.330
You have to charge more on your
lending rate since some of it

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:36.450
gets chewed up in the
intermediation process.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.380
And this [INAUDIBLE] thing
is basically that markup.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.390
So it subtracts off
from the lending rate

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.330
to be equal to the deposit rate.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:49.780
OK.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.905
So we do a little algebra.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.990
And I'll try to
let you know where

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.110
the equations are coming from.

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:11.720
So this kappa, not k, is a
ratio of capital to labor.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.770
But the labor is augmented by
that augmenting technological

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.130
progress.

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.550
So as you may know, if you've
worked through these things

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.270
before, you have a Cobb
Douglas production function.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.190
You want to look for
wages and interest rates.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:32.870
Well, for example, the
marginal product of capital

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.920
will be set equal to
quote, an interest rate,

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.380
in this case the lending
rate, because that's

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.940
where you can borrow.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.010
And it ends up being--

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.685
it is this.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.680
Over the weekend I reworked
all these equations just

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.350
to make sure I could
do the algebra.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.730
This one's pretty standard.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:55.947
Some of them get a bit
tricky, but it probably

00:55:55.947 --> 00:55:57.780
is going to take too
much of our time to try

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:02.175
to do it from scratch here.

00:56:02.175 --> 00:56:04.300
But I will try to give you
some guidance about what

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:09.160
substitutions are going on and
why they're doing it this way.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.910
The wage is the marginal
product of labor,

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.700
and this is an
expression for the wage.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.800
Now that seems odd, except
why not solve for labor?

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:29.400
The point really is that
this is fixed from abroad.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.110
That's going to fix kappa.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.490
And once kappa is fixed,
then basically the wage

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.540
is going to be
constant if it were not

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.200
for that technological progress.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.160
So the general equilibrium
is made a lot easier

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.950
here because they're able
to get these closed form

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:49.840
solutions for the wage
and the interest rate.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:06.510
So again, where we're going is
resources are going to flow.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.990
Labor in particular is
going to start flowing out

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:13.170
of the state-owned enterprises,
but it doesn't do anything

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.040
to the wage.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.430
And the interest rates are
pinned down internationally.

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:20.500
So to the extent the economy's
getting richer and richer

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.420
and there's no place
for that money to go,

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420
it's going to go abroad.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:26.560
Yes.

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:39.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to provide entrepreneurs

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.620
with the incentives
to work as manager,

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:48.340
and they have to be greater
than this wage [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.210
How to guarantee [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:54.530
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, they
set the parameters such

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:55.250
that that's true.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.760
There's always this
tension about where

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.700
the parameters come from.

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.140
So I'm drawn to micro
data because then I

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.710
can estimate something that
I'm willing to believe.

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:15.240
Other people like
to calibrate them.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.055
Now, if you're telling
a story, the story

00:58:17.055 --> 00:58:18.680
of China through the
lens of this model

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.290
is going to be consistent
with big chunks of the data.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:23.720
So they're probably just
happy to find a parameter that

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.130
makes the story accurate.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:34.810
Different people have
different tolerance levels.

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.470
OK.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:41.280
So here are these
private sector firms.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.430
After you substitute in for
m in a previous expression

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:51.090
that we just talked about,
it's just choosing employment.

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:54.800
And you get the first
order condition.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.150
Now this is a trick that
turned out to be handy.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:00.172
Why isn't the wage?

00:59:00.172 --> 00:59:01.880
Well, they took the
first order condition

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.015
and they multiplied
by n, and they put n

00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:07.280
on both sides of this thing.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.930
So there is a
substitution in there.

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:13.310
That's because this
analytic expression--

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.340
the wage bill turns
out to get used later

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.860
and they wanted an
expression for it.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.640
What is n?

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.170
Basically, it's this thing.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:26.580
So the employment in
these private sector firms

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.485
is proportional to the capital.

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:33.730
In fact, many, many
things, almost everything

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:36.760
in this model, is going to
be proportional to capital.

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:44.160
and the thing that
does move, if anything,

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.810
is basically this productivity.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:51.490
But a certain ratios are
going to stay constant,

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:53.650
even if some of the
levels are moving.

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:56.540
So here is the wage.

00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.800
We substitute that
wage back into 2,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.000
and we get this
expression for the profits

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.650
of the private sector.

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:10.890
And the point is this thing
on the right-hand side,

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:12.540
it's just linear.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.150
So despite what
you might thought

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:17.490
would be the
diminishing returns,

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.430
the fact is they're able
to hire enough labor

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.380
on the extensive
margin at a fixed wage

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.940
so they don't get hit with
those diminishing returns.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:29.140
And for the transition
that they want to analyze,

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.180
it's basically what
they call a AK model,

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.650
not to confuse the notation.

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:39.300
It's linear, so basically,
Rho is really high.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.280
I'm going to go bananas.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.650
Give me more k.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:44.220
K is good.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.060
I can make money.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.580
Rho is a lot higher than R.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.635
No, no, no, no.

01:00:48.635 --> 01:00:50.010
There's going to
be a constraint.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.510
That's the financing constraint.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:58.760
But it really helps the
dynamics to figure it out.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.640
So again, what is that Rho?

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.330
It's this thing.

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.365
And these are all
basically parameters,

01:01:05.365 --> 01:01:06.240
interest rates fixed.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.990
Alpha's labor productivity,
capital productivity.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:14.130
Pitchfork v was a
distortion from stealing,

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.827
that chi was this
exogenous productivity

01:01:16.827 --> 01:01:17.910
in the state-owned sector.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.820
Everything on the right-hand
side is just a number.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.940
And this thing is
set, parameter choice

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.430
set to be greater than 1.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.620
So that's going to be
the driver of China.

01:01:32.267 --> 01:01:34.850
And it would happen right away
if it weren't for the borrowing

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:35.420
constraint.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.730
So where do you get money from?

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:40.930
OK, a little lesson on
financing, which you

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.800
already know.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.250
But in the notation,
we asked about k.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.100
Where did k come from?

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.210
K, at the beginning of the
period, is predetermined,

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.590
but it came from last period
saving and from the amount

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.850
that they borrowed.

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.410
So that's the timing.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.390
And it's the saving of
the entrepreneur who's

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:07.460
going to be running that
firm when they're older,

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.030
and they save when
they're young.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.530
OK.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:18.070
So this L is kind of like
L, liquidity, the amount you

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:20.450
can borrow, could be 0.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:34.040
But basically you've got to pay
back those loans because you

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.990
borrow them at interest.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:40.580
And so the amount
you've got to pay back

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.055
is going to be bounded
by your profit.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.120
And then they're
kind of rewriting

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.170
the expression for that.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:57.580
So we imagine this is binding.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.840
This is where the
credit constraint is.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.490
You're limited to pay back
the loan out of, basically,

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:10.080
next period's profits,
or a proportion of it,

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.690
I should say, with factor eta.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.050
So the so-called
leverage ratio, which

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.350
is credit to the total
amount of financing,

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.290
both internal and
external, is basically

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.932
just this fixed number.

01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:26.640
A lot of this we've
already talked about.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.610
We just threw in
another parameter.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.360
OK.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.820
So back to the entrepreneur
maximizing utility

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.150
with those preferences.

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:50.220
When they're young,
they're basically

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.890
getting the managerial
compensation less the savings.

01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:59.880
And when they're older, they
get the return on the enterprise

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:07.050
that they're quote,
running, plus

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:12.590
they get this extra kick because
the more they can borrow at RL,

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:16.010
which is fixed, given that
Rho E is higher than that,

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:19.580
they get a return
on the resources

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.550
that they got from externally.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.100
So they have money from
their own internal rate,

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.350
on their own savings,
and then money

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:31.130
from, quote, profits
that they get

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:36.240
being able to borrow at a lower
rate than their rate of return.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.890
And you can decompose this
into the return, the premium,

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:46.420
and the leverage ratio,
all in a given period,

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.540
multiplied by the savings rate.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.920
When we get to
measurement, we're

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.250
going to talk a lot about
where does wealth come from.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:55.820
Wealth comes from saving.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.120
There's a savings
rate, and then there's

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.040
the rate of return
you get on saving,

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040
which is like TFP, or
basically factor productivity.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.400
This is effect, with some
leverage, the productivity you

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.020
get on given levels of saving.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.690
The point is that this
is all a constant,

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:24.330
so the savings is just going
to be proportional to m.

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.310
Now again, I looked at
this over the weekend.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:27.390
I'm like, huh?

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.040
How is that coming from this?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.390
Well, no, no, you got
to go back up here.

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:34.960
And remember, you're going
to get an Euler equation

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.540
because you're going to be
sacrificing consumption today

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.630
as you say more, and you're
going to get something out

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.060
tomorrow with a fixed return.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.970
And given these preferences
raised to a power theta,

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:53.630
you get a nice expression
for the savings rate.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:55.930
The rate is constant,
and it's just

01:05:55.930 --> 01:06:00.760
proportional to their income.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.950
So again, do you like it?

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:02.550
I don't know.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:03.797
It's special.

01:06:03.797 --> 01:06:05.005
But it's part of the algebra.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.470
It's easy to tell
the story in English.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:10.940
When you get to
the equations, you

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.380
realize assumptions
are being made.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:13.880
Yes.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.100
Question?

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:29.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.060
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.550
The way I'm giving
this, probably not

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:36.350
the most complimentary way.

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.560
I'm basically saying they're
making up the parameters.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.300
If there's something
disciplining

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:45.200
the other parameters, then
you need eta to be less than 1

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.390
in order to be
able to tell this.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.190
And the other papers
in the literature

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.610
are clearly doing that.

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.565
AUDIENCE: But my question is,
why do you need an extra--

01:06:55.565 --> 01:06:57.190
these firms have to
pay their managers.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:58.918
So the chi has to be--

01:06:58.918 --> 01:07:00.960
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
it's a very good question.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.835
And we'd have to go--

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.250
unless it pops up shortly
in the next few equations,

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.490
then I would have to
go back to the paper

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:12.530
and tell you which
particular piece of data

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:15.980
are they trying to fit for which
they need that eta as opposed

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.660
to the other things.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.410
So then we get to the
aggregate dynamics.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:30.270
Well, this is the return
on Firm I. But it's linear,

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:34.480
so basically you can
you can aggregate up.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.480
So you're really
going to use or abuse

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.100
this algebra pretty heavily.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.610
The linearity makes it easy
to get the total output

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.670
in the entrepreneurial sector.

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:47.100
Now here are some
other ingredients.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.740
We've already seen
that wages and levels

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.320
are proportional to output
because of the stealing

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.420
parameter.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.600
But output, we already
just saw on the last slide,

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.755
is proportional to capital.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:07.220
Also, managers save a constant
rate out of their earnings.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:12.620
And we just saw that the
leverage ratio is constant.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.810
So lots of things are constants.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.790
Other things are proportional.

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:21.260
Basically, the capital
stock is the key driver.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:28.284
And it's moving with exogenous
technological progress.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.029
So the ratio of output
from one period to the next

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.670
is the same as the ratio
of the capital from one

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:42.560
period to the next,
and they're all

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.295
equal to this common constant.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:52.665
So the entrepreneurial
sector, therefore, is growing.

01:08:52.665 --> 01:08:54.290
We've gone from levels
to growth rates.

01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.529
That's the point.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:58.140
So now we can talk
about how fast

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.359
is the private sector
in China growing.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.160
Here's the financially
integrated,

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.550
inefficient
government-financed firms.

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:15.770
And this is another
expression for output.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:20.819
This is the output of the
private enterprise sector.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.750
Just to take you
through the algebra

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:25.470
so it's not too
much of a mystery,

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:31.740
they've deliberately gotten
this term in the expression.

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.859
That was the whole point of
re-manipulating the output.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:39.090
And this expression is
something you can figure out

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.810
from all the other things we
did on the past four slides.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:45.149
So you get a simple
expression in terms

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:53.550
of kappa and parameters for this
adjusted ratio of total capital

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:56.880
to total labor.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.130
You start substituting
that in here.

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.890
That's where it went.

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:05.040
And you do a little
more manipulation,

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.910
and you can get output per
worker in the whole economy.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:18.000
So this is a version of labor
productivity for all of China.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.320
And of course, output is the
sum of the output in the two

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:21.890
sectors.

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:27.780
Total labor is still n here.

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:32.110
But you can look at output as
a function of labor employment

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:35.230
from these tricks,
controlling for kappa

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.870
and this productivity,
and you finally

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:41.080
get the story, the
bottom line, which

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.360
is the total output of
the economy is growing.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.840
Why?

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.050
One, not too surprising.

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:52.060
It's exogenous
technological progress.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:57.280
But the other is that
this thing is growing.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.910
So employment in the
enterprise sector

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:03.550
relative to the whole
economy, this thing

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:09.170
is going up because the
enterprise sector is expanding,

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:12.657
drawing employment slowly.

01:11:12.657 --> 01:11:13.740
And here are the diagrams.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:24.140
So one thing, I made a
little joke about Thailand

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.260
exhausting agriculture and
no one living there anymore,

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.110
and how you got this
knife edge on the wage.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.750
They also have the
same thing going on.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.435
At some point, this process
slows down or stops.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:45.260
Now eventually, you'll
draw employment out

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.760
of that state-owned sector.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.460
It will disappear.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.610
And at that point the wage
is going to start to go up.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.970
This isn't totally realistic
because the wages are rising

01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.020
in China, to some extent.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.870
But they were low
for quite a while.

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:03.590
I don't know.

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:05.750
The date's supposed to be 1992.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.580
Yes.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.560
This is the firm
employment share, which

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.395
again, goes up until it hits 1.

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:16.990
So you see the parallel
with what we did before.

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:18.880
It's just we've
relabeled the sector,

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.900
and the algebra and the
assumptions are different.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.350
But here you get output
growing, and then

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:29.320
you hit the sort of
diminishing returns at cap

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.910
T. Is the end of China.

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:32.230
No, just kidding.

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:34.990
I keep looking at these guys.

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:37.855
The T is when you've exhausted
this transition process.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.800
And here's the foreign
surplus to GDP.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.620
We'll get to that in a minute.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.300
And here's the
aggregate savings rate

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.950
going up very dramatically.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.340
So by the way, that
demography paper

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.650
that claimed other
people don't get

01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:58.420
an increase in the
aggregate savings rate

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.650
is wrong because it is
happening in this model.

01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:01.150
Yes.

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:06.370
AUDIENCE: Do we know from
later on the data from China

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.560
on, I guess, state and
private employment,

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.120
and also, like
you're saying, data

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.540
on the wage, if we're
to believe this model,

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.550
how long the
transition will go on.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, I
guess that's the key question,

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.190
and I don't think
they focused on that,

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:29.360
unlike the previous paper.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.030
The data, you're reminding me
to say something about that.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.300
So they actually
look by, I guess,

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.440
it's province within China.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.470
And they're saying that areas
with growth in private sector

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:46.760
employment are areas that are
basically having high savings

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.600
rates.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.820
So they're actually fitting
it a bit within the country.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:55.830
The other thing I remember
to say is China Data Center.

01:13:55.830 --> 01:14:01.780
So as per our continuing
conversation about GIS,

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:04.290
there's a --they're
housed at Michigan,

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.350
partly funded by Michigan,
but also Purdue and the Luce

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.060
Foundation and so on--

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:15.390
and they are putting tons
of data on GIS archive,

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.250
and you can generate maps.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:20.550
Actually, MIT is a subscriber,
so you can get a lot of this

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:23.010
if you go to MIT GIS.

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:26.010
You can find China Data Center.

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:28.170
I actually put it on my
syllabus and I'd forgotten

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.142
to mention it up to this point.

01:14:30.142 --> 01:14:32.100
So there's probably a
lot of interesting things

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.053
you could do with
the Chinese data.

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:37.470
I'm not saying they have all
of it there, and some of it's

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:39.380
confidential.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:39.880
All right.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.510
Here's the story of
the capital outflows.

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:49.750
You've got investment.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.400
Well, you've got deposits.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.450
Little lesson on flow of funds.

01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:57.710
You've got the deposits
coming from the workers.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.570
Wages times employment.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:06.610
And they're going to put
that times a parameter.

01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.140
They do eat some.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.270
And that money has
to go somewhere.

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:17.248
It can go into investment,
or it could go in lending

01:15:17.248 --> 01:15:18.290
to the rest of the world.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.660
And they actually
solve this equation

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.100
with all this other
algebra, which

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.510
by now is too bewildering.

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.820
You wouldn't be
able to replicate it

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:26.780
right off your head.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:34.010
But basically, this borrowing
is coming from a constant term,

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:35.450
lending to the
rest of the world--

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:36.450
funny thing to call it--

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:43.310
B is coming from a constant term
this increase in TFP, partly,

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:45.150
that's driving it,
and then this thing.

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:48.470
So the big story
here is that when

01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:51.840
the state owned enterprise
sector is shrinking,

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.300
it's releasing resources.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.780
They're the big
borrowers, and so they're

01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:59.320
borrowing less and less.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.290
So that's a big part of
the money going abroad.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:05.600
OK.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.700
So I'm going to just
settle on giving you

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:14.750
an outline of this paper and
let you look at the slides

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:19.380
at your leisure, so to speak.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:25.200
This is the motivation
we've talked about,

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.961
which is relative prices in TFP.

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.060
Let me find key equations.

01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:38.970
So there's two
sectors, and there's

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:42.060
a fixed cost, which is
higher in manufacturing

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.310
than service sector.

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:49.110
There is this entrepreneurial
ability, and there's wealth,

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.690
and then there's
this credit friction.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:59.910
Now again, this
production technology

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:01.590
looks like Cobb Douglas.

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.450
It has decreasing
returns to scale,

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:11.510
but it's augmented by z, which
was a, sort of a version of it.

01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:15.470
And now what makes
this more challenging

01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:21.570
is it's supposed to have
a realistic optimization,

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.550
infinite horizon.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:27.400
Everyone is maximizing
discounted expected utility.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.310
There's no heterogeneity.

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.210
But good luck solving this.

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:36.900
They do, or partly computing.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:39.190
So it's sort of a CDS.

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:41.970
There are two goods, the service
sector and the manufacturing

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:43.500
sector.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:48.300
And this pitchfork thing is sort
of the weight between the two.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.640
You're picking up
parameters, by the way.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.200
Be mindful of that.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.900
Beta, sigma, something
that looks like an epsilon.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.360
And this phi.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.430
And there's going to
be a calibration slide.

01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:06.460
They're going to have to
choose all of these and others.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:12.090
So here's a picture
like the one I showed.

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.100
From the point of a
person, you start off

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:17.610
with a certain amount of
wealth from previous period,

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.105
and then you get a draw
of your talent, which

01:18:20.105 --> 01:18:21.480
can vary depending
on whether you

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.870
go into the small
or the large sector.

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:30.095
You could be a worker and just
work and produce and consume.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.530
Or you could go into one of
these sector J's and produce.

01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.220
This is work.

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.630
This is produce and consume.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:42.170
Now this gamma, this is a
bit more realistic version

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:47.790
of talent or productivity.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:51.450
This z that you have
at the beginning

01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:55.720
is likely to be the
same at the end.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:01.650
But every so often,
you lose your ability,

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:06.120
or this is a stand-in for
sectors that are changing

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.995
in an unmodeled way here.

01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:09.870
In fact, they're going
to draw this parameter

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:15.440
from exits of firms in the US.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.990
Bad stuff happens, you
have to go out of business,

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:19.276
technologically.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:28.100
So you have these
value functions.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.350
They're going to
have to iterate.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:34.440
You have ability
and wealth today,

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.860
and you're going to
try to maximize wealth,

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.940
your value for
wealth and ability

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.390
tomorrow with your
contemporaneous utility,

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:46.150
the choices.

01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:49.380
This is classic, very
limited market-type stuff.

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.750
You basically
[INAUDIBLE] or save.

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:55.490
Maybe you could borrow
if this goes negative.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:58.770
You've got uses and
sources of resources.

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:02.700
You've got your wealth with
interest today, and the wage

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.900
if you're a worker.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.010
And you could either
eat it or save it.

01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:10.880
Now this p is because capital
is denominated in units

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.780
of the manufacturing good.

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.350
So we've got a price, not just
a wage and an interest rate,

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:16.490
to worry about.

01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:22.590
If you're an entrepreneur, it
looks a lot more complicated.

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:26.270
But actually, this is the
key financing constraint.

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:30.710
So your capital can be
higher than your wealth.

01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:36.510
But it's limited, and I'll show
you where it's coming from.

01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:39.890
So otherwise, this is
like that LEB thing.

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:41.570
You've got profits,
and then if you're

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.360
in the intermediated sector,
you have this return on wealth.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:52.170
Basically they could have
done it many, many ways.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:56.250
They just basically say, you
can run off with the capital.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.960
So the idea is you borrow.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.510
You don't have to repay,
but you pay for it.

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:02.970
You lose the collateral,
which is the wealth you had

01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:04.980
squirreled away in the bank.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:11.380
And then from then on,
you're on your own.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.710
So they get of this
autarchy thing,

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:19.900
and the borrowing size is
limited by the temptation

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.000
to run off into autarchy,
despite the loss of wealth,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.850
because you get to keep that k.

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:28.490
But you do have to pay
workers, for some reason.

01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:30.560
Never quite sure
why they did that.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.100
OK.

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:39.180
So then what they
have to do is compute

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:45.217
the stationary equilibrium,
which is basically a mapping.

01:21:45.217 --> 01:21:47.550
You've got all these many
people with different wealths,

01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:49.890
all these many people
with different talents,

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:53.430
and you get this mapping
till it settles down.

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.800
That's what a
stationary steady state

01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:00.170
means, that those
histograms settle down.

01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:03.160
And at the steady state, you'll
get interest rates and so on.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.800
So they start
grabbing parameters

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.320
to match firm size
distributions.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.250
They aggregate up.

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:18.570
They have the lazy
entrepreneurs who

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.930
aren't so talented versus the
poor guys who are talented

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.820
but have very low wealth.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:26.160
And that's what's creating
the credit friction.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.320
We've talked about that.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.850
And then they try to match.

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:39.310
Now again, is this bragging
rights, or is it a sad story?

01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:41.710
So you can decide here.

01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:44.950
Basically, these
diamonds, they're

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:50.380
calibrated predictions of
capital output, TFP, and worker

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.660
as you vary across countries.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:59.010
And the data are all down here,
in many of these instances.

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.810
So clearly a lot more to do.

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.270
But up to the point
that they wrote this,

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.440
no one had done anything
like this before.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.250
So I think I'll
just skip the rest

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.280
because I want to end on time.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.440
So thank you.

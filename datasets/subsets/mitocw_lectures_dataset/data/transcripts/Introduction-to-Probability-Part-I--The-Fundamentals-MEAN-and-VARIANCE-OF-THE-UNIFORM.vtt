00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.890
As an example of a mean-variance
calculation, we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.520
will now consider the continuous
uniform random

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.610
variable which we have
introduced a little earlier.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.600
This is the continuous analog
of the discrete uniform, for

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.500
which we have already seen
formulas for the corresponding

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.800
mean and variance.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.280
So let us now calculate the mean
or expected value for the

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.090
continuous case.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.660
The mean is defined as an
integral that ranges over the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.170
entire real line.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.100
On the other hand, we recognize
that the density is

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.210
equal to 0 outside the interval
from a to b, and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.740
therefore, there is going to
be no contribution to the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.940
integral from those x's
outside that interval.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.460
This means that we can integrate
just over the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.290
interval from a to b.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.890
And inside that interval, the
value of the density is 1

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.110
over b minus a.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.270
We can carry out this
integration and find an answer

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.360
equal to a plus b over 2, which,
interestingly, also

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.080
happens to be the same as
in the discrete case.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.200
In fact, we could find this
answer without having to run

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.789
this integration.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.060
We could just recognize that
this PDF is symmetric around

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.030
the midpoint of the interval,
and the midpoint is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.630
a plus b over 2.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.340
We now continue with what is
involved in the calculation of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.310
the expected value of the square
of the random variable.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.620
Using the expected value rule,
this is the integral of x

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.720
squared times the density, but
because of the same argument

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.490
as before, we only need to
integrate from a to b.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.360
We can evaluate this integral,
and the answer turns out to be

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.479
1 over (b minus a) times
(b cube over 3

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.010
minus a cube over 3).

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.690
The reason why these cubic
terms appear is that the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.440
integral of the x square
function is x

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
cube divided by 3.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.620
Now that we have this quantity
available, we're ready to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.829
calculate the variance using
this alternative formula,

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.650
which, as we have often
discussed, usually provides us

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
a quicker way to carry
out the calculation.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.930
We take this term,
insert it here.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.270
We take the square of this
term, insert it here.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.610
Carry out some algebra, and
eventually we find an answer

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.490
which is equal to b minus
a squared over 12.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.140
And this is the formula for
the variance of a uniform

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.650
random variable.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.550
We can take the square root of
this expression to find the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.750
standard deviation, and the
standard deviation is going to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.820
be b minus a divided by
the square root of 12.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.830
A few observations.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.350
First, the formula looks quite
similar to the formula for the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.040
variance that we had in the
discrete case, except that in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.579
the discrete case, we
have this extra

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.440
additive factor of 2.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.500
More interestingly, and perhaps
more important, is

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.000
that the standard deviation is
proportional to the width of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.370
this uniform.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.420
The wider it is, the
larger the standard

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.860
deviation will be.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.100
And this conforms to our
intuition that the standard

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660
deviation captures the width of
a particular distribution.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.190
And the variance, of course,
becomes larger when

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.710
the width is larger.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.540
And as far as the variance is
concerned, it increases with

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.670
the square of the length of
the interval over which we

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.920
have our distribution.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.400
PROFESSOR: So far in our
discussion of probability,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.210
we've focused our attention
on the probability

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.220
that some kind of event
occurs-- the probability you

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.600
win the Monty Hall game,
the probability that you get

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.870
a heads when you flip a
coin, the probability we all

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.570
have different birthdays in
the room-- that kind of thing.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.760
In each case, the event
happens or it doesn't.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.630
It's a zero-one kind of thing.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.710
For the rest of
the course, we're

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
going to start talking about
more complicated situations.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.840
Instead of talking
about zero-one events,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.890
like winning or
losing, we're going

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.610
to start talking about
how much you win.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.926
Instead of talking
about whether or not

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:08.970
you get a heads in
a coin flip, we're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.930
going to talk about
flipping lots of coins

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.080
and asking how many
heads did you get?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.420
Now, this involves the
notion of a random variable

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
to count how much or how
many in a random situation.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.250
And actually, the
name is sort of weird.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.650
It's not a variable at all.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.080
In fact, a random variable
is a function from the sample

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.190
space to the real numbers.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:56.220
See random variable R is a
function R from the sample

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.512
space to the reals.

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.470
So this is the random
variable, and we'll often

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.040
denote that by rv.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.980
This is the sample space
of all possible outcomes.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.460
And this is just the reals.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.600
All right, so in other
words, a random variable

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.150
is just a way of
assigning a real number

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.440
to each possible outcome.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.085
For example, say that
we toss three coins.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.080
We could let R equal the number
of heads among the three coins.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.040
And R is thus a random variable.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.920
For example, for the outcome
where the first coin is heads,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.050
the second is tails,
and the third is heads,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.610
R would be the real
number 2, indicating I

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.310
got two heads in that outcome.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.300
We could also define another
value called M, which we'll say

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:16.680
is 1 if all three coins match,
if they're all the same,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.987
and 0 otherwise, if
they're not all the same.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.780
For example, M on the outcome
heads, heads, tails is 0.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.190
M on the outcome
tails, tails, tails

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.120
would be 1, because
they all are the same.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.120
Is M a random variable?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.370
Yeah, it assigns a value, a
real number, to every outcome.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.110
And that value is
either 0 or 1, depending

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.980
on if all the coins match.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.870
In fact, it's a very special
kind of random variable

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.520
that's called an indicator
random variable, also

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.820
known as Bernoulli or
characteristic random variable,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.270
because it's zero-one.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:21.209
An indicator also
known as a Bernoulli

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:35.890
or characteristic
random variable,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:44.130
is a random variable whose
range or possible values

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.910
is just 0 and 1.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.030
So it's a random variable
where the real numbers

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.140
are 0, 1 that you assign
to every sample point.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.920
And it's called a characteristic
or indicator random variable

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.660
because it indicates
which sample points have

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.430
a certain property.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.480
In this case, all the
coins were the same.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.310
Or it indicates
that a sample point

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.110
has a certain
characteristic, which

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.742
is why it's called a
characteristic random variable.

00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:13.200
And we're going to
be talking a lot

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.800
about these kinds
of random variables

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.760
over the next couple of weeks.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440
Now, in general, a random
variable is equivalent to,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.470
or it can define a partition
on the sample space.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.710
For an indicator
random variable,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.220
it defines a partition
with two blocks.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.470
For example, say we look at the
sample space with three coin

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.080
tosses there.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.180
There's eight outcomes.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.400
There's heads, heads,
heads; heads, tails, heads;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.556
heads, heads, tails;
tail, heads, heads;

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:56.835
and the reverse of those.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.180
This is the sample space
when I toss three coins.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.940
There's eight possible outcomes.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.845
The random variable M
defines this partition.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.790
Up top, you have M equals 1, and
down below you have M equals 0.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.450
Because these are the outcomes
where all the coins match.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.700
These are the ones that don't.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.775
The random variable R defines
a different partition.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.320
In that case, the
partition has four blocks.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.860
Here is R equals 0, no heads.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.660
This is R equals 1, to one head.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.340
R equals 2, and R equals 3.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.750
So a random variable just sort
of organizes your sample space,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.450
partitions it into
blocks, defined

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.560
by all the elements
in the block,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.976
the outcomes in the
block have the same value

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:06.975
for the random variable.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.000
And, in fact, every
block is really an event.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.040
In particular, we
can say that, if you

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.530
look at the outcomes for
which the random variable

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.830
on that outcome
equals some value x,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.160
this is simply the
event that R equals x.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.900
The random variable is x.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.490
And, of course, an event is just
a subset of the sample space.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.345
It's a collection of outcomes
that define the event.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.870
And since we know we could talk
about probabilities of events,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.900
we can now say things like this.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.610
We can say the probability
that a random variable equals

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.950
x is simply the probability
of that event happening, which

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:03.890
is the sum over all outcomes
for which the random variable

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.850
equals x for that outcome,
summing its probability.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.060
So the probability that the
random variable equals a value

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.500
is the sum of the probabilities
of the sample points

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500
for which R has that value.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.250
All right, this is all
really basic stuff,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.200
but important to get down.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.960
So, for example,
what's the probability

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.372
that R equals 2 in our
case with the three coins?

00:08:31.372 --> 00:08:35.090
You flip three coins-- let's say
the coins are fair and mutually

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.860
independent.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.720
We probably need to know that.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.675
What is the
probability R equals 2?

00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:42.950
AUDIENCE: 3/8?

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.780
PROFESSOR: 3/8, because you've
got three outcomes, each

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.050
with a probability 1/8.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.590
All right, so by
this definition, that

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.640
would be the same as the
probability of heads, heads,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.240
tails; heads, tails,
heads; tails, heads,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.160
heads; that's 3/8.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.660
What's the probability
that M equals 1?

00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:19.300
What's the probability
that M equals 1?

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.050
M is 1 if all the coins match.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.360
1/4 because you've got two
cases there-- heads, heads,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.720
heads-- whoops--
or tails, tails,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.982
tails; and that's 2/8, or 1/4.

00:09:36.982 --> 00:09:39.840
Now we can also talk
about the probability

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.930
that a random variable
is in some range.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.180
For example, I could ask,
what's the probability

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.925
that R is at least 2?

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:58.340
All right, that would mean the
sum i equals 2 to infinity,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.230
the probability R equals i.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.035
And what is that?

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.150
What's the probability?

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.740
R is at least 2.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.480
1/2.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.469
It's the probability
that R equals 2,

00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:14.010
plus the probability
that R equals 3.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.840
There's four outcomes there,
each with 1/8, so that's 1/2.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.030
And finally, we can talk
about the probability

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.770
that R is in some set of values.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:34.670
So we could say, for
example, for any subset

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.830
of the real numbers, we
define the probability

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:44.100
that R attains a value
in that set is simply

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.660
the sum over all possible
values in the set,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.570
that the probability
R equals that value.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.170
So we could ask, what's the
probability that, say, we

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.950
take A being the set 1, 3.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.120
I could ask for
the probability R

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.380
is A when it's 1, 3, which is
the same as the probability

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.220
R is odd.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.210
Because Our could
only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:24.494
What's the probability R
is odd in this example?

00:11:24.494 --> 00:11:26.410
Flip three coins, we're
asking the probability

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.240
you get an odd number of
heads-- one or three heads.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.650
1/2.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:40.057
Again, you've got four sample
points-- here and there.

00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:40.640
So that's 1/2.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.125
All right, any questions
about the definition?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.130
All right, now, we're only
going to worry about the case

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.100
when random variables
are discrete.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.940
Namely, there's a
finite number of values.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.190
If you have continuous random
variables, which they'll

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.550
deal with in other
courses, instead

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.010
of doing sums and
stuff like that,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.260
you're working with integrals.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.840
But for this course, it's
going to be all countable sets,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.770
and usually often finite sets.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.300
Now, conditional probability
carries over very nicely

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.690
to random variables as well.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.160
For example, we could
write down the probability

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.974
that R equals 2 given that M
equals 1, where R and M are

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:36.140
the same random variables
we've been looking at when

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.340
you flip the three coins.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.830
What is that probability?

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.960
0, the probability of getting
exactly two heads when they're

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.210
all the same, can't happen.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.990
It's 0.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.590
You can either have
three heads or no heads.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.380
So that's 0.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.852
The notion of independence
also carries over

00:12:57.852 --> 00:12:59.310
to random variables,
but you've got

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.530
to be a little careful here.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:12.870
Two random variables,
R1 and R2, are

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:26.070
said to be independent if-- and
this is a little complicated--

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:31.392
for all possible
values, x1 and x2

00:13:31.392 --> 00:13:40.290
in the real numbers, the
probability that R1 is x1,

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:46.580
given that R2 is x2, is the
same as the probability of R1

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.910
equals x1 not knowing
anything about R2.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.610
Or there's a special case
when this can't happen.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.190
Namely, the probability
that R2 equals x2 is 0.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.830
So, for two random
variables to be independent,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.720
it needs to be the case that,
no matter what happens out here

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.910
with R2, and whatever
you know about it,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.740
it can't influence
the probability for R1

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.030
to equal anything.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:27.790
So no value of R2
influences any value of R1.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.180
So it's the strongest possible
thing with independence

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.946
for it to apply to
random variables.

00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:36.570
And there's an
equivalent definition,

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.260
and we're going to use these
interchangeably, just as there

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.010
were two definitions for
independence of events,

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.840
there's the product for them.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.890
So the equivalent
definitions says

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:55.500
for all x1 and x2 in the
real numbers, the probability

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:02.550
that R1 equals x1 and
R2 equals x2 is simply

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.680
the product of
those probabilities.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:12.410
Probability R1 equals x1 times
the probability R2 equals x2.

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.820
And you don't have to
worry about that case

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.980
where R2 being x2 is 0.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.490
So we can use both of those
as definitions of independence

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.550
of random variables.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.430
All right, so let's
see an example.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.500
We've got R and M. We've talked
about two random variables.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.320
Are they independent
random variables?

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.790
M is the indicated
random variable

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.630
for all the coins matching.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.180
R is the random variable
that tells us how many heads

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.210
there were in three coins.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.790
Are they independent?

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.510
AUDIENCE: No.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.024
PROFESSOR: No, why not?

00:15:54.024 --> 00:15:57.293
AUDIENCE: Because information
with what one is narrows down

00:15:57.293 --> 00:15:57.934
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:57.934 --> 00:15:59.100
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.560
Information about
what one value is

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.210
influences the probability
that the other guy

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.240
has a certain value.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.030
In particular, we can
find a case of x1 and x2

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.020
where this fails.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.910
One case would be
the probability

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:21.036
of what we've already done,
that R equals 2 and M equals 1.

00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:23.930
What was this probability?

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.650
0.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.780
If everything matches,
you can't have two heads.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.110
That's 0.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.220
That does not equal
the probability

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.580
of two heads times the
probability they all match.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.550
Because this probability,
two heads is 3/8,

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.045
probability they
all match is 1/4.

00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:47.510
And 3/8 times a 1/4 is not 0.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.730
So R and M are not independent.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.560
OK, now in general to
show two random variables

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.070
are not independent,
all you gotta

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:08.180
do is find one pair of [? out ?]
values for which there's

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.700
dependence.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.060
To show their
independent, you've

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.390
got to deal with all
possible pairs of values.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.480
So it's harder show
independence in general.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.588
All right, let's
do another example,

00:17:24.588 --> 00:17:26.569
get a little practice with this.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:51.730
Say we have two fair independent
six-sided die, normal dice.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.590
And the outcome of
the first one is D1,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.710
and the outcome of
the second roll is D2.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:04.170
And by independent, I mean here
that knowing any information

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.040
about what the second
die is does not

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.020
give you any change
in your probability

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.690
that the first
die has any value.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.500
And now we define
another value, S,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.825
to be D1 plus D2,
the sum of the dice.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.930
Is S a random variable?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.190
Yeah, for any outcome-- an
outcome being a pair of dice

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.026
values-- it maps that
outcome to a real number,

00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:41.700
a number between 2 and 12, OK?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.560
Let's do another one.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:53.870
Let's let T be 1 if S is 7,
namely the sum of the dice

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.200
is 7, and 0 otherwise.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.340
T is also a random variable.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.030
In fact, what kind is it?

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.550
Yeah, indicator,
characteristic, whatever.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.830
It's telling you if the sum
of the dice is 7 or not.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.300
All right, now, there's
four random variables here.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.440
Each die, which we
already have told you,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.370
we're assuming are independent.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.830
The sum and the indicator
if the sum is 7.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.990
All right, what about
these two values?

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.170
Are D1, the first die,
and the sum independent?

00:19:41.603 --> 00:19:43.998
AUDIENCE: No?

00:19:43.998 --> 00:19:45.440
No?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.850
PROFESSOR: No,
intuitively they're not.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.020
Because if I know something
about the first die,

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.710
I probably know
something about the sum.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.110
Now to really nail
that down, you've

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.670
got to give me a
value for this, which

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.419
influences the probability
that obtains some value, right?

00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:09.710
That's how you would convince
me that, in fact, they're

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.209
dependent.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.870
Can anybody give
me a value for this

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.770
that changes the probability
this equals something?

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.250
AUDIENCE: Guess?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.330
If it's like 1, then
[INAUDIBLE] has to be 6.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:32.170
PROFESSOR: If this is
1, what value of this

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.028
could be influenced?

00:20:35.028 --> 00:20:39.930
AUDIENCE: You know that in order
for-- the only set of values

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.348
S can take now, it can only
be from 1 to-- from 2 to 7.

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:45.306
PROFESSOR: From 2 to 7.

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:49.230
In particular now,
this can't be 12.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.570
So what I could do is say
the probability that S

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:58.780
equals 12 and the first die
was 1, what's that probability?

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.280
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.300
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.980
And that does not
equal the probability

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.380
S is 12 times the probability
the first die was 1.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.690
Or we could plug it into
the other definition.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.290
The probability that S equals
12 given the first die is 1

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.440
is not equal to the
probability S equals 12.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.510
And, in fact, probability
the first die is 1 is not 0.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.750
So either definition,
of course, works

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.630
to show that they are dependent.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.350
So S and D1 are dependent.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.430
All you need is
one possible pair

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.360
of values to show dependence.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.660
That's usually easy to do.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:52.700
All right, what about
D1, the first die, and T,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.695
the indicator for getting a 7?

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.310
Are D1 and T independent
random variables?

00:22:05.815 --> 00:22:08.860
All right, somebody's
shaking their head no.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.430
They seem to be dependent
because knowing the first die

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.660
seems like it should tell you
something about the probability

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.930
of getting a 7 for the sum.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.140
That's a good first intuition.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.770
In fact, you always
want to assume

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.070
things are dependent unless you
convince yourself otherwise.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.770
It's always a good rule.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.200
Now, in fact, in this
case, it is independent.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.910
The probability of getting
a 7 is not, it turns out,

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.540
influenced by the first die.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.380
Anything else would
be, but 7 is not.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.827
Let's see why that is.

00:22:45.827 --> 00:22:47.660
And to do that, we'd
actually have to check,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.700
I think, 12 cases, all
possible values for D1 and T,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.710
but you'll get the
idea pretty quick.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.620
The probability that T
equals 1, namely you got a 7,

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.970
given that D1 equals 1.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.180
What's that?

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.965
The probability of getting 7
for the sum given your first die

00:23:06.965 --> 00:23:08.760
is a 1, what's that probability?

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.540
AUDIENCE: 1/6?

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.730
PROFESSOR: 1/6, because the
second one better be a 6.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:19.500
All right, and what's the
probability T equals 1?

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.425
What's the probability
of rolling a 7?

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.096
Yeah?

00:23:26.096 --> 00:23:27.240
AUDIENCE: 6/36.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.670
PROFESSOR: 6/36.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.160
There's six ways to do it.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.880
1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, 4
and 3, 5 and 2, and 6 and 1,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.370
out of 36 possibilities
equally likely.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.670
So that worked here.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.240
Now probability of getting
a 7 given the second

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.605
die-- sorry-- the
first die is a 2.

00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:50.105
What's that?

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.310
Probability of getting a 7 given
that your first die is a 2.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.720
1/6, because you've got to
have the second die be a 5,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.670
and that happens 1/6.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.740
And that equals the right thing.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.800
In fact, I can
keep on going here.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:18.560
Probability T equals 1,
given D1 is anything, 6.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.450
Well, for every
value of D1, there's

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.690
exactly one value of
D2 that adds to a 7.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:31.060
So it's still 1/6, which is
the probability of getting

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.770
the 7 in the first place.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.700
Now we've also got to check
the probability T equals 0,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.910
given all these cases for D1.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.340
D1 equals 1.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:43.850
What's this?

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.970
The probability of not getting
a 7 given the first die is a 1.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.875
What's that?

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:50.780
AUDIENCE: 5/6.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.820
PROFESSOR: 5/6, it's the
opposite of this case.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.460
They pair up.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.300
That's got to be 5/6,
and that is, of course,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.960
the probability of T equals 0.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.810
And the same is true for
all the other five cases.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:14.200
The probability T equals
0 given any value of D

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.910
is 5/6, which equals, the
probability T equals 0.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.860
So we check all
possible values of T1

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.710
and all possible ways of
D1, and lo and behold,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.050
it works every time.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.840
So knowing the
first die does not

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.630
change the probability
of getting a 7.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.595
Would it change the
probability of getting a 6?

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.040
Yeah, because if the
first die were a 6,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.960
you know you're going
to get more than a 6.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.000
So it just holds
true because I picked

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.220
it to be an indicator for 7.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.780
Any questions about that?

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.900
So if you're ever asked to
show things are independent,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.424
you've got to go
through all the cases.

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.090
If you're asked to
show their dependent,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.830
just find one case that
blows it up, and you're done.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.090
OK, you can also talk
about independence

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.466
for many random variables.

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:14.340
And you have a notion
of mutual independence.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.080
And this is a little hairy.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.090
It's a natural thing.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:54.400
R1, R2, up to Rn are mutually
independent if for all

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.430
the values of all the random
variables, so x1, x2, xn.

00:27:03.941 --> 00:27:06.190
And we're going to give the
product form, because it's

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.650
the simpler way to do it here.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:19.170
The probability that R1 is
x1, and R2 is x2, and Rn is xn

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.450
equals the product of the
individual probabilities.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.420
It's the natural generalization
for two variables.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.950
And there's also
the equivalent form

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.665
in conditional probabilities,
but that's a little harrier

00:27:40.665 --> 00:27:43.710
to write down, and we
generally don't work with that.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.340
Any questions about
mutual independence?

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.227
Yeah.

00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:56.143
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:04.173 --> 00:28:05.664
PROFESSOR: So any subset what?

00:28:05.664 --> 00:28:06.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.720
PROFESSOR: Yes, in
the conditional form

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.770
you check any subset,
here you don't have

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:16.940
to worry about the subsets.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.550
You take any possible
value for all of them,

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.290
so there's no subset
notation in this version,

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.706
so you can do without it.

00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:27.080
That would be
equivalent, there's

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.371
another form where you look
at all the possible subsets

00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.030
as well, and
conditioning on that.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.932
But this is good enough,
and this is probably

00:28:32.932 --> 00:28:34.890
the simplest way to do
the mutual independence,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.150
is like this.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.850
So every variable
is included here.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.950
And that will imply the
same thing for any subset.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.380
You don't have to check
every subset here.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.620
And then you could do
that by just summing

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.560
over Rn being everything,
and that cancels away

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.016
to get rid of items.

00:28:53.016 --> 00:28:54.640
But you don't have
to worry about that.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.540
OK, so we're going to
change gears a little bit

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.990
now, and talk about the
probability distribution

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.600
function, which is just
a way a sort of writing

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.860
down or characterizing the
probabilities associated

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.625
with each value being attained.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:33.690
So given a random variable,
R, the probability

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:53.360
also known as the point,
distribution function,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:01.580
also denoted pdf, probability
distribution function, for R

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.700
is, well, it's very simple.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.940
It's just the function
f of x, which equals

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.320
the probability that R is x.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.940
Very simple.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.170
But now we're characterizing
it as a function.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.320
And there's also a notion of
the cumulative distribution

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.830
function, which is going to
be the probability that R

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.130
is less than or equal to x.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.231
Let's write that down.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:31:12.500
The cumulative
distribution function F

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:19.820
for random variable
R is simply f

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:25.840
of x is the probability that
R is at most x, which is just

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.730
the sum over all y
less than or equal to x

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.510
the probability R equals y.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.930
So the distribution functions
characterize the probability

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.560
a random variable
takes on any value,

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.400
and there's certain common ones
that just come up all the time.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.190
And so people have
done a lot of analysis

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.990
about them because they
occur so frequently.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.110
And we're going to talk
about three of them today.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.860
The first is really
simple, and that

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.000
is the Bernoulli
random variable,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.820
or indicator random variable.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:29.520
All right, so for an indicator
random variable, f 0 is p,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:36.290
and f 1 is 1 minus p, for sum p.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.817
The probability could be half,
if you're flipping a coin.

00:32:38.817 --> 00:32:41.400
The probability of heads could
be a half, probability of tails

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.066
would be a half.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:45.360
It's just two values, 0 and 1.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.770
And then the cumulative
function is very simple.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.130
F 0 is p, big F of 1 is 1.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.225
So that is about as simple
of functions as you can get.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.390
The next simplest,
and also very common,

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.370
is called a uniform
random variable.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.380
Let's define that.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:32.610
For a uniform random
variable-- and we

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.000
have to define what
it's defined on--

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.900
on say the integers from 1 to n,
every value is equally likely.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.600
All the integers from 1 to n
are equally likely to occur.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:51.470
And so in this case, n is a
parameter of the function.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.750
fn of K is simply 1/n.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.860
Each integer from 1 to
n is equally likely.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.260
So it's 1 and n.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.360
All right, what is the
cumulative distribution

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.920
function for this?

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.989
What is big F of n
of K for the uniform?

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.350
The probability that
the random variable

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.518
takes a value that's at most K?

00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:24.449
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.199
PROFESSOR: Close, K/n.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.139
And you could
think of K being 1.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.469
You have a least the
1 over n probability.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.290
So you have K chances.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:40.159
It could be 1, 2, 3, 4 up
to K, each has a 1/n chance.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.380
Because we've got,
the definition

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.469
is less than or
equal, not less than.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.250
Uniform distributions
come up all the time,

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:59.460
rolling a fair die is uniform
on 1 through 6 for values.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.560
If I pick a random student
in the class, the chance

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.940
I pick you is 1 in
the size of the class.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.520
We have uniform sample spaces.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.300
Each outcome occurs
equally likely.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.340
All right, any
questions about uniform?

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.552
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:18.552 --> 00:35:20.260
OK, so while we're
talking about uniform,

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.970
I want to play a
game, whose optimal

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.980
strategy is going to
turn out to be related

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.120
to uniform distributions.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.750
Now the game works as follows.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.890
I'm going to have
two envelopes here.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.400
And inside each envelope,
I've written a number.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.060
And the number in
this case is a number

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.155
between 0 and 100 inclusive.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.090
It's not a random number,
because I wrote it,

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.600
and maybe I'm not
such a nice guy.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.230
I might have picked nasty
numbers to write here.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.910
They are different, though.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.060
The numbers are different
in the envelopes.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.260
Now I'm going to pick a
volunteer from the class,

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.630
and their job is to pick
the envelope with the bigger

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.200
number.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.910
And if they get the one
with the bigger number,

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.520
then they get one of
these guys for ice cream.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.910
And if they don't get the
one with the bigger number,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.340
they get the nerd
pride pocket protector.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.030
Now, since you don't know
which number I put in which,

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:35.520
50-50 if you get the prize,
the $10 gift certificate.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.980
So to give you a
little bit of an edge,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.060
I'm going to let you
open one of the envelopes

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.320
and see what number's there.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.780
Then you have to decide, do
you want the number you got,

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.210
or do you want the
other envelope?

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.330
OK?

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.850
Is the game clear,
what we're going to do?

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.740
OK, so need a couple
of volunteers.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.950
We're going to do it twice.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.590
All right, somebody way
in the back up there.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.520
Any other volunteers?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.520
All right, come on down.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.017
Oh, you've already
played before.

00:37:05.017 --> 00:37:07.190
(LAUGHTER) You already got.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:12.510
Who hasn't played before, wants
to-- all right, come on up.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.641
Now you want to be thinking
about, boy, is there a strategy

00:37:15.641 --> 00:37:16.140
here?

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.660
Or is this just
dumb luck, 50-50?

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.965
OK, what's your name?

00:37:21.965 --> 00:37:22.590
AUDIENCE: Sean.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.410
PROFESSOR: Sean.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.700
All right, I got
two envelopes, Sean.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.170
They are numbers
between 0 and 100.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:33.707
And you can pick one, and
we'll reveal the number,

00:37:33.707 --> 00:37:34.540
and then you decide.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.081
Do you want the number you got,
or do you want the other one?

00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:39.510
The goal is to get
the bigger number.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.650
So take one and open it.

00:37:48.105 --> 00:37:49.099
What did you get?

00:37:49.099 --> 00:37:50.587
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:37:50.587 --> 00:37:51.087
He got

00:37:51.087 --> 00:37:52.590
PROFESSOR: A 6.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:56.070
The numbers go from 0 to 100.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.880
What do you think
Sean should do?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.202
AUDIENCE: Switch.

00:37:59.202 --> 00:37:59.701
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.289
PROFESSOR: What do you
think you should do?

00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:05.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.650
AUDIENCE: They've got
to check the other one.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.085
PROFESSOR: No, no, you
can't look at the other one.

00:38:13.085 --> 00:38:14.710
And unfortunately,
you're going to play

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.850
with different envelopes.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.240
What should you do?

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.410
6, there's a lot of numbers
bigger than 6, Sean.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.920
But they might not
be in that envelope.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.730
Might be a 0 in that envelope.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.900
AUDIENCE: That would suck.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.110
AUDIENCE: I'll stay.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.220
PROFESSOR: You're
going to stay with 6?

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.930
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.680
PROFESSOR: All
right, he picked 6.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.263
What do you think
he should have done?

00:38:34.263 --> 00:38:36.350
How many people think
he should have switched?

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.210
Ooh, Sean.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.010
How many people
like Sean's choice?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.700
Not so good.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.033
All right, let's see if you won.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.855
Here we go.

00:38:46.855 --> 00:38:48.550
5.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.560
Sean wins the ice cream.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.150
Good work.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:56.147
Now Sean, what was
your thinking here?

00:38:56.147 --> 00:38:58.582
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:03.452
in the other envelope,
knowing that 6 doesn't tell me

00:39:03.452 --> 00:39:05.887
anything about what's
in the other one,

00:39:05.887 --> 00:39:07.835
so my chances of
seeing [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.900
PROFESSOR: Totally 50-50.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.130
How many people
buy that argument?

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.756
It's 50-50.

00:39:15.756 --> 00:39:17.880
He really has no idea what's
in the other envelope.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.160
How many people think
there's a better way?

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.785
Not too many.

00:39:21.785 --> 00:39:23.410
All right, we're
going to try it again.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.170
Well done.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.304
I've got different
envelopes here.

00:39:26.304 --> 00:39:27.470
And tell me your name again?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.095
AUDIENCE: Drew.

00:39:28.095 --> 00:39:29.510
PROFESSOR: Drew, OK Drew.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.230
Two envelopes.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.136
Which one would
you like to open?

00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:34.510
AUDIENCE: They're
both labeled B.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.430
PROFESSOR: They're both labeled
B. That won't help you there.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.430
All right, he's got one.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.570
Let's see what you got.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.620
92.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.520
Oh my goodness, and
we've seen what 5 and 6.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.830
What are you going to do?

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.300
92.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.540
What should he do, guys?

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.174
AUDIENCE: Stay.

00:39:59.174 --> 00:39:59.840
PROFESSOR: Stay.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.780
Oh he's got a big number there.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.160
You're going to switch?

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.670
You're giving up a 92?

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.480
Ooh, you're sure?

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.410
You don't want the 92?

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.641
How many people think
Drew is going to win?

00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:16.890
AUDIENCE: He's trying to lose.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.250
PROFESSOR: A couple people.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.909
Let's see.

00:40:20.909 --> 00:40:21.450
AUDIENCE: 91.

00:40:24.366 --> 00:40:26.320
It's either 91 or 93.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.870
PROFESSOR: 93, how did you
know there was a bigger number?

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.229
Wow, very good.

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:31.770
There you go.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.500
What was your strategy?

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.580
AUDIENCE: I figured you'd
probably pick them within 1.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.068
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:38.984
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:52.452
PROFESSOR: Actually, they're
both [INAUDIBLE] to 93.

00:40:52.452 --> 00:40:54.350
Would you still switch?

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.600
PROFESSOR: Still switch.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.480
Hmm.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.518
All right, so is it 50-50 then?

00:41:00.518 --> 00:41:03.410
Because you see a 92 a 93,
you're switching either way.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.635
PROFESSOR: 50-50.

00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:07.670
All right, how many
people still like 50-50?

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.880
He can't beat 50-50 here.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.380
Any ideas?

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.840
Can you beat 50-50?

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.796
Yeah.

00:41:13.796 --> 00:41:16.664
AUDIENCE: I just pay
attention to your face.

00:41:16.664 --> 00:41:19.391
PROFESSOR: I guess
I gave it away.

00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:22.300
I think I've lost every bet
so far in the course here,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.320
even on Monty Hall, every time.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.450
So I guess I have a
tell or something here.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.210
Now, in fact, you
can beat 50-50.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.530
The information is helpful.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.835
Now, just to be clear,
are these numbers

00:41:34.835 --> 00:41:37.760
that I wrote down random?

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.490
No.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.100
No, I'm trying
not to give away--

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.180
my ice cream bill is going
through the roof here.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.320
I'm trying to make it hard.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.570
They're very much not random.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.400
There were two
smalls and two bigs.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.086
What is random here?

00:41:51.086 --> 00:41:52.460
AUDIENCE: Which
one he picked is.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.810
PROFESSOR: Which one he saw,
that's 50-50, effectively.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.920
So that's random there.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.810
Now his strategy could also
be random, but it wasn't.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.710
His strategy was, if
he sees a big number,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.320
he's swapping, which is odd.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.914
Most people see the big
number, they want to keep it.

00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:11.330
You know, I'd have
done well today

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.621
if I had a really big number
and a really small number,

00:42:13.621 --> 00:42:15.470
because then I would
have won both times.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.530
OK, so to see why there might
be a winning strategy, or better

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.510
than 50-50, imagine
that I had been nice

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.020
and put a very small
number in one envelope

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.640
and a very big number
of the other envelope.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.520
Say I had a 5 in one
and a 92 in the other.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.230
Can you win then,
if you know that?

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.280
OK, how do you win if
you know there's one less

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.100
than 10 and one bigger than 90?

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.247
Yeah?

00:42:47.247 --> 00:42:49.330
AUDIENCE: If you get the
one less than 10, switch.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:50.705
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
and you're going

00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:52.820
to win with what probability?

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.675
1.

00:42:53.675 --> 00:42:55.910
It's a certainty.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:03.700
All right, well, but
I'm not that nice, say.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.190
Say, though, there
is a threshold

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:10.720
x, such that one of the
numbers is less than x,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.510
and one is bigger than
x, and you know x.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.330
Can you win now?

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.750
Say you know that one number
is less than 47 and 1/2,

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.700
and one is bigger
than 47 and 1/2.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.380
Can you win?

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.030
Yeah, because if you get the
one less than 47 and 1/2,

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.947
you switch.

00:43:31.947 --> 00:43:33.030
And otherwise you'll stay.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.240
So again, you win
with certainty.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.730
All right, that's good.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.130
Is there always such an x?

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.810
You may not know it, but
is there always such an x?

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.840
Yeah, because the
numbers are different.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.080
Just pick up a real
number in between them.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.110
You know, with 92 and
93, there's 92 and 1/2,

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.670
is such an x.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.470
Now the only problem
is you don't know it.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.920
And there's no way to
figure it out that's

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.580
within the rules of the game.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.970
Now in life, if you
don't know something,

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.870
and you can't figure it
out, what can you do?

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.670
AUDIENCE: Guess.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.340
PROFESSOR: Guess it.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.080
All right, now this turns out
to be a really good thing to do,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.757
and especially good in a lot
of computer science situations.

00:44:21.757 --> 00:44:23.590
If you don't know it,
and you can't know it,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.210
well you could try to guess
and you might be right.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:31.570
Now, if you guess x
and you are right,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.060
what's your
probability of winning?

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.970
1.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.220
If you don't guess x, what's
your probability of winning?

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.100
Say you guess wrong, but
you follow the rule that

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.100
if it's less than what
you guessed, you swap it,

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.560
otherwise you don't.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.370
What's your probability
of winning that?

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:51.960
P?

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.490
Well, yeah, what's P?

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:58.840
It's a nice value of P.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.900
You know, say you
guessed-- well,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.719
say you weren't paying
attention and you guessed 200.

00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:07.010
And your rule is, if you're
less than what you guessed,

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.650
you're less than 200,
you swap, which means

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.040
you're just going to swap.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.690
And you started with a
random one, so what's

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.370
your chance of winning?

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.190
A half.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.670
So if you guessed wrong,
you didn't lose anything.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.580
You still win with
probability a half.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.860
If you guessed right, you
win with probability 1,

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.610
and there's some chance
you guessed right,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.250
so now you've got a
strategy that beats 50-50,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.970
because you guessed.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.040
OK, and this is a whole
field in computer science

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.840
where you get randomized
algorithms, where

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.760
this strategy depends on a
coin flip, on guessing a value.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.360
And it leads to getting
potentially a better outcome.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.260
All right, so let's
prove that now

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.320
and see what the probability
is of winning with the guess

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.468
strategy and what's
a good way to guess.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.780
So we're going to first
formalize our random protocol.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:30.500
All right, so if this
is the winning strategy,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:42.020
well first the envelopes
contain y and z,

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.730
and they're in the
interval 0 to n.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.587
And y is going to
be less than z.

00:46:47.587 --> 00:46:49.170
That's how we're
going to define them.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:53.290
Now you don't know
y and z, but y

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:56.730
is the smaller number in the
envelope, z is the larger.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.230
And in our example, n was 100.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:12.540
Now the player
chooses x randomly,

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:18.800
uniformly among all the
possible half integers.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.230
So he might pick 1/2, he might
pick 1 and 1/2, 2 and 1/2,

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.844
all the way out to n minus 1/2.

00:47:29.844 --> 00:47:32.010
You know, because if the
player picks anything else,

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.500
it's useless.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.590
He won't have a chance to win.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.880
But he might, in
the case of 5 and 6,

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.570
might have picked 5 and 1/2.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.100
And we're going to make our
random guess be equally likely

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.060
among those n values, because
well he doesn't really

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:52.290
know what the numbers are
I put in the envelopes.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.976
If he sees 6, he doesn't
know if it's 5 or it's 7, OK?

00:47:56.976 --> 00:47:59.350
So that's why we're going to
pick them all equally likely

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.058
and it's uniform.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.850
Now the player is hoping
that he picked a value that

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:12.500
splits y and z, OK?

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.329
Because then he's going to win.

00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:17.620
If he picked an x between
the numbers in the envelopes,

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.860
and follows the swap, if he got
the small number less than x,

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:27.050
he's going to win, all right?

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:41.100
Then the player opens a
random envelope, 50-50,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:47.340
to reveal a number r,
which is either y or z,

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.730
but the player doesn't
know which one.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.690
So one of the numbers
gets revealed.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:03.100
And then the last step
is the player swaps

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:08.720
if the number he revealed is
less than the guessed split

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.220
number.

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.400
That's the strategy,
and it's a strategy

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.720
that depends on a random
guess or a random number.

00:49:26.302 --> 00:49:27.760
So let's figure
out the probability

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.060
of winning with that strategy.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.640
And we're going to
use the tree method.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.410
Well, the first branch
in the tree method

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:40.700
is whether or not--
where the guess wound up.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.770
And there's three cases
for how the guess did.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.660
You might have guessed
too low, in which case,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.590
x is less than y,
and y is less than z.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.130
You might have guessed
perfectly, in which case

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:02.570
x is between y and z,
equals not possible.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.840
Or you might have
guessed too high,

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.470
in which case y is less
than z is less than x.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:13.545
All right, so here's low,
here's high, and here's

00:50:13.545 --> 00:50:17.270
an OK guess, a good guess.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:21.920
Now what's the probability
you guessed low, that you

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.130
picked an x less than y?

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:30.140
y is integers, x is
the half integers.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.690
What's the probability
to assign to that chance,

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.925
that you guessed low?

00:50:36.925 --> 00:50:39.547
You could use the value
of y in your answer.

00:50:39.547 --> 00:50:41.630
You don't know y, but we
can write it on the tree.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.686
What if y was 1?

00:50:47.686 --> 00:50:49.185
The smallest number
in the envelopes

00:50:49.185 --> 00:50:54.310
is one, what's the probability
you guessed below 1?

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.950
Not quite 0, one of your
possible end guesses

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.920
would be too low,
namely, a half.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.170
If the smallest number
y were 2, what's

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:13.340
the probability
you guess below 2?

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.070
2/n.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:19.510
And in general, if y
is the smallest value,

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.440
you've got y possible
guesses that it

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.070
would be too low, namely all
the half integers less than y.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.920
So the probability
you guess low is y/n,

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.190
because each one
is 1 in n chance.

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:37.250
And there's y that are too low.

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.070
What's the probability
your guess is good,

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.430
that you split y and z?

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:52.310
z minus y over n, because
they're-- between these

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:56.910
integers, z and y, there's
z minus y half integers.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.792
Each could have been guessed
with probability 1/n.

00:51:59.792 --> 00:52:01.625
And what's the probability
you guessed high?

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:07.560
n minus z over n,
because there's

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.856
n minus g half
integers between z

00:52:11.856 --> 00:52:16.570
and n being the last possible
one, and minus the half there.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:19.620
All right, so we've
got the first branch.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:24.620
Now the next branch
is the revealed value.

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.190
Did you open the smaller
one or the larger one?

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.430
r equals y means you
opened the smaller one.

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:33.300
r equals z means you
saw the bigger one.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.995
All right, if I've gone
down this branch where

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:47.750
I guessed too low, but
I don't know that, yet,

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.880
but say I've guessed
too low, what's

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.120
the probability I opened
the smaller envelope?

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:58.500
One half, because you're just
picking a random envelope

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.870
and opening up.

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.790
So these each happen
with probability a half.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:05.066
And that's true no matter what.

00:53:05.066 --> 00:53:05.940
They're all one half.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:13.370
All right, well, now we
can compute the probability

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.910
of each outcome.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:19.490
This is y/n times
1/2, is y over 2n.

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.920
This is y over 2n also.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.880
This is z minus y over 2n.

00:53:27.742 --> 00:53:31.090
z minus y over 2n.

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:32.910
n minus z over 2n.

00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:42.030
All right, I got all
the sample points.

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.530
I got all the probabilities.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.872
Let's figure out if you win now.

00:53:46.872 --> 00:53:49.080
And to do that, the first
thing we have to figure out

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:49.995
is, do you swap?

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.073
Do you swap here?

00:53:58.627 --> 00:53:59.460
Well, what happened?

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:04.240
I revealed y, which is
bigger than my split value

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.270
x, my guessed value.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.890
And so I am guessing I've
got the biggest value.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.800
So I don't swap.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.850
So there's no swap.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.060
What about here?

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.140
Do I swap here?

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.060
I open z, I saw z.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.890
z is bigger than what I
think the midpoint is,

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:30.740
so I wouldn't swap.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.830
I only guess if
the value I reveal

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.142
is less than my
guessed midpoint.

00:54:37.142 --> 00:54:40.270
If I got a value I see
bigger than my midpoint,

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.256
I think I've got the big one.

00:54:42.256 --> 00:54:45.794
So there's no swap.

00:54:45.794 --> 00:54:46.460
What about here?

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.490
Do I swap here?

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.360
Yes, here I swap
because I open up

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.714
something that's less
than my guessed midpoint,

00:54:52.714 --> 00:54:55.005
so I think I've got the small
one so I'm going to swap.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:54:59.750
What about here?

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.620
Do I swap here?

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.340
No swap, because I
opened up something

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.070
that's bigger than midpoint.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.080
What about here?

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.760
I swap.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.540
And what about here?

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.532
Swap on both of them,
because both of them

00:55:13.532 --> 00:55:17.370
are smaller than my
guessed midpoint.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:21.210
All right, now let's figure
out if you won or you lost.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:26.522
So here I did not swap and I
started with a smaller value.

00:55:26.522 --> 00:55:27.230
So what happened?

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.715
Did I win or lose?

00:55:29.715 --> 00:55:30.850
Lose.

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:33.550
I opened he smaller
value and did not swap.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.970
What happened here?

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.650
I win.

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:40.020
I open the bigger
value and did not swap.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.350
Here what happened?

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:45.950
Win, I opened the small value
when I swapped, that's a win.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:48.330
Here?

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:51.280
I opened the big
value, did not swap.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.590
It's a win.

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:57.590
Here I opened a small value
and swap, that's a win.

00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:02.812
And here I opened a big value
and swap, that's a lose.

00:56:02.812 --> 00:56:05.610
All right, now we can compute
the probability of winning.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.540
The probability of a win is
the sum of these four sample

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:22.110
points-- y over 2n plus
z minus y over 2n plus

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:29.220
z minus y-- whoops-- over
2n plus n minus z over 2n.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:38.830
That equals-- z cancels the
z, and a y cancels the y,

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:44.820
so I've got n, one left,
n left, one z left,

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:49.730
and one negative y left over 2n.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:50.990
And I can simplify that.

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:55.420
N over 2n is 1/2, plus
now what's left over

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.430
is z minus y over 2n.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.960
And we know the z and y are
different by at least 1.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:11.270
So this is at least
1/2 plus 1 over 2n.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:20.280
And so if n is 100, you've got
a 50 and 1/2% chance of winning.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.930
If n is 10, the numbers
are from 0 to 10,

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.220
you've got at least
a 55% chance to win,

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.430
which is pretty high, OK?

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.700
Any questions here?

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.700
You see what's going on?

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.660
So here's the zone
where you guessed right.

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.190
You get the win either way.

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.630
Here you guess low, and it
doesn't make any difference.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:44.940
You're 50-50.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.690
You guessed high and
you're 50-50 again.

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:52.920
So guessing helps.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.500
Any questions about that?

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.532
Yeah.

00:57:55.532 --> 00:57:58.484
AUDIENCE: So aren't you
assuming that-- because you say,

00:57:58.484 --> 00:58:01.436
have a range, a greater
range of numbers,

00:58:01.436 --> 00:58:04.224
that's there's a greater
chance that the number is

00:58:04.224 --> 00:58:07.840
going fall in that range.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.050
PROFESSOR: I was
the nasty guy here.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:12.720
I picked z and y to be
consecutive numbers, which

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.575
minimized your chance of
doing well with this strategy.

00:58:16.575 --> 00:58:18.449
AUDIENCE: Because it
seems like we don't know

00:58:18.449 --> 00:58:19.574
anything about [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:22.746 --> 00:58:24.245
PROFESSOR: The
distribution of what?

00:58:24.245 --> 00:58:26.579
AUDIENCE: Of possible
other numbers

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:27.620
in envelopes [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.000
PROFESSOR: Right, you know
nothing about the distribution

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.120
because there is none.

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.530
There's no randomness there.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:36.900
I picked worst
case numbers here.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.700
AUDIENCE: But it's still
sort of like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.620
If it's 10, you still
have a better chance

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:48.120
to swap than if you
[INAUDIBLE] below that.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.460
PROFESSOR: No.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.320
No, any deterministic
strategy you pick,

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.470
if you don't guess
that random x,

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:58.110
you will not do
better than 50-50.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:01.470
The only way you'd beat
50-50 is to, in your mind,

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:07.390
make a random number 13
and 1/2 and flip if you

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.780
see less than 13 and 1/2.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.640
If you come in with
a strategy that hey,

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.350
10 is a small
number, out of 100,

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:19.380
and so I'm going to
swap if I see a 10,

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.600
well, no, because first it
could be-- I might have done

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.720
9 or 11, either one.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.470
In fact, if I know
that's your strategy,

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:29.530
I'm going to make a 9.

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.620
And then you're
doomed in seeing a 10.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.870
AUDIENCE: So is there a
best way to pick that?

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:38.680
PROFESSOR: Yes, I also
have an optimal strategy.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.350
In fact, there's two
interesting things

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.630
about this game
which we won't prove.

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:46.500
The first thing we'll prove,
we will prove but it's true,

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:50.470
is this is the optimal
strategy for you.

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:53.520
And my optimal
strategy is to pick

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.820
a random value of y
between 0 and n minus 1,

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.217
and then to make z be one more.

01:00:01.217 --> 01:00:03.050
And the way to think
about this, and there's

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.520
whole classes you can
take on game theory,

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.170
is that suppose I do
pick my guys randomly

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:14.900
by picking a random y
uniformly from 0 to n minus 1.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.510
So my smaller number is
anything between 0 and 99,

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:22.550
equally likely, and then the
bigger number's just one more.

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.340
So if I picked 92
for the random one,

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.360
the next one's going to be 93.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.350
If that's my strategy,
even if I tell you that,

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:35.354
you cannot do any better than
getting 1/2 plus 1 over 2n

01:00:35.354 --> 01:00:37.770
probability of winning, no
matter what you do in the whole

01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:40.420
world, OK?

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.620
And if you use
this strategy here,

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.950
no matter what I do, even
knowing that's your strategy,

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:52.730
I can't keep you from
getting this much.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.620
It's called a minimax solution.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.170
So my optimal strategy is to
pick uniformly in 0 to 99,

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:00.470
and the next one's one more.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.880
Your optimal strategy is this.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.447
Pick a number uniformly in
the half integers there,

01:01:06.447 --> 01:01:08.030
and swap if you see
something smaller.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.310
And there's no better strategy.

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:12.270
In fact, any
deterministic strategy,

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.220
you don't do better than 50-50.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:20.640
The optimal strategies require
randomness for each of us.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:27.320
OK, any more questions about
what happened here, this game?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.642
Yeah.

01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:30.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when you see

01:01:30.205 --> 01:01:32.971
a small number you're going
to swap, does that just mean

01:01:32.971 --> 01:01:35.380
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:39.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically,
yeah, that's what it means.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.650
Effectively, that 50
is your random number.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:44.180
If you think OK, if I see less
than 50, I'm going to swap,

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.240
bigger than 50 I don't.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.710
Now you have to
decide what happens

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:49.010
at 50, if you saw exactly 50.

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:52.819
So you'd probably go in at
49 and 1/2 and 50 and 1/2.

01:01:52.819 --> 01:01:54.610
And so that could be
construed as that way.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.400
But you didn't pick it
randomly, and that sort

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.130
of human intuition,
to swap so I could

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.980
use that now to
design my strategy,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.780
knowing that your random
numbers could be 50 and 1/2, OK?

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.010
No, I'll be 50-50
because what I'll

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:13.740
do, if I know that's
your strategy,

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.990
my numbers will be 1 and 2.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.480
Well, when you do
these analyses,

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.540
you sort of, if it's declared
that's it, I can assume that.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.486
And I might actually guess that.

01:02:25.486 --> 01:02:28.150
In fact, that's why I did pick
two very small numbers and two

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:29.590
very big numbers.

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:31.170
But given the
perverse nature here,

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.830
when you saw the big
number, you got rid of it,

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:37.780
and when you saw the
small number, you kept it.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.820
So you sort of did
reverse psychology

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.900
and it worked out, by chance,
that it worked out that.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.047
Normally it would go
the other way, I think.

01:02:47.047 --> 01:02:48.880
Of course, you've all
seen enough games now,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.800
you know to do the
non-standard thing, I think.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.409
Now, this kind of thinking
comes up all the time

01:02:56.409 --> 01:02:57.700
in computer science algorithms.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.550
You know, the
protocol that's used

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:02.720
to communicate across
a network, ethernet,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.750
shared bus is randomized.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:09.060
Each entity that wants to use
the bus flips a random number,

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.040
flips a random coin.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.430
You could think of it that way.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:14.270
And it broadcasts
with that probability.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:16.150
And if there's a
collision, it backs off

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:18.530
and chooses a smaller
probability next time.

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:21.400
And if it gets through, then it
tries to cram a bunch of stuff

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.060
through, until you
get a collision again.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.680
The best algorithms for
sorting a list of numbers

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.780
are randomized, quick sort,
which you'll see in 6046,

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.800
is a randomized algorithm.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.170
In fact, it's not dissimilar.

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:37.017
You guess a random value
and split all the numbers

01:03:37.017 --> 01:03:38.100
based on the random value.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.030
Who's bigger, who's smaller,
and then you [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:44.670
You do things like that.

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:49.900
OK, that's all I'm going to say
about uniform distributions.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:54.400
Next I want to talk about
the binomial distribution.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.300
And this is the most
important distribution

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.510
in computer science, and
probably the most important

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:07.730
in all of discrete
calculations in the sciences.

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.480
In continuous distributions,
you get the normal distribution.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:16.562
But, for discrete problems, the
binomial is the most important.

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:17.910
And there's two versions.

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:21.820
There's the unbiased
binomial distribution

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.301
and then there's the biased one.

01:04:28.462 --> 01:04:30.170
Now this one's a little
more complicated.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:34.460
You've got a parameter n again,
and the distribution function

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.130
on k, probability
of getting k is

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:42.000
n choose k times
2 to the minus n.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.560
And n is at least 1, and
k is between 0 and n.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:05:01.790
And then for the general
binomial distribution,

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.140
we have fn of k, the
probability of getting

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:10.270
k is n choose k times--
actually, it's fnp,

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.500
there's another
parameter p here.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.585
p to the k times 1 minus
p to the n minus k power.

01:05:17.585 --> 01:05:20.640
And p is a value between
0 to 1 typically.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.330
It's a probability of
something happening.

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:26.560
So in the general
case, you've got nnp.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.750
The unbiased case
corresponds to when p is 1/2.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:35.200
Because if p is 1/2, you get 2
to the minus k and 2 the minus

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.600
n minus k, and that's
just 2 to the minus n.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.990
So you can think of this
as the case when p is 1/2.

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:50.100
All right, to give
you an example why

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.230
this is so important, why
it comes up all the time.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:59.030
Imagine that you've got a
system with n components.

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:03.159
And that each component
fails with probability p.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.590
And you want to know the
probability of having

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.565
some number of failures.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:22.890
So for example,
there's n components

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:32.900
and each fails independently--
in fact, mutually

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:40.190
independently--
with probability p.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.620
And p will be between 0 and 1.

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:51.400
And now we're interested
in the number of failures,

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.250
so we'll make R be a
random variable that

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.245
tells us the number
of failed components.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.750
And it turns out
the answer is simply

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:09.420
that function, which
we'll prove is a theorem.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:19.005
The probability that R equals k
is simply fnp of k [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.310
So the general
binomial distribution

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.850
gives you the distribution
on the number of failures

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.060
in a system with
n components where

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.638
they fail with probability p.

01:07:34.638 --> 01:07:36.120
So let's prove that.

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:51.920
To do that, we're going to
construct our tree again.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.000
It's a little big because
you've got n components.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.180
But you look at the
first component,

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.480
and that can fail or not.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.430
And it fails a probability p.

01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.710
It's OK with
probability 1 minus p.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:08.132
And you have the
second component.

01:08:08.132 --> 01:08:10.740
It can fail or not.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.390
Again p and 1 minus p.

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:22.733
And you keep on going until
you get to the nth component.

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:32.850
And that can fail or not, the
probability p or 1 minus p,

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:33.950
in general down here.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.960
And now we look at all the
sample points out here.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:54.160
And it's all length and
vectors of failure or not.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.979
So the top sample point here
would be n good components.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:05.370
All right, the next one would
be the first n minus 1 are good,

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.420
the last one failed.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.170
All the way down
to the very bottom,

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.380
you can have all n fail.

01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:17.370
All right, so how many sample
points are there in the sample

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:23.170
space with n components?

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:24.830
2 to the n, all right?

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.760
Because you've got n positions.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.960
There's two choices
for each value there.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.010
Now how many of
the sample points

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:40.109
have exactly k
failed components?

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.210
Out of the 2 to the
n, how many correspond

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:44.819
to k of the components fail?

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:51.820
n choose k-- now this
goes back to counting.

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.690
Remember the
binomial coefficient.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:10:06.960
So there are n choose
k sample points have

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.400
k failed components.

01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:18.770
All right, what's the
probability of a sample

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.560
point with k failed components?

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:30.950
Well, I took k branches
with a failure.

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:36.480
Each of those gives
me a p, p to the k.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.900
And I took n minus k
branches with no failure.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.340
Each one of those
multiplies by a 1 minus p.

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.080
So no matter how I
got my k failures,

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.000
the probability for a particular
sample point with k failures

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.170
is just that, because I had
p get factored in k times,

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.900
in the failures, 1
minus p get factored

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.381
in n minus k times
for the situations

01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:04.630
where it worked out all right.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.980
So I've got this
many sample points.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:22.870
Each of them has probability
p to the k times 1

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:25.300
minus p n minus k.

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.420
Any questions about that,
why that's the case?

01:11:33.692 --> 01:11:35.650
All right, so now I can
compute the probability

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.730
there are k failures.

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.040
The probability that
R equals k is simply n

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.870
choose k, number of sample
points times their probability,

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.920
since they're all the
same for k failures.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.830
And that, of course,
is just the formula

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:59.290
for the general
binomial distribution.

01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:06.146
So that equals fnp of k, which
is what we are trying to prove.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:14.050
OK.

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:16.840
Any questions about that?

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.980
So that's why it's
important, because there's

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:22.100
a lot of situations where
you're interested in the number

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.330
of-- if you had n
possible things,

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:26.590
what's the chance
k of them happen?

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:30.630
And it's just given
by this formula.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:36.850
Now you can calculate this,
but, if I just told you,

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:45.310
for example, maybe I'm looking
at n is 100 and even p is 1/2,

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.490
you know, what's the
probability that we'd

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:51.690
get 25-- say, what's
the probably if getting

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.140
50 failed components?

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.480
Or if I flip 100 coins
and they're fair.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.730
So probability half
of getting a heads.

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:05.680
What's the chance I actually
get 50 heads in 100 coins?

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.950
Looking at that, it's not
so clear what the answer is.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:14.570
In fact, let's test
intuition here, for this.

01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:16.140
We're going to
take a little vote

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.720
to see how good you are
looking at that formula,

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.420
or what your intuition is about
the probability of getting

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.695
exactly 50 heads.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.534
It could be between 1 and
1/2, a half and a tenth,

01:13:34.534 --> 01:13:40.030
a tenth and a hundredth, a
hundredth and one thousandth,

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:44.259
a thousandth and a
millionth, and 0.

01:13:44.259 --> 01:13:46.050
I want to know what's
the probability, when

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.810
you flip 100 mutually
independent coins,

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:52.370
you get exactly 50 heads?

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.870
How many people think
it's at least a half,

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.900
that you get half heads?

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:58.920
Nobody likes that.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.640
How many people think it's
between a half and a tenth?

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.890
One vote.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.280
A tenth and a hundredth?

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:06.780
More.

01:14:08.939 --> 01:14:10.730
Doesn't it have to be
at least a hundredth?

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.354
That's sort of the
most likely outcome.

01:14:12.354 --> 01:14:16.600
There's only-- how many think
a hundredth and a thousandth?

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.350
All right.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:19.840
A thousandth and a millionth?

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.040
Whoa, so you've got
to believe it is not

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.560
likely to get exactly 50
heads when I flip 100 coins.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.690
All right, well the
answer is actually

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.660
between a tenth and
a hundredth here.

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:34.910
It's about 8%.

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:36.570
And we're going to compute that.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:38.330
But here's another one.

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:40.370
I flip 100 coins.

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:46.520
What's the probability of
getting at most 25 heads?

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.605
So here, doesn't have
to be exactly 25.

01:14:48.605 --> 01:14:53.400
It could be 25, 24, 23, 22,
all the way down to no heads.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.560
So a lot of chances, all right?

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.630
To get at most 25 heads.

01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:00.200
How many people think it's here?

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.770
Some, yeah, you've
got a lot of chances.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.885
How about here?

01:15:04.885 --> 01:15:06.230
Yeah, OK.

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:09.858
What about between a
tenth and a hundredth?

01:15:09.858 --> 01:15:12.940
One person, two people left.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.930
Between a hundredth
and a thousandth?

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:16.620
Nobody left?

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.050
Anybody here?

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:20.630
Thousandth and a millionth?

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:22.340
One person is left,
less than a million.

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.630
1 in a million?

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:25.880
There's the contrarian.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:31.310
And you're right, the chance
of getting 25 or less heads

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:34.330
is less than 1 in a million.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:39.020
So if somebody does it, his
name better be Persi Diaconis.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.710
To get it consistently to 70,
[INAUDIBLE] 25 or fewer heads.

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:48.160
You get 75 tails or more is
extremely unlikely, all right?

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.660
So to see why that's
the case, we've

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.900
got to do a little
work on this formula.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.820
Because we're saying that if
we sum this up for k ending 100

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.470
and k being 0 to 25,
and p being a half,

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:04.600
it's an incredibly tiny number.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.922
So let's see why that is.

01:16:05.922 --> 01:16:07.380
And this phenomenon
is course going

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.690
to be important in
computer science

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.290
because it's going to enable
you to tell almost exactly how

01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:15.120
many components are going
to fail in a system,

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.617
if they're mutually independent.

01:16:30.624 --> 01:16:33.040
All right, now I'm not going
to drag you through the math.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.760
It's bad enough I'm going
to write it on the board.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.320
There's a bunch of
this in the text.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.560
And instead of k, I'm going to
represent by a parameter alpha

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.452
times n to be the integer k.

01:16:46.452 --> 01:16:50.330
All right, this will replace
k with a new parameter alpha.

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:54.190
It's at most, and also it's
asymptotically equivalent

01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:58.390
using tilde-- both of those are
true-- to this nasty looking

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:08.900
expression, 2 to the
alpha log p over alpha

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:18.740
plus 1 minus alpha log 1 minus
p over 1 minus alpha times

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:26.000
and n-- that's a big number,
it's 100-- over square root 2

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.840
pi alpha 1 minus alpha n.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.875
And this, of course,
alpha is between 0 and 1.

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.970
Now when you do the
derivative on this thing,

01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.840
it turns out its maximum
value is when alpha equals p.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:57.580
And when you have alpha equals
p, you get log of 1 is 0,

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.640
log of 1 is 0.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.090
All this messy stuff goes
away and we just get that.

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:10.520
And so in that case, fnp
of pn is at most, and also

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:19.130
asymptotically equal to 1 over
square root 2 pi p 1 minus p n.

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.860
And now you can plug in
values and compute things.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.880
For example, if
I flip 100 coins,

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.720
and I want to know the
probability of getting 50--

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.240
that means alpha's a
half, and they're fair,

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.080
which means p is a
half, the answer is 8%.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.240
So n equals 100 coins,
p is a half, then

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.730
the probability of 50 heads.

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:55.840
I just plug in p is a half here,
I get 1 over square root 50 pi,

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.670
which equals 0.080 and so forth.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:05.905
So there's an 8% chance of
getting exactly 50 heads.

01:19:05.905 --> 01:19:07.280
Now let's look at
the probability

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.670
of getting 25 or fewer.

01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:13.548
And we'll see why that
is so surprisingly small.

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:38.160
OK, so for n equal
100 and p equal

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.630
a half an alpha equal a quarter,
because we want 25 heads,

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:46.110
I'll get exactly 25 heads first.

01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:52.460
Probability of 25
heads is at most,

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:57.900
well that square root thing
comes out to about 0.09.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.230
Then I get 2 to something.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:09.380
I get 2 to the minus, all those
logs come out the 0.1887 times

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.920
n, which is the
kicker, that's 100.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.730
So I get a 2 to the
minus 18th here.

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:21.080
And that makes this
thing be smaller than

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:26.230
or equal about to 1.913
times 10 to the minus 7.

01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:29.960
So about 1 in 5 million.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.760
The reason this gets
so small is because you

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.872
get the n in that
exponent up there.

01:20:35.872 --> 01:20:37.330
And of course, this
is all computed

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:39.560
using Stirling's formula,
if you actually want

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.370
to go through the calculations.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:46.190
You go start with n choose
k, which is your n factorial,

01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:48.980
times over k factorial
n minus k factorial.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.280
Plug in Stirling's formula and
you do a bunch of messy stuff,

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.840
and these things pop out.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.720
And so it gets exponentially
small, exponentially fast.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.270
In fact, if you were
to plot this thing,

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.510
if you plot the binomial
distribution function,

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:06.520
it looks something like this.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:21.380
All right, so I have
0 to n, and then I

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.957
have pn, which is the maximum.

01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:25.915
Here's the probability.

01:21:25.915 --> 01:21:28.560
It goes 0 to 1.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.310
And your maximum value is here
at 8% in the case of 100 coins,

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:39.980
and it just zooms down
exponential small.

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.110
You can't even draw because
it gets so small so fast.

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:50.840
This height here is
about 1 over root n.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.920
And this width here of
the hump, is about root n.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.470
And these things zoom down
to 0, exponentially fast.

01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:04.220
And so that's what the binomial
distribution looks like.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:12.110
And so it says that you are very
likely to be very close to pn

01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:15.494
heads, or pn things happening.

01:22:15.494 --> 01:22:17.660
And I won't go through the
math now-- probably do it

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.300
in recitation
tomorrow-- of computing

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.770
at most 25 heads, which is
the cumulative distribution

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:25.222
function.

01:22:25.222 --> 01:22:26.930
And this comes up in
all sorts of places.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:29.920
Like you have a noisy
communications channel,

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.620
and every bit as
dropped with 1% chance.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.340
If you have 10,000
bits, you'd like

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:40.000
to know, what's the
probability I lost 2% of them

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.990
when I have 1% failure rate?

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:46.050
The chance of losing
2% out of 10,000

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:49.500
is like 2 to the minus 60 if
they're mutually independent.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.001
So no chance of losing 2%.

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:52.876
All right, very good.

01:22:52.876 --> 01:22:55.730
We'll do more this in
recitation tomorrow.

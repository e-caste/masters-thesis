00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.650
PROFESSOR: Now let me
conclude for a few minutes

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.360
by introducing the idea of how
we're going to perturb things.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.855
So how are we going to set
up our perturbation theory?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.960
So for a perturbation theory
we will do the following.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.060
We will take our system
and introduce again--

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:44.830
so setting up the
perturbation expansion.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.300
So we want to give you just an
idea of what we're going to do.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:05.280
So H of t is going to be H
of 0 plus delta of H of t.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.680
And now your lambda is going
to be treated as small.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.210
So again, we're going to use
a power series expansion,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.550
and everything is going
to depend on lambda.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.260
And we're going to think
coefficients in that way.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.050
We're going to work with
the state psi tilde.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.450
You remember, if
you know psi tilde,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.050
you put an e to the minus ih 0t
over H bar and you can get H.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.160
So we'll set the
perturbation for psi tilde.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.510
And it will have
a zeroth part that

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.700
is time dependent plus a first
part that is time dependent.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.610
Every term is going to be time
dependent in the perturbation.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.460
And what was our
Schroedinger equation?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.210
Our Schroedinger equation was
ih bar d dt of psi tilde of t

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:30.040
was delta H, like
that, times psi of t.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040
But we need to change
things a little bit.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.380
We replace delta H
by lambda delta H.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.170
So now it's going to
have a lambda here.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.580
So I now need to
plug in this thing,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.680
which is not going
to be too difficult.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.060
It's easier than what we did in
time independent perturbation

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.640
theory.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.550
d dt of psi 0--

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.410
let me not put the time
dependence in the case psi 1

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.270
lambda square psi 2.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:25.370
And this is equal to lambda
delta H bar psi tilde again.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:37.010
So it's psi 0 plus psi
1 plus those terms.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.820
So for here we'll just
read the first few terms.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.980
They're pretty easy.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.250
There's not much of
a lambda thing there.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.060
So what do we get?

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.870
Terms without lambda.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:14.990
ih bar d dt of psi
tilde 0 of t equals 0.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.899
This is lambda to the 0.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.390
That's the only term
without the lambda,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.020
the one that arises here.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.210
Terms without lambda already.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.250
Well, there's one
term here, which

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:39.680
is Schroedinger-like.
d dt of psi 1

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.640
is, in fact, equal
to order of lambda.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:52.670
You have delta H
tilde psi 0 of t.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:01.190
And the next one, ih
bar d dt of psi 2 of t--

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.700
that's lambda squared-- comes
from the derivative acting

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.200
here.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.820
We have to look for
lambda squared here.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.985
And I forgot this lambda.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:28.000
And therefore, this time
you get delta H psi 1 of t.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:42.826
In general, for lambda n, you
will get ih bar d dt of psi n--

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:46.630
I'll actually put n
plus 1, n plus 1 here--

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.180
is given by delta H acting
on the previous one.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.860
So this will be simple.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.880
Once you know psi 0, which is
a constant, you put it here.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.440
This will be easily
solved as an integral.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.720
Once you have psi
1, you put it here.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.620
You easily solve psi 2 and
start solving one after another.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.680
The fun thing is that you
can write these equations

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.550
explicitly.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.440
And just even the first
order result, and sometimes

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.150
the second, give you all
the physics you want,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.320
which we will explore in
the next few lectures.

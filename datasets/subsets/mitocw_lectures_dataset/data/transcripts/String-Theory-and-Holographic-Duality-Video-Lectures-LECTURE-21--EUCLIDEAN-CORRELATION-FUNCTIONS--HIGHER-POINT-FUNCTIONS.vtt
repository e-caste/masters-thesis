00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:22.750
HONG LIU: And let us start.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.040
So let me again start
by reminding you

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.995
what we did before.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.170
So consider, say, we have
a scalar field in AdS

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
So let me just summarize
what we did before.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:59.360
So consider, say,
a scalar field,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:09.350
phi, in AdS and with mass
times square, so with mass

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.130
squared given by m
squared, then we know,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.725
when you go to the
boundary of AdS-- so let's

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:22.010
take z goes to 0--
then phi will have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.080
the following
asymptotic behavior.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.120
So these are the two independent
modes of phi [? to ?] infinity.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.760
Of course, there are higher
order corrections in z.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.170
And this delta is
given by 1/2 d plus nu.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.310
And nu is given by
this square divided

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.326
by 4 plus m squared r squared.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:11.314
So this is the behavior.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.625
And so this phi is assumed to
be dual to some boundary, scalar

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:25.125
operator.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.960
And then all of
those quantities,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.010
on the gravity side, they
all have counterparts

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.050
on field theory side.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.340
For example, the delta,
which, essentially,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.470
is a function of mass,
then, essentially, it's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.410
the scaling dimension of O.
It's a scaling dimension of O.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.730
And this Ax
essentially translates

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.000
into the source for phi.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.330
Or you can consider the
momentum space version, say, you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.080
can do Fourier transform,
Ak, then go to the phi k.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.410
And then we also showed, last
time, that the 2 nu times Bx

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.420
is actually related to the
expectation value of O.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.815
And again, there's a
momentum space version of it.

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:27.440
So you can just
Fourier transform, then

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.910
become O k and Bk.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.160
And in particular,
in the example,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.760
we can see the
scalar field example.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.759
In particular, in the
example, you can see that.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.850
So we derived this relation
from a free scalar field.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.500
but you can actually show this
relation is actually generally

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.560
true at non-linear level.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.330
So if you also include the high
orders, et cetera, so including

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.260
non-linear dependence on
phi, actually this relation

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.305
remains true.

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:19.670
But due to the time, we
will not go into that.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.410
The proof is actually
not very difficult.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.440
So you can see that the
free scalar examples--

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.273
so, in the example, we
can see that actually

00:04:28.273 --> 00:04:35.360
the B-- so in momentum
space, the B is actually

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.485
proportional to A. If you
remember what we did last time.

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:46.210
So in other words,
this one-point

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.890
function-- so B is related
to the one-point function.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.080
So in other words,
the one-point function

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.090
it's proportional to the source.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.540
So this is the standard story.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.040
Say all x equal to 0
when phi equal to 0.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.540
So if you don't have the source,
then this one-point function

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.940
is 0.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.830
So you don't have a spontaneous
expectation value for the O.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.640
And now the fact that
B is proportional to A,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:36.640
so this is just reflects that,
in the presence of the source,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.430
then, of course, the
expectation value-- so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.020
let me write it in momentum
space for simplicity.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.400
Then we're no
longer [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.470
Assume the source is small, then
you can expand the expectation

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.880
value in power series of phi.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.590
So to the 0, so that
would be phi, and then

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.610
phi squared, et cetera.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.420
So at linearized
level, say we just find

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.226
O k is proportional to phi k.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.870
We just find that O k is
proportional to phi k.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.740
And the proportional
constant is, in fact,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.740
the two-point function.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.979
So at linear level, so O k would
be just proportional to phi k,

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.520
but the proportional constant
is just the two-point function.

00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:46.990
So the reason is very simple.

00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:54.200
First, let me write
down the definition

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
of this two-point function.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.560
So GEx in coordinate
space is defined

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.115
to be O x of 0, because
of translational symmetry,

00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:08.050
so I can put the
other point to be 0.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.007
So this is only the
function of one variable, x.

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:13.465
And then you can
Fourier transform,

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:15.196
and then you get GEk.

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:16.570
So this is how we
define the GEk.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.920
So to see that this
is true, you need

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.800
to remember that
the GEk is given

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:39.290
from taking the generating
functional, delta phi k

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.570
and delta phi minus k, then
you set phi equal to 0.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:50.002
So this is the definition
of the two-point function.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.376
And then next, you can see
that the [? one  derivative ?]

00:07:52.376 --> 00:07:59.110
of phi minus k-- so you can see
that this takes 1 derivative

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.860
on phi minus k.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.610
That just gives you
the one-point function

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.650
in the presence of phi
and then delta phi k.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.060
And take phi equal to 0.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.140
So I just evaluated
this derivative.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.679
So if you take this
generating functional,

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:19.845
take one derivative, we
just get one-point function.

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:23.620
And then this is the
other point function.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.650
Then at the linear
level-- so if O k

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.980
is linear in phi k, of
course, taking the derivative

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.960
is just the same as dividing it.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.970
So this is the same.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.100
So continue over.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:49.290
This is the same just as to
the phi k divided by phi k

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.610
at the linearized level.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.062
And then so this tells you
that this pre-factor is just

00:08:54.062 --> 00:08:55.020
the two-point function.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.160
And so we can now write a
two-point function explicitly

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.760
in terms of B and A,
so this is just given,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.690
because this is 2 nu Bk.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.080
So this is just given by that.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.830
So this is just a quick
summary of what we

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.670
did at the end of last lecture.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.870
So that's how you can find
the two-point function.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.480
So you work out what
B is, what the A is,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.770
and then the rest of them
is the two-point function.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:47.527
And the way we work out the
B and A is the following.

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.110
So at the linearized level, when
you solve the equation motion

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.580
for phi, then you impose
the boundary conditions

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.604
at infinity, A should
be equal to phi.

00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:01.020
But then there's
another condition

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.290
being proposed to make
sure the phi is actually

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.320
regular in the interior.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.700
So the regularity
condition, there's still

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.900
a relation between
A and B. And then

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.950
that leads to this
two-point function.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.870
Any questions on this?

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.060
Is everything clear?

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.364
Good.

00:10:25.364 --> 00:10:27.405
So now let's consider the
higher-point functions.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.610
So this is, in principle,
straightforward to do.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:05.110
Because, recall, that the
log CFT phi, this generating

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.700
functional, in the
field theory, is just

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.640
given by the classical
action on the gravity

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.770
side, which is the boundary
condition given by phi.

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:21.260
You're solving the
classical equation

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.170
motion, the initial action.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.640
Then you just, as
we did earlier,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.590
you just solve the
equation motion for phi

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.110
to the [? linear ?] order.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.940
And then you validated
the initial action.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.890
Then you can express,
for example, this SE

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.700
in power series of phi.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.950
And then the quotient for
the power series of this phi

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.540
then just gives you
correlation functions.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.620
So the principle of this
is straightforward to do.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.620
We know how to solve the
classical equation motion.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.100
We know how to plug
back into the action,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.950
and then you are done.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.522
So just to be able
to be more specific,

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.605
let's consider an example.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.671
Let's just consider
two examples.

00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:27.545
Again, let we just
consider the scalar field.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.590
Now, I add the linear term.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.780
For illustration, let me
give you two examples.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.870
And so a very important thing is
that in our set-up, the lambda,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.440
this cubic quotient is
proportional to kappa.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.830
And then if you translate
into the field series side,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.180
this is 1/n.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.300
So remember, for anything
in the gravity action,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.990
you always have the 1
over kappa squared, 1

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.370
over G Newton before
[INAUDIBLE] action.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.870
And then when we try to
change phi into canonical

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.370
normalized, and then
you rescale phi.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.560
And the consequence is that
this cubic term or quartic term,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.820
then they will have quotients
proportionate to kappa.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.080
And according to this rule, if
you have a quartic term, then

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.070
that will be proportional
to kappa squared, et cetera.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.774
And so the key is that as
far as [? phi is ?] order 1,

00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:41.940
then you can actually treat
those higher-order terms

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.760
by perturbation because
the quotient is small.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:53.750
And of course, you can
also consider the situation

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.208
in which phi is
large, and then you

00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:57.072
have to solve the full
nonlinear problem.

00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:59.930
Then you cannot do a
perturbative expansion.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.080
You have to do the problem.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.740
So for our purpose,
if you want to find

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.080
the higher-point
function for phi,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.790
then you need to
solve this equation.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.700
So box phi is just
a Laplace operator.

00:14:19.228 --> 00:14:20.860
I just save time.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.660
So you need to
solve this equation.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:44.090
And with the boundary condition
still the boundary condition,

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.810
the boundary value of capital
phi to equal to this phi x.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.900
And let me call
this equation star.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.690
So as I said, because
this lambda is small,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.744
you can actually try to
solve this equation just

00:15:00.744 --> 00:15:01.785
perturbatively in lambda.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.720
And essentially, you're solving
it perturbatively in this phi,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.440
because everything, in the end,
will be expressed in this phi.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:34.850
So one can solve
star perturbatively

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:40.760
in phi, which is the
boundary value of the field.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:47.822
And say phi c, you can expand it
as phi 1 plus phi 2, et cetera,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.280
so the classical
solution expanded.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.350
And this linear in phi.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:16:01.010
And this is quadratic
in phi-- and et cetera.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:10.130
And then when you plug
back this into the action,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.240
then you find on
the initial action

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.310
can also be expanded in
power series of this phi.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:22.365
So you will have S2 phi plus--
started with quadratic order--

00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:27.030
and 3 phi, et cetera.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.270
And then the quotient here gives
you the two-point function.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.999
And then quotient here gives
you the three-point function.

00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:36.540
And the quotient here gives a
four-point function, et cetera.

00:16:46.432 --> 00:16:48.045
I hope the procedure is clear.

00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:57.415
Any questions regarding this?

00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:07.859
So even though this is
very straightforward

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.800
to do, conceptually,
but in practice

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.720
that it not what we would do,
because this is a very tedious.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.859
It's very tedious.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.770
And our knowledge of
quantum field theory

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.290
gives us something much
simpler to deal with.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:31.410
Because this, essentially,
if you think about it,

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.790
is not very different from
doing a correlation function

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.130
calculation, just in the
flat-space quantum field

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.320
theory.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.430
And there, whey you
calculate the Green function

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.380
in flat-space-- in
flat-space quantum field

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.810
theory, what do you do?

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.509
Do we try to solve the classical
equation motion and you iterate

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:52.050
the equation?

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.907
What do you do?

00:17:52.907 --> 00:17:54.100
AUDIENCE: Draw a diagram.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.270
HONG LIU: Yeah, you
use Feynman diagrams.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.680
So here, it's exactly
the same thing.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.720
So here it's much easier if you
just do the Feynman diagrams.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.810
So let me first remind you
what we do in the flat-space.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.740
So let's now go to
the field theory

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:24.040
one, standard, ordinary
flat-space QFT.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.570
So now let's consider the lambda
phi cubed theory in flat-space

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.040
Just the same theory now
using the flat-space.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:42.131
Let me call this star-star.

00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:44.005
So essentially, let's
just consider star-star

00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:51.486
in flat-space, now in
flat Euclidean space.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.680
So if we are given a
field theory like that,

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.790
so how would you calculate the
following correlation function?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:15.600
Say, suppose I want to
calculate phi x1, phi xn.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.495
So now this x1, xn, they're
just flat-space coordinates.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.150
To distinguish them,
let me just call y1,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.470
yn, just not to confuse
about the AdS coordinate.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:37.120
So in flat-space
with y, y mu, OK?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.854
In flat-space with
coordinate y mu.

00:19:40.854 --> 00:19:43.020
So now suppose you want to
calculate the correlation

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.770
function for this.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.110
What do you do?

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.330
So what do you do?

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:55.990
It's easy.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:05.980
What you do is that this
theory has a propagator, G,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.530
[? with ?] [? arrow ?]
propagator.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.270
And also, this theory
have a interaction vertex,

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.320
which is controlled by lambda.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:21.280
And then, when you calculate
such endpoint functions,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.310
you just fix your endpoint.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.680
So now remember, this is
slightly different than what

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.549
you would normally do
in field theory one,

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:32.340
because, here, we're
doing coordinate space

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.360
rather than momentum space.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.800
In field theory one, you're more
used to doing momentum space.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:46.360
So here what you do is that you
fix y1, y2 y3, extends to yn.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.930
So this is essentially the
location of your insertion,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.820
of your field insertion.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.240
So essentially, imagine
there's a source there.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.230
And then you just connect
all the extended points

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:09.250
by propagators and with these
kind of interaction vertices.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:19.940
So for example, you can have
something like this, et cetera.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.830
And this connects to
some boundary point,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.870
some other point,
et cetera-- say y's.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.940
And this also have lines.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.810
We just draw all
possible diagrams,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.840
and you calculate that diagram.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.320
You calculate those diagrams,
and they give you this thing.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.846
And essentially, the
diagrams automatically

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.220
give you the
iteration procedure.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.400
So now, back to
AdS, essentially, we

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.000
can just do exactly
the same thing.

00:22:00.989 --> 00:22:02.530
Just remind yourself
of the procedure

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.510
of calculating this and what
we are going to do here,

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.790
and you easily
convince yourself.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.620
So it requires a couple
of minutes' thinking,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.820
but we'll leave it to yourself.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.250
Actually, that procedure is
no different from just doing

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.380
the calculation like this.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.975
Of course, the
difference is that now we

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.804
are in the curved spacetime
rather than flat spacetime.

00:22:33.804 --> 00:22:35.345
But there's another
major difference.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.800
So here, the source all lies in
the interior of your spacetime,

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.560
where you inserted the operator.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.470
But here, all the source, phi
x, they lie at the boundary.

00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:08.865
That's, essentially,
the only difference.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.630
So if I just schematically--
so this is AdS.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.184
This is the boundary.

00:23:19.184 --> 00:23:21.600
And essentially, all the points
are lying on the boundary,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.020
like we have x1, x2.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.720
So let's consider
four-point function.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.770
Because each one of them is
labeled by the boundary point.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:39.720
And then for the four-point
function, you just connect.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.810
So you can connect
the diagram like this.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.960
Again, you have
the vertices, which

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.180
is the [? cube ?] of vertices.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.690
But your endpoint is all
lying on the boundary.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.260
So this structure also
tells you, actually,

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.070
there's two types
of propagators.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.120
Because one type of propagator
connects the two bulk points.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.150
And then there's this
kind of propagator

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.150
which connects the bulk point
into the boundary points.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.870
So this is the difference,
one major difference,

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.360
from the flat-space case.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.330
So here, all the
propagators are the same.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.491
So here, the difference
is now, you also

00:24:23.491 --> 00:24:25.740
have propagators which come
from boundary to the bulk.

00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:30.500
So in this case, there are
two kind of propagators.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:50.990
Here, you have two
type of propagators.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.420
So one type of propagator
is what we call

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.770
the bulk-to-bulk propagator.

00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:13.350
Somehow this is going up and up.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.435
OK, I lost some
blackboard space.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.090
So this the complete
analog, this

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:45.750
is the precise counterpart
of the flat-space propagator.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:51.875
So this connects two points,
z, x, z prime, x prime.

00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:55.684
So I still use the
notation that z is the bulk

00:25:55.684 --> 00:25:56.600
[INAUDIBLE] direction.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.349
And the x is along the
boundary direction.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.180
And this bulk-to-bulk will
satisfy the standard Laplace

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:14.260
equation just as in flat-space.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.970
So this gives you
the delta function.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:35.550
Let me just express it, z minus
z prime delta x minus x prime.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.780
So this is a complete analog
of the standard flat-space

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.790
propagator.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.160
It's just now in
Anti-de Sitter space.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:27:07.278
So this is a counterpart in AdS
standard flat-space propagator.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:27.420
So in particular,
so as a propagator,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:56.207
this should be normalizable
in either z or z prime,

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:57.790
so when you take
them to the boundary.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:10.970
So more explicitly, for
example, the z at z prime,

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.775
x prime, should scale as z
prime to the power delta, when

00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:17.190
you take z prime goes to 0.

00:28:23.639 --> 00:28:25.430
And of course, this
should also be regular.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.940
We should not have singularities
as z goes to infinity.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.184
They should also be regular.

00:28:38.184 --> 00:28:40.100
So essentially, these
condition will precisely

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.950
define those propagators.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.940
But the idea is we
also, because the source

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.010
lies on the boundary, because
of this boundary condition,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.225
we also have so-called
boundary-to-bulk propagators.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.730
Actually, the standard
in flat-space one,

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.720
it propagates the field from
one point to the other point.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.220
So that's why there's
a delta function here.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.520
So the standard story,
there's a delta function here.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:02.020
And you propagate
the field starting

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.040
from this point to that point.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.590
So this boundary-to-bulk
propagator normally is written

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:18.470
as k z,x, but the second
index only has x prime,

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.970
because this is when you take
the boundary point to a bulk

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.470
point.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.180
A boundary point, of course,
there's no z anymore.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.100
So z prime is 0 here.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.270
You don't need to write it.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.560
And this boundary-to-bulk
propagator,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.695
again, should satisfy
the Laplace equation.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.750
But now the key point is
that, on the right-hand side,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.320
because there's no bulk
source, so the right-hand side

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.790
should be 0 rather than
the delta function.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:54.070
So that delta function is
due to the bulk source.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.560
But we have to make
sure this k have

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.360
the right
non-normalizable boundary

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.950
conditions, so you
have the right boundary

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.050
condition to the boundary.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:16.260
So this when it approach to
the boundary, as z goes to 0,

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:22.680
should be like z d delta,
delta x minus x prime.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:35.340
So the k satisfies the Laplace
equation without a source.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:43.520
But when you take this
propagator to the boundary,

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.660
then it should give you the
non-normalizable boundary

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.540
conditions, because you
should approach a source.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:55.690
And the delta
function is put here.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.800
So if you write,
say, a bulk field,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:07.570
which is sourced by some
boundary source, say k z, x,

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:15.450
x prime times phi x
prime, and then this

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:23.330
will have right
boundary condition

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:32.155
that the phi x, z goes
to z d minus delta phi x.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.110
So this boundary-to-bulk
propagator

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.460
does not have a
source in the bulk

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.690
but does have a source
in the boundary,

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.825
non-normalizable
off in the boundary.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.780
So now with this two
propagator, then the story

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.750
is just actually as
in the standard way

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.420
you obtain the Green functions.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.750
It's just really no different.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:20.565
So let me just summarize
what we have discussed.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:47.830
The boundary
endpoint function can

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:54.260
be obtained by, essentially,
endpoint function of the phi

00:33:54.260 --> 00:34:04.340
field in the gravity side--
let me write it here-- just

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.389
related to the endpoint
function of the gravity field

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:18.310
on the gravity side, with
all these points, x1, xn,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.850
they're lying on the boundary.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.800
This side is treated as
ordinary field theory.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.170
Then compute this endpoint
function of your field

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.320
but just put the
field on the boundary.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.110
And then that would just
give you the AdS correlation

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.830
functions.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.050
Yeah, and then you just
need to distinguish

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:57.000
two types of propagators,
a bulk-to-bulk propagator

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and bulk-to-boundary propagator.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.763
So any questions regarding this?

00:35:01.763 --> 00:35:06.230
AUDIENCE: Now, here,
[INAUDIBLE] d minus delta.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:11.035
Right there, the G goes to
[? d ?] phi in the delta.

00:35:11.035 --> 00:35:11.660
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:35:14.558 --> 00:35:18.262
AUDIENCE: But why
aren't they different?

00:35:18.262 --> 00:35:20.220
HONG LIU: It's because
this must have a source.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.290
So the boundary-to-bulk
propagator--

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.120
you propagate the source,
from the boundary to the bulk,

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.730
so that means that field
must have the right boundary

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:30.230
condition.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.990
So that's the reason for this.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.530
We must have non-normalizable
boundary conditions.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.300
And that propagator is just the
standard flat-space propagator.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.620
Of course, it's
always normalizable.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.480
And in the flat-space,
when you construct

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.084
a propagator, of
course, it's always

00:35:49.084 --> 00:35:50.625
used in a normalizable
wave function.

00:35:53.355 --> 00:35:55.655
AUDIENCE: This is
that's non-normalizable?

00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:57.280
HONG LIU: No, this
is non-normalizable.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.190
This is designed so that
you have the right boundary

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.690
condition.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.390
So this is designed so
that you can propagate

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.280
just as in flat-space.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.070
If you have phi at
this point, and then

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.480
you can propagate to the
other point by convolution.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.000
And of course, when you write
down the bulk field phi,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.050
in general, you only
construct them out

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.340
of the normalizable modes.

00:36:33.542 --> 00:36:34.125
Any questions?

00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:41.270
Good.

00:36:44.727 --> 00:36:46.060
So now let me make some remarks.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:00.000
So here, this
procedure of iterating

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
the classical
equation of motion,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.780
solving the classical
equation of motion,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.910
then iterating the
action, of course,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.391
again, from our experience
with quantum field theory, that

00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:13.015
only gives you the
tree-level diagrams.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:20.440
So if I really write
the bulk path integral,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.450
so Z CFT phi, then, in
the same classical limit,

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.590
it can be written
as Z gravity, which

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.720
is phi with the right
boundary condition.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.775
And then on the gravity side,
at semi-classical level,

00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:42.139
we can actually write down the
path integral for this gravity

00:37:42.139 --> 00:37:42.930
partition function.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.560
So that's what we
discussed before.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:57.230
And then at the leading
order, in performing this path

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:14.310
integral, of
course, you just get

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.170
what we have been doing so far.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.470
You just evaluate it at
the classical solutions.

00:38:22.219 --> 00:38:24.385
But in principle, you can
also see the fluctuations.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:36.330
So this is the
fluctuations around, say,

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.510
the classical solution, phi c.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:45.040
And then the action
for the fluctuations

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.050
is just given by phi c plus phi.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.550
The minus, of course,
is the classical action.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.900
So we just expand
around the phi c.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.140
So if we expand this,
the leading order

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.680
would be quadratic in small phi.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.960
I should now quote small phi.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:12.540
Maybe let me quote chi, because
that is the same as that phi.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.320
So this chi is the small
fluctuations around the phi c.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.670
So if you expanded this
in chi, the linear order

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.180
is 0, because phi c satisfies
the equation of motion.

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.610
So this will start in quadratic
order and then cubic order, et

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.150
cetera.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.500
So you validated the
quadratic order as a Gaussian.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.610
And then that's the
one-loop diagram.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.490
And then if you go
to higher orders,

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.310
then it'll give you
higher-order diagrams.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:45.960
So if you now include
the fluctuations,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.900
so the SE phi c, which
is a classical action.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.520
This encodes only
tree-level diagrams.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:11.560
And when you include
the fluctuations, phi,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.780
the fluctuations, chi, and
then this corresponding

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.640
to include loops.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.856
So again, the whole
procedure can be captured

00:40:27.856 --> 00:40:28.855
by the Feynman diagrams.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.657
So the advantage of
the Feynman diagram

00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:36.990
is actually there's a natural
generalization to the loop

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.190
diagrams.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.930
And then just include
the loops here.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.655
For example, here, you can
do something like this.

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:54.405
Now you can also have
something like this.

00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:01.120
So that's, of course,
one and two, including

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.810
the fluctuations, are
under the saddle point,

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:08.538
are including the fluctuation
around the saddle point.

00:41:13.722 --> 00:41:15.180
Any questions
regarding this point?

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.490
Good.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.130
Yes?

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.890
AUDIENCE: So when people draw
these like so-called Witten

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.825
diagrams, where they
draw up like this circle.

00:41:35.825 --> 00:41:36.630
HONG LIU: Right.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.030
AUDIENCE: Is that
basically what we're doing?

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.390
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.000
Yeah, right.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.300
Yeah, so let me just
explain one thing.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.130
In the Euclidean, I have been
drawing the ideas like this.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.040
So this is z equal
to 0, et cetera.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.800
So in the Euclidean signature,
as you will do in your PSet,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.240
then this z equal
to infinity, you

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.780
can argue is actually
a single point.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.580
So let me just write
down the metric.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:12.002
So the metric is R
square, z square.

00:42:12.002 --> 00:42:13.460
When you go to
Euclidean signature,

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.000
you just have dx squared.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.900
So this is a full
Euclidean metric.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.289
So there's something
interesting about the difference

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:23.830
between the Euclidean
and Lorentzian,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:27.700
even though, from this
picture, it's roughly the same.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.600
So if it's equal to
0, you go to z notch.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.580
And then in the Euclidean
case, you can actually

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.920
show that z equal
infinity, even though,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.224
[? naively, ?] you still
have a full Euclidean plane,

00:42:43.224 --> 00:42:45.390
but you can argue, actually,
that the whole thing is

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.940
actually a point.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.570
And you can roughly see, when
you go to z equals infinity,

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:54.560
the overall factor goes to 0.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:00.160
So essentially, the whole
space shrinks to a point.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.280
The whole space
shrinks to a point.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.500
So in Euclidean, if
it's equal to infinity,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.220
it's essentially a point.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.100
And then topologically, this
is equivalent to having a disk.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.360
Topologically, the whole
space is just disk.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.670
And the z equal to infinity
is one point on the boundary.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.125
And then the other
is z equal to 0.

00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:28.890
And so this is the
interior of the space.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:33.640
Yes?

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.265
AUDIENCE: So in other words, the
entire perimeter of the circle

00:43:36.265 --> 00:43:37.054
is identi--

00:43:37.054 --> 00:43:38.220
HONG LIU: It's the boundary.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:38.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.311
HONG LIU: Yeah, this
is the boundary.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:48.727
Essentially, you can imagine,
each point here is R to d.

00:43:48.727 --> 00:43:50.185
Then you add the
point at infinity,

00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:51.514
and then it becomes a sphere.

00:43:51.514 --> 00:43:52.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.610
HONG LIU: Yeah, it
becomes a sphere.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.240
And then the whole thing
becomes like a disk.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.046
So normally, when people
will draw-- so topologically,

00:44:07.046 --> 00:44:08.670
you're creating a
disk, just like this.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.680
Then people will just
draw diagrams like this.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.434
Yeah, I draw diagrams like this.

00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:21.200
AUDIENCE: If you add a
single point to the boundary,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.110
that single point is equal to
infinity to the boundary, which

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.010
is z equals 0?

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.220
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.440
AUDIENCE: You mean that you
have a point that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.210
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.310
Yeah, this point turns
out, it can actually

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.780
lie on the boundary.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.215
AUDIENCE: But then, on the
boundary, the value of t

00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:42.470
is not continuous.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.730
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.230
Yeah.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.430
So this is due to the
coordinate choice.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:59.200
It's just this coordinate
becomes singular at that point.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.437
You can rewrite it.

00:45:01.437 --> 00:45:04.020
Yeah, the simplest thing is that
you rewrite these [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.900
coordinates to the coordinate
which has a parameter that has

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.610
a boundary really as a sphere.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:09.680
And then you will see it.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.860
Because when you write
the sphere as a plane,

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.220
then this one point
becomes singular.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.634
This is just the standard story.

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:19.300
Just that coordinate
choice is singular.

00:45:23.047 --> 00:45:23.880
Any other questions?

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.450
Good.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:37.410
So this is the first remark.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:44.960
The secondary
remark is that this

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.260
is a little bit of an
unusual correlation function.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.010
So this is the bulk
correlation functions,

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.830
but with all points
lying on the boundary.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:10.650
So the counterpart or
just the exact analog

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:33.110
of standard flat-space
correlation functions in AdS--

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:46.882
you can see the end
bulk point and look

00:46:46.882 --> 00:46:48.090
at its correlation functions.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:57.345
So this then will be really just
bring you to the standard QFT

00:46:57.345 --> 00:46:59.530
one correlation functions.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:07.620
Then you have endpoints, z1,
x1, or in the bulk, z2, x2, et

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.320
cetera.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:14.380
And then you just draw a
diagram between them, et cetera.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.000
The area propagator
here would be

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.250
just bulk-to-bulk propagator.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.819
There's no boundary-to-bulk
propagator.

00:47:19.819 --> 00:47:21.610
There's no boundary-to-bulk
propagator just

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.767
all bulk-to-bulk propagator.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.876
So this is a complete analog of
your ordinary flat-space Green

00:47:36.876 --> 00:47:37.375
functions.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:46.420
But we can easily imagine that
this correlation function must

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.634
be related to those
correlations functions

00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:51.550
if you just take those
points to the boundary.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:33.670
So it's natural to expect, say,
those correlations functions,

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.150
since they're at
the boundary, must

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:43.340
be related to those kind
of standard correlation

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:48.550
functions, in which you would
take the point to the boundary.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.091
So those, somehow, in the
end, must be the same.

00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:08.840
So if I take those
points to the boundary,

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.230
I should recover that guy.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:20.040
So indeed, this
relation is true.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.860
And you will work it out
yourself in the PSet.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.510
You see, the only
difference is the following.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:33.920
When you take those points
to the boundary, what you get

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920
is the boundary limit.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:44.160
So now let's imagine you take
those points to the boundary.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.106
Because here, it's
all bulk propagator.

00:49:47.106 --> 00:49:49.230
So those propagator, which
connect to the boundary,

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.170
would be the boundary limit
of the bulk propagator.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.940
And then, it just
boils down to, what

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.440
is the relation
between the boundary

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.742
limit of the bulk
propagator and this boundary

00:50:00.742 --> 00:50:01.700
to the bulk propagator?

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:15.157
So the above relation-- let
me just-- I'd rather just

00:50:15.157 --> 00:50:18.630
call it a number.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.350
So this star-star-star
just boils

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:36.183
down to the relation
between the k

00:50:36.183 --> 00:50:42.950
z, x, x prime, which is our
boundary-to-bulk propagator,

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:55.860
and limit z prime goes to
0, G x, z, x prime, z prime.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.420
So you will find
that these two guys

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.660
are proportional to each other.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:11.190
And once you extract out
that proportional factor,

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:15.220
then you just relate them.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:21.690
So this is just another
way to calculate.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.690
Because this is the bounty
correlation function.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.110
So this is the boundary
correlation function.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:30.960
So this is related to the
CFT correlation functions.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.970
And then you can also calculate
the CFT correlation function

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.205
just by taking the limit of
the bulk correlation functions.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:44.080
So this you will work
out a little bit.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.200
Yeah, you will work out the
precise relation in your PSet.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.790
Maybe some of you have
looked at it already.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.904
So any questions on this?

00:51:53.904 --> 00:51:56.264
AUDIENCE: What is the
advantage of maybe

00:51:56.264 --> 00:51:59.580
using another to express it?

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.510
HONG LIU: Yeah, just different
ways of calculating things.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:07.510
And of course, normally,
I have many different ways

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:09.310
to calculate things.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.301
Some of them may be
convenient this way.

00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:13.675
So of them may be convenient
for that purpose, et cetera.

00:52:13.675 --> 00:52:14.230
It depends.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.960
Normally, we just
directly are using

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.196
the bulk-to-boundary propagator.

00:52:21.196 --> 00:52:23.820
If you just do the calculation,
the bulk-to boundary propagator

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.980
actually is simpler.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.130
But sometimes, for certain
conceptual questions,

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.520
this actually becomes simpler.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:39.518
So now let's look
at Wilson loops.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.140
So how do you calculate the
Wilson loops using gravity?

00:52:53.640 --> 00:53:02.140
So in the gauge
theory-- so I assume

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.490
you have already done the
QFT II and the gauge theory?

00:53:10.645 --> 00:53:12.789
In the gauge
theory, we also know

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:15.080
it's essentially one of the
most important observables.

00:53:18.715 --> 00:53:21.090
The Wilson loop is normally
defined in the following way.

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.352
So now I will
explain my notation.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.400
So let me also add
in subscript r here.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.910
So c is a closed path.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.320
So this is defined
for closed paths.

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:58.720
And A mu is a matrix.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.960
So we can see the
[INAUDIBLE] in gauge theory.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.750
A mu is a matrix, writing
the standard away,

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.940
in terms of the generator,
in some representations r.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.140
So this is in some
representations.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.140
So this is just the
generators of the gauge

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:26.750
group in some representation,
which we'll call r.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.550
And P is the path ordering.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.330
So in general, you can choose
any representations you want.

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:17.665
But often, we choose r, say,
in fundamental representations.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.250
For example, that's
normally what we do, in QCD,

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.170
in fundamental representation.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.695
But you can choose it to
be any representation.

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.644
So the physical meaning
of this, so this operator,

00:55:39.644 --> 00:55:41.060
by definition, is
gauge invariant,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.930
because of this trace.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.840
And need the path ordering,
because you have a matrix here.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.420
And the matrix, at different
points, don't commute.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.550
So you need to specify ordering.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.900
And so you just specify it
by the order of the path.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:05.180
And so the physical
meaning of the Wilson loop,

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:19.240
so this is essentially the
phase factor associated

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:38.640
with transporting an
external particle, in a given

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:44.220
representation, say, in r
representation, along c.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.480
So you transport the
particle along some path.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.600
And you come back
to the same point.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.840
Then you find that that
phase does not necessarily

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.890
go back to 0.

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.680
And so this is a
nontrivial phase.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.346
It essentially tells you there's
a nontrivial gauge field there.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.480
Yeah, so this provides a
probe of the gauge fields.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:15.980
Yes?

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.354
AUDIENCE: I know
that people talk

00:57:17.354 --> 00:57:19.519
about-- I know that it's
somehow and observable.

00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:20.810
But is it actually observable ?

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.428
Can you actually
do an experiment

00:57:22.428 --> 00:57:23.518
to measure this phase?

00:57:27.496 --> 00:57:28.620
HONG LIU: I don't think so.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.119
Ha.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.385
It depends.

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:48.460
Yeah, in some
situations, you can.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:56.900
Let me mention something
else, then the answer

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.250
to this question will be seen.

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:06.840
So the simplest case
would be the W c, just

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:11.800
the single-point function
of W c, say, in a vacuum.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.060
So this is the
simplest observable.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:19.310
But of course, you can also
consider the generic, say,

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.700
a large number, several
[? routes ?] in some general

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.950
state, say, for example,
[? finite ?] [? telemetry ?],

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:24.450
et cetera.

00:58:27.199 --> 00:58:28.740
So these are the
typical observables.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:34.330
So now let me emphasize
this external.

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:40.470
So this external
is very important.

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:44.880
So normally, by calling
something external,

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.950
we mean that this particle
has infinite mass.

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:49.290
It's infinitely heavy.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.550
And the reason we want
it to be infinitely heavy

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:57.500
is because only for
heavy particles,

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.130
in principle, you can
localize the lower path.

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:05.040
Then you can make mathematical
sense of the precise path.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.530
Otherwise, if it's a
fluctuating particle,

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:14.004
then you can not specify a
path-- yeah, ambiguously.

00:59:14.004 --> 00:59:15.920
So when we say, an
external particle, I always

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.294
say a particle which is assumed
to be infinitely massive.

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:29.480
And also, I've
introduced terminology.

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.290
When this r is in the
fundamental representation--

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.740
yeah, maybe not right here.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.070
When this r is in the
fundamental representation,

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:43.060
we'll call the corresponding
particle a quark.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.415
If it is in the
fundamental representation,

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.950
I will call it a quark.

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:51.657
I will often just consider the
fundamental representation.

00:59:51.657 --> 00:59:53.740
In the phase factor, where
we're corresponding to,

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.000
you transport a quark.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:18.930
So one of the very often used
loops is a rectangular loop.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:25.920
So this is along some
spatial direction,

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.710
so this is the time direction.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.562
So let's say the
spatial direction is L,

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.270
and the time direction,
using the length,

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:39.020
is T. So imagine you
have a loop like this.

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.902
So normally, we can
see that the T, say,

01:01:13.902 --> 01:01:15.777
the length of the loop
in the time direction,

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:19.200
is much, much
greater than the L.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.620
So in such a limit,
then, essentially,

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.660
you can ignore the
contribution from this side,

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.970
from these two short sides.

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:36.650
So in the limit, in which
this T goes to infinity,

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:40.085
to leading order, you can
ignore the short side.

01:01:40.085 --> 01:01:43.930
And then you can
think of this loop

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:47.164
when it just has a particle--
so this is a particle moving

01:01:47.164 --> 01:01:47.830
forward in time.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.690
This is a particle
going backward in time.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.520
Then you can consider this as
a particle and an anti-particle

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.670
moving forward in time.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.830
So in this case, we can
argue, on general grounds,

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.510
that this will just,
to leading order,

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:07.350
will give you something iET.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:10.320
And this e, it just
can be interpreted

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:31.680
as a potential energy between a
single quark and an anti-quark.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.304
So in this example,
this is the same.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:47.720
In this case, you may be able
to measure this Wilson loop,

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.095
because if you can
measure-- experimentally,

01:02:51.095 --> 01:02:53.975
you may be able to measure
this energy between the two

01:02:53.975 --> 01:02:54.475
particles.

01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:01.930
And then, essentially, you can
say, I have measured the loop.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.305
And then you can compare with
the prediction of the loop.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:16.574
So again, in order to make
this interpretation make sense,

01:03:16.574 --> 01:03:18.865
this particle having infinite
energy is very important.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.720
And again, only for the
very heavy particle,

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.420
you can really
localize them, and then

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.850
talk about the potential energy
between these two particles.

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.160
Otherwise, if they
fluctuate a lot,

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.815
then it's hard to
make it precise.

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:44.340
So now the question is how do we
calculate this quantity in AdS?

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.170
When I don't put an index
here, I just mean that this

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:15.573
the fundamental representation.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.000
The question is how we do that.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.850
So in order to
answer this question,

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:50.176
we first need to
understand how to introduce

01:04:50.176 --> 01:05:07.685
a fundamental external particle,
external quark in the N

01:05:07.685 --> 01:05:09.060
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.708
So how to introduce a
fundamental external quark

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:23.457
in the N equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.600
So we know, as we
discussed before,

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.340
that everything in the N equals
4 super Yang-Mills theory, so

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.295
all fundamental fields,
all the fields in the N

01:05:36.295 --> 01:05:37.670
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory,

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:40.360
they are in a joint
representation.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.090
There's nothing in the
fundamental representation.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.530
Everything is in the
joint representation.

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:50.287
So first we need to introduce
a fundamental object,

01:05:50.287 --> 01:05:52.620
an object we transform under
fundamental representation.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:01.350
After we have done that, then we
need to translate that quantity

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:02.260
to the gravity side.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:19.082
And then we understand how
the gravity description

01:06:19.082 --> 01:06:20.290
of such an external particle.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:41.870
So this is easy to do.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:43.355
This is easy to do.

01:06:43.355 --> 01:06:45.820
So let's first think about
how to do this in the N

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.050
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory.

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.640
And then this is a
very intuitive by using

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.860
this [INAUDIBLE] picture.

01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:01.180
So we know the N equals
4 super Yang-Mills

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.860
theory comes from low-energy
theory of N D3-branes.

01:07:07.834 --> 01:07:10.000
They come from the low-energy
theory of N D3-branes.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.500
So how do we introduce
an external particles?

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:36.080
So now let's imagine,
consider N plus 1 of them,

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.780
and let me separate
one from the rest.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:49.320
So this is still N,
separate one from the rest.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.860
So then there can be open
string connects between them.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.890
So suppose I separate
them by some distance, r,

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.080
in the transverse
direction to the D3-brane.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:12.180
So as we described before, such
as a separation breaks the SU N

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:19.380
plus 1 symmetry of
the D3-brane SU N

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:25.439
and then a single
U1 of this 1-brane.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:39.390
In particular, such
an open string--

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.424
so let's look at the endpoint.

01:08:41.424 --> 01:08:43.715
Then the endpoint of this
string can only have indices.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.102
Because this is a
single stream, one

01:08:49.102 --> 01:08:50.310
end ending on the other side.

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.180
There's only one index.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.760
And here, they can only
have N possible index.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:09.279
So such a fundamental
string transforms

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:10.760
in the fundamental
representation.

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:23.569
So from the point of view
of this SU N gauge theory,

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:25.270
this is a quark.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.829
So this endpoint is a quark.

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:28.620
So this is a quark.

01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:46.060
And the mass of this
quark is equal to-- so let

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:52.960
me call the mass capital
M-- is equal to r,

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.439
the length between them divided
by tension of the string.

01:09:58.439 --> 01:09:59.730
So this we have derived before.

01:10:02.126 --> 01:10:04.000
So this just gives you
the mass of the quark.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.390
So when you separate one
D-brane from the other,

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.840
so you have introduced
this quark, with a mass.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.190
So now let's consider that
there's no low-energy limit

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:24.690
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:56.960
So in the low-energy
limit of [INAUDIBLE],

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.944
so we want to keep this
quark, so there, of course,

01:11:03.944 --> 01:11:05.485
you want to take
alpha prime go to 0.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.770
But we want to keep this quark
in the low-energy spectrum,

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.350
because we want
this to remain in N

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:16.725
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory,

01:11:16.725 --> 01:11:19.250
because we want to
introduce this particle.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:23.950
So in this low-energy limit,
when we take off a prime,

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:26.900
go to 0 limit, we also want
to take, at the same time,

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:33.740
r goes to 0 limit, so that this
mass term, r divided by alpha

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.605
prime, will remain finite.

01:11:40.616 --> 01:11:44.920
Then that means
this will remain,

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.450
this particle, such kind of
fundamental representation,

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:51.438
will remain in the N equals
4 super Yang-Mills theory.

01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.311
Because other modes are massive.

01:12:00.311 --> 01:12:02.060
And then when alpha
prime goes to 0 limit,

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.530
it goes to infinity.

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:06.065
And under those modes,
we will remain with the N

01:12:06.065 --> 01:12:07.440
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory.

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:12.345
So now let's see what
happens on the gravity side.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.250
So here, you will need to
fill in some details yourself.

01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:23.860
I'll only tell you the answer.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.720
On the gravity side, you
have this N D3-brane.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.680
They have one brane which
[? is ?] [? r ?] separated from

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.580
this N D3-brane.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.420
And they're separation
is such that, when

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.230
you take off alpha
prime and go to 0 limit,

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.320
their ratio is finite.

01:12:54.894 --> 01:12:56.310
Now, in the gravity
side, you have

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:59.580
to take this so-called
near-horizon limit,

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.220
with taking into account.

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:13.130
So what you find in the
gravity side is that,

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:34.110
as before, that N D3-brane now
disappeared into r equal to 0.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:38.460
Remember, r equal to 0 is that
infinite proper distance away.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.060
And now we are using
this r coordinate.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.380
And when we take
this low limit, we're

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.040
using this r coordinate
rather than this z coordinate.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.180
So in that case, you
have i equal infinity.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.950
Then the brane, essentially,
goes to r equal to 0.

01:13:57.964 --> 01:13:59.380
which has infinite
proper distance

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:04.510
away from any finite r.

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:10.310
So now this is an
exercise for yourself just

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:14.700
to repeat our previous argument.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.050
Then you will find that
in this regime, when

01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:21.300
you take alpha prime
go to 0, this r finite,

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.640
this D3-brane does
not disappear.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.900
The single D3-brane
will remain in the AdS.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.270
So the difference, from
our previous story,

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:42.450
is that, in addition
to the AdS, now

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:48.450
you have an additional
D3-brane at some point in S5.

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:51.170
Because D3-brane is in
some transverse direction,

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.910
which now become S5.

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:55.760
So you have a D3-brane,
which is parallel

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.240
to the boundary coordinates,
but sitting at one point in S5.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.370
And I think this
picture is reasonable,

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.420
but you should check yourself.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.960
Because in this regime, this
D3-brane does not go away.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:19.800
And a remarkable thing
you will check yourself

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.571
is that when you take
the [INAUDIBLE] limit,

01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:24.070
in this picture,
this is flat-space.

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:31.300
Then you have this formula.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.130
And now, when you take this
limit, this now become AdS.

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:44.210
Now, this AdS at some radius
r, controlled by this r.

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.890
And now you can
check one nice thing.

01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:59.390
In AdS, if you consider a
string, straight string,

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:03.420
from this D3-brane all
the way to r equal to 0,

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.010
which is this
string, this string

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.510
has exactly the same mass.

01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:15.250
So the mass is equal to r
divided by 2 pi alpha prime--

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.590
also in AdS5.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.290
So this is a consistency check.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.580
Because when you take the
low-energy limits, of course,

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.670
you should not change the mass.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.055
The mass of the string
will not change.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:35.430
The only question is whether
it will stay in the spectrum

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:37.920
or will not stay in the
low-energy spectrum.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.350
The mass will not change.

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:41.540
And you will see that
when you take that limit,

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.130
you find this
D3-brane remains here.

01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:50.410
And this string, which now will
connect some r to r equal to 0,

01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:54.140
which is now just some AdS.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.240
This is just some interior
or AdS, infinite proper

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.460
distance away.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.250
And then you can
check that, in the AdS

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:11.660
metric, the image of this brane,
viewed from the boundary time--

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.900
you have to this ratio
factor, et cetera--

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.022
remains exactly equal to this.

01:17:18.022 --> 01:17:19.980
So this is an important
self-consistency check,

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:23.390
which I will not do here.

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:24.860
So now, the story
becomes simple.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:34.180
Now we generate such a string,
such a fundamental particle

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.880
with such a mass.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:50.660
But in order to introduce an
external particle-- in order

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:55.070
to have an external particle
take a mass to go to infinity,

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.070
so that means we need to
take r goes to infinity.

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:00.435
So that means we
want to this D3-brane

01:18:00.435 --> 01:18:02.400
to lie on the boundary of AdS.

01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:13.765
So to summarize, now we want to
move this D3-brane-- in order

01:18:13.765 --> 01:18:15.744
for the external
particle, we want

01:18:15.744 --> 01:18:17.410
to take M goes to
infinity, then we want

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:18.600
to take r goes to infinity.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.610
So we want this
D3-brane to actually lie

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.590
on the boundary of AdS.

01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:25.423
So let us just
conclude, summarize.

01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:45.250
An external quark
with infinite mass,

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:51.550
in N equals 4 super
Yang-Mills theory,

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:57.300
is described by a string
ending on the boundary of AdS.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.590
So this is r equal to infinity.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.777
Because now, we have put in
this D3-brane to the boundary,

01:19:06.777 --> 01:19:08.901
and then we'll, of course,
run into a string ending

01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:09.882
on the boundary of AdS.

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.950
A external quark with
[INAUDIBLE] AdS, of course,

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:31.516
run into a string ending
at boundary of AdS.

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.390
And in particular, the
location of the string

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.470
can be mapped to the
location of the quark.

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:45.931
So then endpoint of the string
is the location of the quark.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.550
So now we have found a very
nice picture that introduces

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.530
a fundamental quark, in N equals
4 super Yang-Mills theory,

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.490
because [? what you ?]
[? need  to ?] [? do with ?]

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:03.073
such a string.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:08.740
And now, when you
do a Wilson loop,

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:17.440
then corresponding to transport
this string around some path,

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.700

WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Good morning. Yeah.
All right. Good.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Something to
counteract the rainy

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
days we
have here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All right. Today we're going to
make a very important transition.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The transition goes
back to this picture.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Of course, what
we want to do is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
understand biological function by
taking our two favorite approaches.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Understanding the organism
minus an individual gene.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Understanding an organism
minus an individual component,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and understanding the individual
components minus the organism,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
genetics and biochemistry. And,
as we know, the geneticist went off

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on their route finding mutants,
doing mutant hunts, making crosses,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
making genetic maps, et cetera,
didn't understand really what these

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
genes had to do with anything
specific in the organism,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
other than they produced
phenotypes when they were mutated.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the biochemist went
off purifying enzymes,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
working on biochemical
pathways, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We began to see some connection when
we talked a bit about the mutants

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that affect the ability to make
arginine and the fact that they

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
could encode different enzymatic
steps. And, in particular,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I highlighted the work of
Archibald Garrett who really,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
right at the start of the century,
recognized that somehow genetic

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
mutations were responsible for
somehow affecting the production of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
enzymes in important
biochemical pathways.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, that was sort of one connection
of genetics into protein but still a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
rather tenuous one. The real
next step to connect these

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
two would be to do the
biochemistry of genes. So,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
how would a biochemist approach
heredity? A biochemist would grind

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
up the organism,
fractionate it in different

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
components, and attempt to
find heredity, purify heredity,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
get like a pure solution of
heredity. And that's nuts, right?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The notion that you could purify
heredity as a biochemical entity

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because like how would you
know you had it? But, of course,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that's exactly what happened.
That is what happened, was

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
biochemistry developed sufficiently
far that folks were actually able to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
purify substances, not
just that could digest a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
particular sugar or substances
that might, you know,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
like slide by each other
like actinomycins of muscles,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but substances that were actually
heredity. And that began the real

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
unification of those, and
that's the point of today.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And that is the field of molecular
biology. And we're going to cover

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
tremendous territory in unifying
these two different fields.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
OK. So, let's dive right in.
The discovery of the transforming

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
principle. It's a
wonderfully old-fashioned

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
kind of word. Nobody would
use language like this today.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The discovery of the
transforming principle. So,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this starts, this shaggy dog story
starts in about 1928 with the work

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of Griffiths. Griffiths had no
particular interest in DNA or

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
genetics or biochemistry
for that matter.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Griffith was interested in bacteria.
He wanted to understand bacteria.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And, in particular, he
studied pneumococcus bacteria,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which could infect and kill mice.
And he was very interested in the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
mechanism by with these
pneumococci could kill mice.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, it turns out that the
pneumococcus bacteria came in two

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
different types.
One, the bacteria,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
when they grew on a Petri plate,
produced a glistening, smooth, shiny

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
colony. We'll call them
smooth bacteria here.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And these bacteria, in
addition to being smooth and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
glistening, were virulent.
That is, if you inject into the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
mouse, these bacteria would kill the
mouse. They are smooth because they

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
have this encapsulating
polysaccharide coat around them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And it's not necessarily the case
that that's what makes them virulent,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
although it actually does have a
role in that, but it is the case

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that they're smooth and
they're virulent. So,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you inject in a mouse, mouse
dies because the mouse is not

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
resistant to these bacteria. By
contrast, there were strains of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
pneumococcus that were rough.
They did not have the same kind of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
a polysaccharide coat, and
therefore they had a very rough

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
appearance. They
didn't glisten.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And these were non-virulent. If
you inject these into the mouse,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the mouse immune system was able
to fight these particular rough

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
bacteria. OK. So,
Griffith did the obvious

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
experiments. So,
take some bacteria,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
we'll take some smooth
virulent bacteria, we'll inject

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
into a mouse. And
what will happen?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The mouse will die. This is one of
the easier assays in the laboratory.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It's the feet up, feet down
assay, you have a dead mouse.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OK. Number two. Then
take the rough bacteria,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
inject it into a
mouse, what happens?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sorry? It lives. The mouse
lives because these are

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
non virulent. OK. Now,
let's just do some simple

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
controls. Let's take the smooth
bacteria and autoclave them,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
heat them up to very high
temperature to kill them.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
How will we know they're dead?
You try plating them out. They

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
don't grow anymore,
so they're dead.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, take heat killed, and
you can verify in the lab that

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
they're killed,
heat killed smooth,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
check that they really were heat
killed, inject them into the mouse.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And what happens? It lives
because, I mean, they're bacteria,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
right? OK. Last of all we take the
utterly harmless rough bacteria,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
plus the utterly harmless
heat-killed smooth bacteria,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we inject them into the
mouse, and what happens?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It dies. That is a notable result
because the rough bacteria alone

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
will not kill this mouse and the
smooth bacteria that have been

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
heat-killed will not kill this mouse,
but together they killed the mouse.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is very puzzling. What
was even more puzzling was

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
when you autopsied the mouse,
you can isolate from that mouse

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
smooth, virulent, live
bacteria, but you didn't put

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
any in. Very strange. So,
this actually yields live

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
smooth virulent bacteria despite
not having put any in there.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Virulent bacteria. Somehow
we were able to create

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
smooth and virulent bacteria
notwithstanding not having put any

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in here. So, of course,
Griffith then attempted to say,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
well, what was it that
allowed this to happen?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, he could try putting in dead
rough bacteria with dead smooth

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
bacteria. That doesn't do anything.
You need to have something alive.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So, you've got to have live rough
bacteria. You can then say let me

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
take the dead virulent bacteria and
start fractionating it biochemically

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and asking what fraction of that
material from the dead bacteria

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
allows us to recover, to have
this property of being able

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to now produce virulent
bacteria that killed the mice?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And do you realize how utterly
tedious and painful that

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
experiment is? You
take the dead bacteria,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you fractionate it into lots of
different biochemical fractions.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
For each fraction, how do you
test whether it has the property?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You've got to shoot up a bunch
of mice. This is a very tedious

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
procedure. I mean it is, you
know, you can't underestimate

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
how important the assay is, how
important it is to come up with

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
easy ways to do things in order
to be able to accelerate progress.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Griffith tried hard and roughly
began to purify fractions and get

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
information about what the
fractions were. But, in fact,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
this work really never did
lead to a clear conclusion.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But it did tell people that
there was some material,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
which got named The Transforming
Principle. This is almost like an

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
old alchemical kind of word,
a principle being a particular

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
chemical composition of matter,
which if you don't know what it is

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you call it The Living
Principle or something like that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, what was this
transforming principle?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Well, it really took work
about 15 years later by Avery,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
McCarty and MacLeod to sort this out.
What Avery, McCarty and MacLeod did

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
was the same experiment
basically, except minus the mice.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
What they found was you
could take the dead bacteria,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
combine it, the dead virulent
bacteria, the dead smooth bacteria,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
combine it with the live rough
bacteria, and by combining it in the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
right way in a test tube you would
be able to plate it out on a Petri

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
plate and see smooth
bacteria come out.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Sans mouse. So, they
didn't need the mouse.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This dramatically accelerated work
because if you're able to just take

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
fractions of the dead bacteria,
add it to the live bacteria and look

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
for the presence of some smooth
bacteria coming out of it,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
you would be able to work much
more quickly. And they did.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And they began purifying. And
they began purifying and they

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
tried to isolate the fraction that
contained this new ability to make

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
these bacteria acquire a new
property. And they knew that they

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
were transforming the
heredity of this bacterium.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They were transforming the
traits of this bacterium.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They were, in fact,
transmitting heredity.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And they purified and purified
and purified. And eventually,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
testing many, many fractions and
making them purer and purer and

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
purer and purer, they
found that consistently the

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
fraction that contained heredity
was the fraction that contained DNA.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now, it was a lot more work than
that because no fraction is pure.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
DNA is in multiple
fractions. But, you know,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
they kept trying to purify
it. And it sure looked like the

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
transforming principle. The
property of being able to

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
transform was co-purifying
along with the DNA fraction.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And you know what the
reaction to that was? Well,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
mostly it was that they must have
goofed because all smart right

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
thinking people knew that DNA
was an absolutely boring molecule.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Because the interesting molecule
at this time was proteins.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Everybody knew there were zillions,
there were 20 amino acids, they came

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in zillions of combinations,
they had all sorts of different

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
shapes and properties, and
hydrophobic ones, hydrophilic

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
ones that are enzymes. And,
clearly, anything as important

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
as heredity was not going to be
encoded in some utterly boring

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
structural molecule that was just
a long polymer of four virtually

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
identical units. And so,
the sort of reaction was

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
this is interesting but
there must be some trick,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
something must be wrong in
this experiment, give or take.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now, why did people think
that DNA was so boring?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Now, DNA had been known for
a long time, since the 1860s.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Lots of molecules were known, but
why was DNA boring and why were

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
proteins kind of exciting? So,
for that, we really do have to

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
look some more closely
at the structure of DNA.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I want to review the structure of
DNA here because we're going to use

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
it a lot. So, DNA
has three components,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as you undoubtedly know.
It has first a sugar,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:43.000
or almost sugar, two prime
deoxyribose, two prime deoxyribose,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so it's a pentose, or almost the
deoxypentose. And its structure,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and this is an important structure.
In order to be a true sugar,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to be ribose you would have a
hydroxyl. Deoxyribose just has a

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
hydrogen there. And the
way we number these carbons

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
around this five carbon sugar are
very important and we'll always talk

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
about them, the one prime, two
prime, three prime, four prime

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and five prime carbons
of this deoxyribose.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And you'll notice that it's the
two prime carbon that is dioxi.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, that's the sugar. The next
important component as we build up

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
DNA is the base, OK?
The base is put here.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, I'm going to start
simplifying our sugar.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Base. So, there are four kinds
of bases that can go here.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And they are adenine,
guanine, thymine, cytosine.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So, that's the second important
part of building up DNA.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The third important part in
building up DNA is to make the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
monomers that are used to
produce DNA, we need to put on

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:07.000
a triphosphate. And he we
go. We'll take our sugar

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:22.000
here, our base over here, and
then off this carbon we have our

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:35.000
phosphate. And we
have a triphosphate.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:46.000
There we go. So, this is the
monomer that is used to build up DNA.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This guy here is called
a nucleoside, note the S.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
This guy here with the triphosphate
on it is called a nucleotide.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It's not usually written with
such a big capital letter,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but nonetheless I point this
out. And, obviously, what is this

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
triphosphate going to do for us?
It's going to provide the energy to

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
allow us to make DNA polymer chains.
We're going to do a dehydration

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
synthesis where we break two of
those phosphates off and use it for

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
the energy to be able to
catalyze DNA chains to be made.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
OK. Now, when you combine
nucleotides into a DNA strand you do

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000
so to create a sugar phosphate
backbone. And you'll see for many

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
molecules, I don't care that
you know their structures

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
terribly well. But for
the basic structure of DNA,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
including its sugar phosphate
backbone, it's going to be important

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:21.000
for all that we talk about. So,
what happens is we have a chain

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
of DNA growing like this,
and we have our OH here.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
We have our base here.
And which carbon is this?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Five prime, that's right. OK.
Which carbon is this? This one.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Great. That's the three
prime, two prime, one prime.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Great. OK. To this three prime
carbon we add this triphosphate

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000
breaking off two phosphates there.
The diphosphate gets broken off,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the pyrophosphate. And we get a
single phosphate linkage to the next

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.000
subunit of the chain.
So, here we go phosphate,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
sugar, phosphate, sugar.
And if we ignore these bases,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
which, you know, who cares about the
bases anyway, what we have is just

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
phosphate, sugar,
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
sugar, phosphate, sugar. OK?
So, it's a very simple structure.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
There's nothing hard to remember
about this. And the phosphate is

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
always attached to the three prime
carbon of the preceding sugar and to

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
the five prime carbon
of the next sugar.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
OK? So, we often speak of chains of
DNA growing from the five prime end

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
to the three prime end. And
that confuses non-molecular

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
biologists to no end.
What are we talking about,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
five prime ends and three prime ends?
This is what we're talking about.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
But the additions are catalyzed
onto the three prime carbon of that

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
sugar. It grows at it three
prime end. So, you have sugar,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,
sugar, phosphate. So, that's it.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We're all done. Well,
there are the bases,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I guess, too, right? So,
we'll mention these bases.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
The bases are, they come in
two types. There are purines.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Adenine and guanine are purines.
And there's a six member rings with

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
a five member ring. And
there are two bases that are

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
called pyrimidines, they
are smaller, the thymine and

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the cytosine. And there are six
member rings. And they have some

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
carbon, some nitrogen, some
oxygen and some hydrogen.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But, you've got to admit
that compared to proteins,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
this is pretty boring. It's
just one long sugar phosphate

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
chain. And
two purines,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
slightly bigger things, two
pyrimidines, slightly smaller

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
things. Very similar structures for
these two. I haven't even bothered

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
to focus on the difference. And
as compared to the richness of

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
proteins, there's just no way
anything interesting could happen

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
with this. That was certainly
the thinking at the time.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You have to understand
how important prior ideas,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
prior prejudice is to science.
People look at it and say this must

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
be some structural
molecule. It is scaffolding.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
It's like the studs in the wall
of the house you're building or

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
something like that.
Not too interesting.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So, what happens? Well, you
know, it takes time to sort

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
things out. People come back
to this problem. Any thoughts?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I mean I've given you one reason
why this did not make a huge impact,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
because it was, you know, DNA was
kind of a boring molecule and people

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
weren't really sure this was
right. It could be an artifact,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
right? Maybe some important protein
had come along for the ride with the

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
DNA faction, right? What's
another reason why people

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
might not have paid tremendous
attention to this result?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Sorry? It was just bacteria.
Anything else? Couldn't imagine,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
right, how this DNA could encode
the enzyme. Anything else? Date.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's in the middle of the Second
World War. Maybe people had more

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
important things to do,
right? So, this is right in the

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
middle of the Second World War,
too. It's just worth noting that

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
these guys are working in the middle
of New York City at the Rockefeller

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Institute and it's in the
middle of the Second World War.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Anyway, war is over and
some work continues on this.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And the work takes a
somewhat different attack.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Instead of working bacteria it now
is, there's work here on certain

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
bacterial viruses.
So, instead, see,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
bacteria get their own here.
Instead of using bacteria to infect

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
mice, Hershey and Chase, and
others at the time, used viruses

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
to infect bacteria. So,
here the bacterium is the

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
victim. And people had found
and had studied these amazingly

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
interesting really tiny things
that could affect a bacterium

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
and kill it. These particles
that had these funny

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
shapes were called bacteriophage.
What does phage mean? To eat.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Bacteria eaters.
Bacteriophages were these little

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
viruses. They were incredibly tiny.
You could filter them through very

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
small filters. And, yet,
when you added them to

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
bacteria they would
kill the bacteria.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
These were very simple things.
I'm reluctant to call them

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
creatures. Are they alive? This
is a favorite question people

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
would like to debate.
They say are viruses alive?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And the answer is who cares? I
mean it depends on what you want

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
to define alive to mean. To
me it's not alive in that it

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
cannot replicate on its own without
a host, so I won't call it alive.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
But, anyway, I'll refer to them
loosely as these creatures that eat

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
bacteria. They were very simple.
And all they really had in them was

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
some DNA in their capsid,
this capsid up here, and some

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
protein. But they could
attach to a bacterium

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
and after a certain amount of time
cause the bacteria to burst open and

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
produce lots of daughter-phage,
lots of daughter bacteriophage. It

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
could replicate
within this bacteria.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So, somehow this, while I
might not want to call it

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
alive, certainly can reproduce
itself, or at least with the help of

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
a bacterium can reproduce itself.
When people first discovered this

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
bacteriophage, what do
you think they wanted to do

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
with them? Sorry?
Yeah. Where? In humans.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
The first thought about what to
do with bacteriophage were a whole

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
bunch of interesting Russians who
wanted to make up large quantities

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
of bacteriophage and
have people drink them.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So, they would kill all their
bacteria. And this was the early

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
ideas for antibiotics. It
didn't quite pan out that way.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
But, you know, people have all
these very exciting ideas of,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
wow, I've got something to kill
bacteria, let's pour it down a

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
patient and see if that
does something good for them.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
You know, that's why there are
institutional review boards,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
too, to make sure that you can't
just do that right off the bat.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Somebody else has got
to think about it also.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
It turns out not to be a great
way to kill patients, to kill

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
bacteria, sorry. No,
it doesn't actually kill

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
patients, but it doesn't also kill
the bacteria so well in human beings.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So, anyway. So, the
question was how is it that

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
these viruses kill the bacteria?
Somehow they inject something into

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
the bacteria, something
causes something to happen,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
which causes virus particles to be
made. I don't put too fine a point

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
on it because that's all you
could really say at that point,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
something goes in and
something comes out.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So, what goes in? How
could we tell what goes in?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Yup. By seeing what's left out.
How could we see what's left out?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Just being really practical,
how are we going to tell?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Visually look, but that turns out
to be terribly hard thing to do.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
You've got to have really good eyes
to be able to say the protein is

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
still there but not
the DNA, or the DNA.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Because the thought was if this
thing is injecting its DNA then the

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
DNA must be carrying the
instructions to make phage,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
and this would be
hereditary material. So,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
what we want to show is that the
protein stays out and the DNA goes

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
in. But how is that going to,
how do you do that practically?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Radioactive labeling turns out
to be the best way to do that.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
If we could label radioactively the
DNA with one label and the protein

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
with a different label, we
could see which radioactive

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
isotope goes into the bacteria.
Any candidates for an element that

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
we could use to label DNA
that won't be in protein?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Sorry? I'm sorry? Oh,
who had one? Uranium.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Somebody's thinking World War II
here, right, there would be some

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
spare uranium around. The
problem with that is that DNA

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
does not actually have uranium in
it, and so when you put uranium in it

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
wouldn't still be DNA. We
would like to label it with an

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
element that's actually in DNA.
So the only difference is that it's

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
a radioisotope.
Phosphorus. Phosphorus.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Well, there's obviously phosphorus
in that sugar phosphate backbone.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Is there phosphorus in a typical
amino acid? Any of the 20 amino

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
acids? No phosphorus.
Great. So, we could use a

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
phosphorus isotope. We
could P32 label the DNA.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
But how do make live bacteriophages
that are labeled with radioactive

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
phosphorus? I mean what kind
of fancy chemistry do you

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
need to do that? Yes?
Perfect if you grow the

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
bacteria in radioactively, in
medium. If you grow the virus

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
and the bacteria in medium
that has radioactive phosphate,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
the bacteria and the virus
take care of it for you.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
The phosphate is
automatically incorporated. So,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
you don't have to do any
chemistry. You just feed phosphate,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
radioactive phosphate into the
medium. And the phage that are

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
produced will be
radioactively labeled.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Purify them and use them in
your experiment. Similarly,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
what are we going to
label our proteins with?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Carbon? No. Hydrogen?
No. Oxygen? Nitrogen? No,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
because the bases have nitrogen.
Sulfa. We've only got sulfa.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Where is sulfa going to be?
So, for example, cysteines with

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
thiamines, right, we've
got sulfa. Here's S35.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So, we can take bacteria and
we could, we can take phage,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
and by growing them in the
presence of radioactive DNA,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
no, radioactive phosphorus, P32
and growing them in the presence

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
of radioactive sulfa, S35,
we are about to produce

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
bacteriophage that are labeled.
OK? So, P32, S35. Now we infect

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
bacteria with them. Let
me take a big tube here.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I'm going to add bacteria. I've
got the phage here. The phage

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
particles are attached to the
bacteria and they are going to

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
inject whatever they inject.
Now what do we have to do? We've

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
got to knock off the bacteriophage
particles from the bacteria.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I want to knock them off and see
what is staying with the viral

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
particles and what goes
into the bacteria. So,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
how do I get in there with
tweezers and separate off,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
peel off each virus
from the bacteria?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Washing turns out not to be strong
enough. You've got to previal to

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
get these things off, so you
really need some incredibly

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
strong agitation. So,
specialized devices were used

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
to create intense agitation.
What specialized devices you're

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
aware of that do that?
Blenders. Kitchen blenders.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
The Waring blender turns out to be
the perfect laboratory device for

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
this experiment. And this
is actually known as the

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Waring Blender Experiment.
You take the bacteria with the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
phage attached to it, you let
them attach and do whatever

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
they're going to do, inject
their DNA, as we know turns

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
out is the right answer. And
then you press puree and then

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
vrrrr, and the viral particles fall
off. So, it's important to know how

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
things really happen. So
then what happens is the

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
bacteria are separated
from these particles.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And it turns out these particles are,
the viral particles are much lighter,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
much less dense than the bacteria.
So, how do we separate them?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Centrifuge them.
We centrifuge them.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
The bacterial particles are there
up in the supernatant turn out to be

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
our phage capsids.
And now what do we do?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
We take this stuff, we measure the
radioactivity in the supernatant,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
that is the material that
stays above, and we measure the

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
radioactivity in the pellet.
And what do we end up seeing?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Where does most of the P32,
what shows up in the pellet?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Mostly P32 shows up in the pellet.
Is there no S35 in the pellet? You

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
know, in the textbook story, of
course, there's no S35 because

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
they want it to be nice and clean.
But in reality there's going to be

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
some S35. But it was, you
know, less than 1% of the S35

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
ends up in the pellet. Most
of the S35 stays up here in

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
the supernatant. Does all
of the phosphorus go in?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
No, of course not. Some of the
viruses didn't even attach and not

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
everything goes in. So,
there's still radioactive

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
phosphate up in the supernatant.
But the striking this is that the

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
pellet primarily has gotten
the radioactive phosphorus,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
not the radioactive sulfa, and
therefore we can conclude that

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
what? Well, more DNA went in than
protein. Are we therefore entitled

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000
to include that DNA is the
hereditary material? Why?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Well, I mean suppose that 1% sulfate
is tracking one minor protein that

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
is the secret. You can't,
it's very hard to rule

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
out that there's no contaminants
traveling along with the DNA.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And if you really truly disbelieve
DNA, you could be churlish and say,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
well, I just don't believe that
you've so purified it that you can

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
completely rule out that some
minor protein component is really

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
conferring heredity. In
fact, when you really look

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
closely, Avery, McCarty
and McLeod's biochemistry,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I believe, was purer than
the purity of this experiment.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
But by this point thinking had
begun to shift toward DNA being a

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
reasonable hereditary molecule.
In addition, it was the second line

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
of proof, different from the
pneumococcus, using a different

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
system, both pointing to the same
answer. And the intellectual tide

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
shifted to recognizing that
this probably was right,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
and the reason these experiments
were pointing to DNA was DNA had to

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
be the right answer.
But, of course,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
how was it the right answer?
What was it about DNA that could

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
confer these properties? This
was still unclear in 1953,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
but not for that long. It became
clarified relatively soon thereafter.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And, of course, it
became clarified with the

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
understanding of DNA
structure, the double helix.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Nobody here has not heard of the
double helix. Probably there's

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
nobody, no grownup who doesn't know
about the double helix and all that,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
but nonetheless I want to stop
and think a little bit also,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I'll say on a personal note,
this is the first year I've taught

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
this class after, the
first time I've taught this

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
class when Crick and Watson
have not both been alive.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Some of you may know that Frances
Crick dies just this past summer.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Which was very sad. He was
an incredible person and,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
you know, as I've said,
Mendel was one of my heroes.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Francis Crick was also one
of my heroes. He was just an

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
extraordinary person. But
Jim Watson is still alive and

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
kicking and still quite active.
And so, in any case, you're not far

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
removed. So, I tell you a little
bit about this stuff as history,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
but this history I'm telling
you about, these people are,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
for the most part, Francis'
passing notwithstanding,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
alive and kicking. Jim
Watson is still quite alive.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Actually, McCarty is still
alive. It's really, anyway.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So, 1953, just a year later,
Jim Watson and Francis Crick are

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
working in England. Watson
is a student for Indiana,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
a former ornithologist, had his
interest in ornithology originally,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
and then studies more biology and
came to England because he wanted to

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
study the gene.
Francis Crick,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
a physicist who worked in the
admiralty during World War II.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And, of course, what they did was
on the basis of an awful lot of

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
modeling and getting to see
experimental x-ray diffraction

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
pictures of Roselyn Franklin
from London who made a model.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And the model is this beautiful,
and I haven't drawn it to its proper

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
proportions, but this beautiful
double helical structure.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Five prime, one chain of
DNA running in one direction,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
five prime to three prime. An
anti-parallel chain of DNA going

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
in this direction, five
prime to three prime.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
It was a beautiful structure. Jim
Watson has written a whole book

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
about the discovery of
the double helix structure,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
and we are only 51 years past that.
It was, anybody who hasn't read The

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Double Helix, this book,
really should. It's one of the

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
treat books of science literature,
and actually is on many people's

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
lists of some of the great
books of the 20th century.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
It's a wonderful competitive story
of Crick and Watson racing against

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Linus Pauling.
It's, you know,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
someone came along and had lunch
in Cambridge with Crick and Watson.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And they came away and said, this
was before they discovered the

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
structure, about a year or so before,
and said these guys are idiots.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
They can't even memorize the
structure of A and T and C and G,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and they're trying to find,
you know, the structure of DNA.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
These guys are never
going to get anywhere. So,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
this person, who we'll come back
to in a moment, was wrong about this

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
particular point. Because
what Crick and Watson did

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
was they played around with the
models, and what they ended up

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
noticing was a couple of things.
First off, from Rosalyn Franklin's

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
pictures, that this was helical.
The x-ray to fraction pictures could

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
tell you at a glance that
the structure was helical.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
They saw that. They then
tried to make helices. Now,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
other people, Linus Pauling knew
something that DNA probably had to

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
be helical, and somehow he
just got it totally wrong.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
He made just a nutty model of DNA.
Linus Pauling, the smartest chemist

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
of the century made a crazy model
of DNA where he took the sugar

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
phosphate backbones and put all
the sugar phosphate backbones in the

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
middle, and had three of them.
He had a triple helical model with

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
sugar phosphates in the middle.
And what can you tell me about the

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
charge on these sugar phosphate
backbones? Very negative.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
You're going to stick a whole bunch
of negative charges near each other

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
in the middle? No way.
Anybody could have known.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
This was a bush-league mistake,
so Crick and Watson said phew,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Pauling has got it wrong.
They put together this model.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And the key to the model was
the recognition of base pairing,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:15.000
the recognition of base paring.
That if I take a thiamine here and I

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:36.000
take an adenine here. That
these two groups would be

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:48.000
pointing at each other in such a way
as to make two hydrogen bonds with a

00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:01.000
certain characteristic distance.
And, not just that, but cytosine

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:14.000
and guanine could also be
fit into that same distance.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And they would have
three hydrogen bonds.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
And here NH, H,
doo, doo, doo, doo,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:50.000
doo, doo, doo, three hydrogen bonds.
And they would fit the, what do I

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
got? Oops. Thank
you. Good point.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
That's the problem. Yup.
Well, it's a little messy but

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
anyway. The business end here
is three hydrogen bonds and two

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
hydrogen bonds, and they
both fit into the same

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
distance perfectly. So,
this double helix here could

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
have either As and Ts or Gs and
Cs or Cs and Gs or Ts and As.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And they would all fit
perfectly with each other.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Now, there was an old observation,
not that old, there was an

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
observation floating around at the
time that said when you analyze the

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
amount of As and Ts in DNA, you
always found out that the amount

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
of A tended to be very close to the
amount of T. The amount of C tended

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
to be very close
to the amount of G.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Although, these amounts could
be different. This was due to a

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
biochemist called Chargaff. And
they're called, this was called

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Chargaff's Rule or Chargaff's
Law or Chargaff's Observation.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Chargaff noted that the percentage
of these amounts tended to be equal

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
but didn't know what to make of
it. This perfectly explained that.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
It was very good. Remember
I said somebody came

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
through Cambridge and said
these guys were turkeys,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Crick and Watson were turkeys
because they couldn't even remember

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
the structure and all that?
This was a very distinguished

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
chemist who said this about
Crick and Watson. It was Chargaff.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Chargaff came through and
said these guys are turkeys.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
But it was Chargaff's Rule that
Chargaff had missed the importance

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
of. He was quite bitter about
this through much of his life.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And there's a very wonderful biting
quote that Chargaff says when Crick

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
and Watson become famous
for the DNA double helix.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Let's see if I can get it right.
He says that such pigmies should

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
cast such giant shadows,
referring to Crick and Watson,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
that such pigmies should cast such
giant shadows only shows how late in

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
the day it is. Anyway,
he was not happy.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
So, all right. Now, this
was a big deal thing.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Crick and Watson knew this was very
important. They raced to publish a

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
paper about this. They
sent it off to Nature.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
It's a gem of a paper.
It's a page roughly in text.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
It's very short, very
clear, has this beautiful

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
picture drawn from Francis Crick's
wife, Odile. And it is just a

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
charming paper. They know
that they've cracked the

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
secret of life. Why do
they know they've cracked

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
the secret of life? Because
the most important thing

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
about this model here is
not its structure per se.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
But that it explains how it is that
a DNA molecule can be replicated,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
that somehow all it takes is for
those two strands to come apart,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
who knows how, and that when they
come apart each can serve as a

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
template for the other because since
As always match Ts and Cs always

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
match Gs, each strand has
enough information for the other.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
That's how replication happens.
You have two strands, each of which

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
has sufficient information
to encode the other.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
They somehow come apart. They
each serve as a template for

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
the other. And that's that.
That is the secret of life, how

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
life replicates itself. Not
just that. We've explained

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
replication. What about mutation.
What's mutation? It sometimes gets

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
it wrong. It sometimes screws
up. So, for one little biochemical

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
model we've explained replication
and mutation. That's pretty good.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Now, the thing is, in writing this
paper and getting this off to the

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Journal, this was not an easy
thing to get done quickly.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
You couldn't, you just didn't have
time to explain all these details.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
They wanted to stake their claim
about this, so they wrote up the

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
structure. And instead of going
through a long about how this

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
explains replication and dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
there's one sentence in the paper,
the last sentence of the paper in

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
which they just say it has not
escaped our notice that this model

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
explains replication and everything
else. Basically the last sentence

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
says, oh, and by the way, it
has not escaped our notice that

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
this explains the secret of life.
Although, it didn't say it like that.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
It's the coyest sentence in
the scientific literature.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
It's really just an
amazing sentence there.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And then they come back a couple
minutes later and write a paper

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
explaining what they mean and all
that, but it's just a great sentence.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
So, you will hear molecular
biologists make reference,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
use in their speech the phrase,
it has not escaped our notice that.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And it's always a homage back to
this particular sentence in this

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
paper of Crick and Watson.
OK, now, last thing. Yes?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Jim Watson was 25 and Francis
was 35 when he did this.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Yes. He was a 25-year-old kid
when he did this. That's right.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Pretty amazing stuff. So,
last point I want to touch on,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
and I'm not sure I'll get to,
get all the way there, but this

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
model, this model here of DNA coming
apart and each strand serving as a

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
template for the other strand
is called Semi-Conservative

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Replication. That is
one strand is used as the

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000
template for the other strand,
so there's an old strand and a new

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000
strand that's made. In
theory, you could imagine that

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
DNA replication
occurred not like this.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
But instead somehow, I can't
imagine how, but you could

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
imagine, and people were willing
to imagine it, that the old strands

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
stayed together but somehow became
a template for making a new double

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
helix without actually using them.
This model of the strands actually

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
serving as a template would predict
that each new DNA double helix was,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
in fact, composed of one
old and one new strand.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
If you could prove that then you'd
have real confirmation of this Crick

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Watson model, semi-conservative
replication. And so,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
a young student, two young students,
Matt Meselson, who's still working

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
and is down the road at
Harvard and a wonderful person,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
and Frank Stahl, who's still working
in Oregon, proved that the new DNAs

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
that were made after each
generation were, in fact,

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
composed of one old
strand and one new strand.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
How could you possibly do that?
Sorry? Radioactive labeling. But

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.000
how do you radioactively label
it so that you can see that it's,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
that you've got a double helix
that's half one and half the other?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Old ones labeled with, well, with
one isotope. It actually turns out

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
to be nitrogen. The new
one with a new isotope.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Say N14. You can do heavy
nitrogen and ordinary nitrogen.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And if what you could do is grow up
your DNA, when you first grow it in

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
normal nitrogen,
then you shift to N15,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
heavy nitrogen, you could make
DNA molecules that were half old,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
half new, and therefore half
labeled with normal nitrogen,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
half labeled with heavy nitrogen.
And how would I prove that these

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
DNA molecules were a 50/50 hybrid?
What would be the property that I

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
would be able to test? Well,
radioactivity turns out to be

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
really hard to weight density.
It turns out density, if I could

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
just measure the density of the
DNA, I would show that if the

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
semi-conservative model is
true, the molecules will now have

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
intermediate density between
all heavy and all light nitrogen.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
They had to work out a
centrifugation technique so

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
sensitive, a salt gradient
centrifugation where you could put

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
DNA on it. You had a really fine
salt gradient spun in a centrifuge.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And depending on where the DNA
migrated, you could measure the

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
density of the DNA. And
they were able to show that,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
in fact, newly replicated DNA
strands had this intermediate

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
density that would be expected
from the semi-conservative model.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And so, in fact, by that point
the semi-conservative model,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
I think, is well established.
In some sense you would say the

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
beauty of the double helix was
almost one of these very rare

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
scientific results where when
you look at it you say it can't

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
possibly be wrong.
It explains too much.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
It's too beautiful. But, as
we've discussed before, that's

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
not enough. You need some
proofs that it's real.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And this Meselson-Stahl experiment
provided a real confirmation of that.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Onto
next time.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.880
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.030
We're going to continue our
discussion of galactic space

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.170
travel.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.440
Here the situation is slightly
modified from the previous one.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.550
We still have Alice being
our ground control and Bob

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.390
riding on a spacecraft in order
to explore planetary systems

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.160
and solar systems.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.960
This situation is
different in the sense

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.290
that the spacecraft
has an escape rod.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.710
So it's able to send probes to
planets in order to study them.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.870
And so, in this specific case,
the velocity of this escape rod

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.840
is uB delta xB over delta tB,
as measured in Bob's reference

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.660
frame.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.450
The direction of this
velocity is the same

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.590
as the direction
of Bob's spacecraft

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.040
when looking in
longitudinal direction.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.190
Again, as a reminder, velocity
is distance over time or delta

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.600
x over delta t.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.190
So the question now is,
what does Alice observe?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.780
Because this is an activity
you should try to work out

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.150
yourself, stop the video.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.100
I'll just continue here.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.350
So, if you calculate now the
velocity as seen by Alice,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.140
delta xA over delta tA, that's
given by gamma times delta.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.630
We just use Lorentz
transformation-- gamma times

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.330
delta xB plus v times delta
tB over gamma times delta tB

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.486
plus v over c squared delta xB.

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.240
Now, we can cancel the
gammas and take out

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.740
delta tB out of the brackets.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.420
And then we find uB plus v over
1 plus v over c squared uB.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.360
So this looks like an
addition of velocities

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.350
with a correction factor of
1 plus v over c squared uB.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.270
Good.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.270
So does this make sense?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.145
So, whenever we have a
calculation like this,

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.520
we should check that
it actually works out,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.430
that extreme cases
are preserved,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.690
and that units work out.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.210
So, again, the
units work out here.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.230
On both sides, you
find meters per second,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.020
the unit of velocity.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.830
If you check now what happens
if we set uB equal to 0,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.640
we know that the
escape rod is at rest.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.910
There's no velocity with respect
to Bob's reference frame.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.160
In that case, we
find that uA is equal

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.520
to v, exactly the
velocity difference,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.100
the relative velocity between
those two reference frames.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.780
If that velocity is 0,
we find uA equal to uB.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.390
Again, that's expected.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.940
If Bob and Alice are in
the same reference frame

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.460
and they observe
the same escape rod,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.100
they better measure
the same velocity.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.400
And, lastly, if we now, instead
of having an escape rod,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.700
we send a beam of light
out, which has a speed--

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.660
a beam of light has the speed
of light, uB equal to c,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.100
we find that the velocity
observed by Alice

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.320
is also c, which brings us
to an interesting point here.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.750
Yes, we still add
velocities with a little bit

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.600
of a relativistic
correction, but we will never

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.250
get larger velocities
of the speed of light.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.830
So the speed of light is
an absolute speed limit.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.320
Let's analyze this
a little bit more

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.170
in the context of
our light clocks.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.290
So what now happens if
the velocity is equal to c

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.300
is that gamma goes to infinite?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.100
And, in the context
of the light clock,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.510
you can notice that the upper
mirror can never be reached.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.010
It's moving with
the speed of light,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.950
the same velocity
as the light itself.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.110
So light is never
able to reach this.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.380
The clock will stop.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.710
All right, so there's an
absolute limit of velocity

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.200
at the speed of light.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.960
OK, so now, so far, we
discussed only velocities

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.250
in the direction in which
the two reference frames move

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.780
or the second
reference frame moves

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.300
with respect to the first one.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.960
What now happens if we consider
perpendicular velocities?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.899
So, in this case,
Bob's spacecraft,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.630
this escape rod goes up.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.870
Maybe he's circling the
planet, or he's just

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.860
approaching the planet.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.780
And [INAUDIBLE] when
it [? pops at ?]

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.910
that planet specifically.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.820
So here we want to work
out the example in which

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.030
the perpendicular
velocity is not 0,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.180
but the longitudinal
velocity is 0.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.850
So what does Alice observe?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.680
So we do this as a
concept question.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.830
Which of the four
answers is correct?

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.020
Is the velocity
unchanged because we

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.930
are studying
perpendicular velocity?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.200
Is the velocity
smaller, larger, or you

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.700
don't know because
you actually have

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.440
to figure it out, work it out?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.160
OK, so the velocity,
as observed by Alice,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.590
is actually the absolute
value is smaller

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.020
than the one observed by Bob.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.850
We can do the very
same calculation.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.810
So we have uB y is
delta yB over delta tB.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.180
And then, for Alice, this is
uA y delta yA over delta tB.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.340
So the y-component,
the length measured

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.220
in y-direction
between Bob and Alice,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.600
is invariant, as we saw
in the previous section,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.980
but the time is not.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.530
So we do have to do the Lorentz
transformation of delta tA

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.690
and find that, in the case
where uB x is equal to 0,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.880
that we just have to
divide uB y over gamma.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.620
Situation is a little
bit more involved

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.550
when there's also a
longitudinal velocity,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.900
but you see here how
this would unfold.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.250
So 2 was the
correct answer here.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.110
So, while the length in
longitudinal directions

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.420
are invariant, the
velocities are not.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.080
And that's because
time is suspect.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.910
Time needs to be corrected
in the two reference frames.

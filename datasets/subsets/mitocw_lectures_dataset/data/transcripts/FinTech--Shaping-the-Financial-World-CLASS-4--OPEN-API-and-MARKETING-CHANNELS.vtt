00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.085
GARY GENSLER: Welcome
back to fintech.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.400
We're getting together
for our fourth class,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.530
and we're going
to get going now.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.830
Thank you for tying in online
via this modern technology.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.430
Today we're going to move to
important customer interfaces--

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.340
user interfaces and
user experiences that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.460
have been greatly enhanced
by open application program

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250
interfaces.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.810
Now, application
program interfaces

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.910
is not new to finance, and it
didn't start in M&A finance.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.240
It's a basic concept
of how one computer is

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.340
talking to another computer.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.560
And again, this is not a
computer science class,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.870
but we're going to spend
a little bit of time

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.130
on what application
program interfaces are

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.750
and what this
concept of open API

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.800
is and some of the
companies around it

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.710
and how companies have
organized themselves,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.160
both in terms of finance,
and a little bit even

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.030
outside of finance and some
of the challenges with regard

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.710
to that.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.210
What API has also led
to is a movement of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.620
and a greater concentration
around companies

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.210
called data aggregators.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.720
And we'll get into that as well.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.130
As I've sort of worked through
with the class already,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.230
it's my thought that
certain technologies

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.250
have been moving into the
finance technology stack,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.810
and are really part and parcel
to what finance is in 2020.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.107
And I think open API, with its
movement around the globe--

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.940
and some countries have
moved further in it,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.880
some countries have moved
less, some companies have moved

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360
further, some companies
have moved less--

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.230
that this is a
trend that will be

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.490
fully incorporated into the
technology stack of finance

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.590
country by country, if it
hasn't already been so.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.510
But it's been a major disruptor
in the last five, seven years.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.050
And it will continue to
be a bit of a disruptor

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.150
for the next handful of years.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.610
By the end of this
decade, we'll look back,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.940
we'll say that that's
probably already happened,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.620
and there'll be
enhancements around it.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.800
But we'll be fully inside of it.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.490
Maybe not as dramatic as
artificial intelligence

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.380
and machine learning
to our minds--

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.230
thinking of machines
extracting correlations

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.490
better than we can.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.760
But I think it's
fairly dramatic,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.160
in terms of the
advancement of finance

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.200
and all that we
have in front of us.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.910
So that's why I decided to
take one class and one lecture

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.080
on it.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.400
I also want to thank everybody.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.620
Romain put out a survey.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.630
About a third of you took it.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.100
It was a voluntary survey.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.730
And it's helpful.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.650
And what I took back from
the desires of students were

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.990
could I do a little bit more
talking about the companies

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.640
in the fintech space?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.940
And maybe add, if I might say,
a little less, whether it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.040
on the broader technology
or broader policy side.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.425
I'll do my best.

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:29.800
But I also want
to share with you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.870
why I think there's
a reason to have

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.930
some foundation-- some
foundation of what

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.200
the technologies are,
or even some foundation

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.600
on the public policy
side, as we move

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.130
into the latter
part of this class.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.540
The latter part of this class is
really to talk sector by sector

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.790
what the competitive landscape
is, which companies are up,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.910
which companies are
down, and so forth.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.390
But as we've already
talked about a bit today,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.200
the companies really matter.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.680
And I'll sort of interject
that more as we go forward

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.370
during this semester.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.630
One other question is whether we
could have some guest speakers.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.850
I'm kind of going to have
to apologize in advance.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.120
This is kind of what you get.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.480
But over the next
handful of sessions,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.500
if I come up with somebody
to bring in-- it's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.880
a little hard at this juncture
to bring in guest speakers.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.820
But I certainly
appreciate the request.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.960
And with four weeks
to go, you never know.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.870
But with that, I'm going to
start to share some slides.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.610
I don't know, Romain
if you have anything

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.172
you took from the feedback,
which was very helpful.

00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:45.130
PROFESSOR 2: Thank you.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.165
Thank you very much for
filling out the survey.

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:48.790
That was great.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.490
Just two small
announcements from my side.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.980
One, a reminder for
your team formation.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.390
Friday is the deadline.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.227
Please register your teams
in Canvas in the People's tab

00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:00.310
using the Groups function.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.300
If you don't know
how to do that,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.710
I'll be happy to show you.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.650
So please register your teams
of three to four students

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.360
for the group assignments.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.840
And then second reminder,
as per the syllabus,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.590
have one of your team
members just send me

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.860
an email saying what is the
topic that you wish to study

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.088
for your group assignments.

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:17.380
Please don't forget to do that.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.440
The deadline is also
Friday, April the 10th.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.790
Thank you.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.790
GARY GENSLER: Thank you.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.980
And part of that is
just to really help

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.540
you engage in this subject.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.570
To Romain and myself, it doesn't
matter which sector you pick

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.430
or whether you choose
to sort of write

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.660
your paper from the perspective
of incumbents, to big tech,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.700
or to a venture capitalist.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.860
But it's really to
help you sort of engage

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.550
in the world of fintech,
that which we're studying,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.410
and to pick one sector.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.670
And are you taking it from
the entrepreneurial strategy

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.260
of the disruptor,
or are you taking it

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.830
from a big firm, either
incumbent or a tech firm's

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.950
perspective in this regard?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.370
So as I said, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.240
about application
program interface, how

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.110
this fits into the
history of finance,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.040
deeper dive in open
API and open banking.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.410
You were all asked
to prepare and sort

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.040
of look at the Bank of
International Settlements

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.710
report.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.000
So I'm not going to dive in.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.010
I'm going to hopefully
assume that you've had

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.520
a chance to engage with that.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.790
And then talk a little bit
also about data aggregators

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.420
and a movement amongst many
in large financial firms

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.070
to have a standard
setting group--

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.880
a financial data
exchange on open APIs.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.150
And then try to close out a
little bit on robotic process

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.820
automation.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.430
So a lot to cover.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.270
But I think we'll keep it going.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.860
And I ask again,
use the Participate

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.470
button to raise the blue hands.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.840
Use the chat function.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.330
Romain's going to
keep interrupting me.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.830
And we'll have hopefully
a good session together.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.410
So the readings, again, Bank
of International Settlements,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.050
this consortium of 60 or so
central banks around the globe,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.000
stands up reports
and studies from time

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.360
to time on new challenges
they're seeing.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.330
So just that they pick this
topic to write a report that

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.300
came out this past
November of 2019

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.600
is indicative right
there in and of itself

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.610
that it's a movement
around the globe that they

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.620
thought they needed to study,
and an important aspect.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.170
I picked one article
out of the many articles

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.560
that you can grab off the
internet about fintech

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.610
for the next decade.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.010
And this was one article
that I thought was relevant,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.500
because it really
did also include

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.610
this concept of the interface--
the customer user interface

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.620
and what was going on
with regard to APIs.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.630
And then one
article, again, just

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.950
to give you sort of a primer
on robotic process automation

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.410
that I think is
relevant as well.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:13.370
So again, just if anybody wants
to give a little short brief as

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.270
to what are the major
trends on the marketing side

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.860
that's affecting financial
services right now.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.070
And we can go broader
than API, of course.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.622
But Romain anybody want
to sort of contribute now?

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:28.080
PROFESSOR 2: Let's
see, who will be

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.440
our first volunteer of the day?

00:08:33.705 --> 00:08:34.205
Michael.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.890
AUDIENCE: Not sure if this
is exactly marketing side,

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.120
but I think customer
trust is maybe more--

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.600
must have trust in
connecting your personal data

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.755
to a third party.

00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:54.920
I'm thinking something
like mint.com,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.330
where I add my bank account.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.670
I can connect it
and feel comfortable

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.370
giving that information to a
site that's not necessarily

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.058
my bank or my credit card.

00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:04.100
GARY GENSLER: Absolutely.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.600
Absolutely.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.260
So one of the major changes--

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.290
and this has been
a number of years,

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.110
as companies like
Mint and others,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.570
where you'll give
your data to a company

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.680
that you've personally
never met a human being.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.570
You've downloaded an app
and you're giving your data

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.690
to that company,
to give you advice

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.610
or to give you a better rate.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.120
Have you used Mint, by the way?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.135
And do you mind just saying what
product were you shopping for,

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:35.987
or what service were
you looking for?

00:09:35.987 --> 00:09:38.404
AUDIENCE: I was just trying
to track my spending because I

00:09:38.404 --> 00:09:39.770
was spending way too much.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.520
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so there are also

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.970
sites where it can help you
keep your personal budget,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.880
if you wish--

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.900
like personal
accounting and so forth.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.170
And you give them permission
to look into your bank account.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.460
But this trend of using--

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.700
and there many
competitors of Mint

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.470
that we'll dive into in
the next couple weeks.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.930
But there are many competitors.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.340
It's basically
saying, all right,

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.250
I am going to
permission a website--

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.500
a data service provider,
fintech company--

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.450
I'm going to permission them
to look inside my bank account.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.490
I have to give them my password
and my username in some way

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.290
and have them linked in.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.120
Big change.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.810
It takes away a little of the
comparative advantage possibly

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.230
of the big incumbents, because
you and I can give somebody

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.980
else permission to go in
and look at that data.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.438
PROFESSOR 2: [? Iqbal? ?]

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:38.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.890
Morning, professor.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.090
I just want to
highlight that there's

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.790
an avenue to market or to
showcase financial services.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.410
It's starting to be on
a lifestyle platform.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.470
So if you look at, for example,
Alipay, it's all about access

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.290
to [INAUDIBLE] online shopping.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.960
And WeChat's about
access to its gaming.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.490
But there's a lot of these
conflicting financial services

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.060
and key services
that people want.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.690
So it's nothing new.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.940
In fact, Walmart and even
now [? Star Market ?]

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.660
has banks opened up
within its grocery stores.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.570
So I think there'll
be a trend that

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.230
will be for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.170
GARY GENSLER: And so what
[? Iqbal ?] has raised is not

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.270
new-- decades old--

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.660
that even big retailers,
bricks and mortar retailers,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.700
thought, well, should we
have a counter for you

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.660
to do some finance?

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.770
Should we embed finance
into the retailing business

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.280
with the trends with
in-store and branded credit

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.000
cards for decades?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.430
But now online
embedded finance inside

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.600
of Alipay, which was mentioned
just then, and other companies,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.900
to embed the financial
aspects right in their product

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.920
offerings.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.960
And some of that
embedded finance

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.430
is an Amazon credit card or
an Alipay payment mechanism.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.340
Some of the embedded
finance can even

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.240
be that if you're buying
a mattress from Casper--

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.490
I think I may have
referenced this already--

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.940
but if you're buying a
mattress from cash online,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.390
that they might offer what's
called point-of-sale financing.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.330
Now, you and I don't
think of it that way.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.120
They just say, you can pay
over four installments.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.700
But in fact, they're lending
you money for those four

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.880
installments, and it's
embedded right in the product.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.680
And Uber and Lyft actually
embed some finance right

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.490
in their app.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.925
Now, they've built it on top
of credit card companies.

00:12:40.925 --> 00:12:42.300
But they could
choose to build it

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.810
on top of their own sort
of financing mechanism

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.100
with their drivers and the like.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.620
So big change, embedded finance.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.540
Multi decades in
coming, but now it's

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.060
embedded finance in
a technological way

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.390
that it looks
seamless to the user--

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.320
or can look seamless.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.713
PROFESSOR 2: Nikhil.

00:13:05.713 --> 00:13:07.380
AUDIENCE: The other
piece that I thought

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.880
was interesting was the article
talk about first the uncoupling

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.970
of financial services.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.720
So a lot of fintech incumbents
decouple the product offerings.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.560
But then there's a resurgence
of bundling products again.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.450
So when you look at
Wealthfront, they

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.070
started with just
asset management.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.910
But now they're offering
cash management.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.990
Robinhood's the same way.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.032
It came out trading,
but again, they're

00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:29.490
trying to pivot to
cash management.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.610
So they focus on very niche
products to begin with,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.977
but there seems to be
bundling happening again.

00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:35.810
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.320
And I think this is
unbundling and rebundling

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.050
happens in many industries.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.750
Some of the proponents in
the most optimistic side

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.600
of financial
technology say, we can

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.100
have a flattening of finance.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.590
We can have a full
unbundling, where

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.410
you can get each of your
products separately.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.010
And while the
technology can and does

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.210
facilitate that, I
think our tendencies

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.530
in markets and as humans,
and our behavioral science

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.900
tells us that bundling happens.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.900
So even if this transitional
period of time--

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.810
even if this late 20-teens
and early 2020's allows

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.400
for a lot of unbundling, I
believe that a lot of this

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.840
will stay bundled and rebundled
within particular websites,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.990
particular product offerings.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.210
I don't know of Leonora
is trying to speak,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.330
because your name's popping
up here on the screen.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.410
But if not-- how would
open API initiatives

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.150
influence all of this?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.340
I've sort of said it
a little bit myself,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.650
but anybody want to chime in?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.100
PROFESSOR 2: Geetha?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think I
speak from the incumbent side.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.180
I think open APIs have made
it so easy from a banking

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:17.670
perspective, in terms of ability
to track what is being accessed

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.390
of customer data.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.460
Because before APIs
and before some

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.730
of the standouts
like OAuth and OIDC,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.770
they were pretty much
dependent on screen scraping.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.420
And it was very difficult
for us to track.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.640
And the customers pretty much
gave their user ID and password

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.230
to these vendors.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.200
And they could pretty much log
in and screen scrape anything,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.400
and we won't even know.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.340
GARY GENSLER: So you're saying
Gita, from the incumbent side--

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.580
from the big financial firm
side, these new startups--

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.760
the Mints of the
world, so to speak--

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.170
were able to get folks'
usernames and passwords,

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.440
and come into the
incumbent systems,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.510
and grab the data
through a method

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.170
called screen scraping, or
even through a robotic process

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.870
automation, which we're
going to chat about.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.200
And you're saying you feel from
an incumbent side it's better

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.080
to manage all of that--

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.550
those interfaces, which
could be disruptive.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.970
You'd have more awareness
and more security

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.071
around that interface.

00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:29.502
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:16:29.502 --> 00:16:31.460
GARY GENSLER: And then
how does it influence it

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.630
from the consumer side?

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.660
Anybody want to throw an
idea from the customer side?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.120
I agree with what Gita's saying.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.120
PROFESSOR 2: So I'm not
sure it will be related,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.120
but Yi had his hand up.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.430
GARY GENSLER: Sure.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think the benefits

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.290
is more for the fintech company
rather than the incumbent.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.330
Because it basically
lowered the entry barriers.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.330
So I guess from the
consumer perspective,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.820
now you have many more options.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.470
Previously, you can only work
with those like large banks.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.800
But now you can work with many
more companies that are there.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.530
So the market is more
competitive, basically.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.430
GARY GENSLER: So if I
permission a company like Mint,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.579
Mint can give me advice around
my cash flow management.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.380
If I have permission
a company like so

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.920
SoFi, which is, frankly,
competing with the banks--

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.200
competing with lending products.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.200
But if my SoFi to
see my accounts,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.020
then I get more
options as a consumer.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.940
SoFi might compete
with the banks,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.200
but also give me a better user
interface-- user experience

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.180
as well.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:46.460
So it's far broadened out
the world for the consumers.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.980
And then I put a
couple of readings

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.780
in about robotic process
automation and screen scraping.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.410
Gita's already
raised this a bit.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.410
And it's being used.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.890
It's also being used by
the financial sector.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.440
So anybody want to add how you
think about robotic process

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.600
automation in a positive way?

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.990
In a way from the incumbents
and the financial firms,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.060
how they're using it.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.090
It's certainly also being
used by the disruptors trying

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.330
to get information
out of the incumbents.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.300
They're using it as sort of
an automated screen scraping

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.880
to grab information
from the incumbents.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.380
But does anybody
want to sort of say

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.230
how maybe the
incumbents are using it

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.600
in their business models?

00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:36.860
PROFESSOR 2: Hassan.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.860
AUDIENCE: Hi, professor.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.780
Yeah, I just have a
question about the APIs.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.460
I don't actually totally
understand what are these.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.830
I mean, is it like
an operating system?

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.960
I mean, what's an API exactly?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.570
I've tried to google it, but
I've not quite understood.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.790
GARY GENSLER: So I'm
going to dive into it.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.590
Can I hold that, Hassan,
just for a minute?

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.830
Because I'm going to dive into
it in the next six minutes.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.800
But fundamentally, an
application program interface

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.010
is a method that two
computers can speak to.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.330
And the traditional
way, and the old way,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:22.820
it was just how one system
can go in and get information,

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.280
get objects out of
the other system.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.470
And then we'll do a
little cursory dive

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.910
into what it looks like today.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.950
Because it's moved a lot
from that traditional method.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:41.560
On a web-based API system, you
can actually sort of almost--

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.860
it feels like on your computer,
on your laptop, so to speak,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.760
that you're actually operating
that system at a distance.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.270
So you sort of think of it like
it's not only just grabbing

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.690
some data or objects or
records, but it's actually

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.770
sort of grabbing
some application,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.600
as if it feels
like you're really

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.090
operating it on your system.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.080
Open API is this
conceptual framework

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.020
that it's a public
interface, rather than

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.630
a private interface.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.890
And if you think that
you could literally

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.430
have just a restricted private
interface that you give one

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.820
other computer, whether
it's an affiliate of yours

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.170
or a customer of yours,
a contractual private

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:32.430
interface to do that which
they wish to do, or is it

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.350
a public interface, where
broadly it can be interfaced?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.080
And so that's sort
of a thumbnail.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.930
But let me sort of develop
that a little bit more

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.910
over the next half hour.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.300
Does that help?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.873
Thank you very much.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.790
PROFESSOR 2: So to answer
your question, Gary,

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.962
we have Ivy and then Andrea.

00:20:52.962 --> 00:20:53.670
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.870
And then I'll move on.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.540
Thanks, Ivy.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just wanted
to answer the question.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.850
Because I thought the
Medium article did

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.910
a good job of talking
about the different ways

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.920
that are banking use cases.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.770
And I've actually
gone through a lot

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.690
in terms of just
on the banking side

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.270
like actually having to do
customer onboarding and KYC.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.880
And like we actually have
what's called a KYC analyst.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.270
So all this is actually
very, very manual typically.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.000
And going through
compliance checks,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.543
we'll be working on a deal,
and at the last minute,

00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:32.210
you can't get compliance
checks through.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.440
And it's usually a huge pain.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.900
So I was excited to see
that they could potentially

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.930
change the system,
because it ends up

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.510
being a huge headache
for everyone.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.210
I think my question, though, is
like, when I read about this,

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.500
obviously it seems like--

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.120
I'm sure the
technology is there.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.220
But I think about just like
any bulge bracket banks--

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.370
their IT infrastructure
has been in place

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.750
for like 50-plus years.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.700
And changing that
technology is like removing

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.370
one piece of a really
big complicated puzzle.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:11.700
So I almost just question
how feasible that is.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.370
Like the article does
a really good job

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.250
of laying out what we
can actually automate.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.130
But I guess I am a
little bit skeptical as

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.340
to like when that
time will come.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.250
GARY GENSLER: And Ivy,
may I ask which bank

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.270
or what country you were
working in that was doing this?

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.450
AUDIENCE: I worked at
Merrill and Barclays.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.030
GARY GENSLER: So Merrill-Lynch
or Barclays, you're right,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:35.960
they're incumbents.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.000
And they can
automate many things.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.840
The technology is in advance
of what they are actually

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.600
doing right now.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.010
But robotic process automation
can provide both incumbents

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.810
and disruptors.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.600
But the Merrills and
Barclays are already

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.510
using it to some
extent to automate

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.120
that which humans are doing.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.240
Some of it, as we'll
dive into later on,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.190
is about reading documents.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:09.410
Just literally an object
reading a document.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.440
You could say that one form
of robotic process automation

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.160
that we already have is when
we can deposit a check by using

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.550
our mobile phone.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.350
Now, that also uses natural
language processing,

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:26.130
and it sort of reads that into
the computer, and so forth.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.920
But you're absolutely right
that each in incumbent

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.210
is dedicated to ensuring that
if they're moving from a legacy

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:41.670
system to a new system, that
they do that in their own way,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.390
so that it doesn't
break in the middle,

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.370
and that they actually
do save money.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.990
And they have to schedule it.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.810
And they might not get to
that project for 18 months

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.700
or even five or seven years.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.060
And sometimes that's what
gives the fintech disruptor

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.560
the opportunity--

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.150
that the incumbent can
use a new technology.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.830
In this case, RPA.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.780
They can use that technology.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.680
But they can't schedule it for
three years or even longer.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.240
Or if they're
scheduling it, they

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.490
have to do it in a
very controlled way.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.370
And the disruptor
then is coming along

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.010
and having an opportunity
in the meantime

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.450
to attack that business model.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.310
So I thank you.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.730
Romain are there others,
or should I move on?

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.950
PROFESSOR 2: We finally
had Andrea, who I believe

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.210
has experience on this topic.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.150
So we could all benefit from it.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but I wanted
to add a similar point that we

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.430
just discussed with Ivy.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.890
So we can move on definitely.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.310
But what I appreciate about
the RPA in the incumbents

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.290
is that it helps
them to increase

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.540
the efficiency in operations.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:53.330
But at the same time, it also
brings in the standardization.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:59.090
And people can focus--
or employees of the bank

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.130
can focus on more
value-adding services.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.350
For example, the advisory
to the client when

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.390
it comes to more
difficult products,

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.770
such as mortgages
or consumer loans.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.910
But at the same time,
as you mentioned,

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.120
the time and the resources
that you need, especially

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.070
in huge incumbents like
Merrill or Barclays,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.177
it takes a lot of
time to get there.

00:25:24.177 --> 00:25:25.010
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.690
And so what's interesting about
each of these technologies--

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.900
and this is true if
we broaden it out--

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.010
open API, robotic
process automation,

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.550
they're both a tool
for the disruptors

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.980
to produce services
and new business models

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.950
to the consuming public,
And, they're also

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.440
tools to the
incumbents, depending

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.450
upon on how they can
invest in those tools, how

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.390
they can update their
business models, and the like.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.360
And in particular in open
API, we'll see there's a real

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.020
challenge, that the
large incumbents--

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:04.060
the JPMorgan Chases and the
PNC Banks and so forth--

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.190
are sharing data now with
a lot of the disruptors.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.300
They're providing greater
services to their ultimate end

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.040
users and customers.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.350
But then also they're
concerned about,

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.220
are they giving up some of their
inherent competitive advantage

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.440
of controlling that data?

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.060
And so there's some
real trade offs,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.670
particularly in
the open API world,

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.900
as to how banks look at this.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.430
So I wanted to go back to the
question of like, what is API?

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.390
I just was able to find
a slide of TechTarget

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.320
that I thought was helpful,
just to think about this.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.050
An API, just think
of two systems

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.220
that are linking together.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.540
And sort of the original APIs
was just a local application

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.810
program interface that sort
of could connect two computers

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.810
together.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.560
Web-based API, which went
further-- and web-based APIs

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.070
have been around for 30 years.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.560
This is not a new technology.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.960
But web-based are
designed really

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.370
to represent such that
they could be widely used.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.920
HTML now and later
something called

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.000
REST API, which is more
recently, these are protocols.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.900
These are protocols that
multiple parties on the web

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.570
can come into your
service in some way.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.910
And then we talk
about public APIs,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.740
which really sort of
broadens it out further.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.630
And you could even
think of this as sort

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:37.600
of private registered APIs
to broadly publicly available

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.400
APIs.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.830
And what many businesses
are trying to use--

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.880
and they manage it.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.430
And it's a very active
part of strategy,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.180
is to manage that interface
to allow the developer

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.110
community to interface
with your platform.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.370
Facebook needs to do it.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.200
Instagram needs to do it.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.570
Any network-based or
platform-based service actually

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.140
wants to encourage developers
to build applications

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.535
on top of the platform.

00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:08.910
So now you bring
this to finance.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.700
Does JPMorgan Chase, does Bank
of America, does Barclays, does

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.610
Merrill want to do the same--

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.490
encourage development
of applications

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.600
on top of their platform?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.630
Recognizing that they make
a lot on their platform--

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.280
their balance sheet, their
funding models, their data,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.550
their analytics.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.570
Do they want to encourage the
development of applications

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.830
on top?

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.220
And it's a little bit of a push
and pull, because they're also

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.470
encouraging development
of applications

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.520
that might compete
with them, but also

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.870
enhance what they're doing.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.860
So I sort of found this
other spaghetti slide

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.920
that I thought was
really helpful.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.330
Now, if you think
about thousands

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.960
of financial firms dealing
with thousands of public,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.000
this spaghetti wire
gets even worse.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.210
But application
program interface

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.390
is a classic problem of math.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.990
It's that if you only have two
computers by two computers,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.690
you might need four
lines of connections.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.550
But all of a sudden
when you have thousands,

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.550
you could have this
spaghetti wire of interfaces.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:25.580
So what's happened in the midst
of this in sector by sector

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.020
is that there have
been companies

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.670
that really have an API
management layer in between.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.180
And in many sectors,
you've seen a consolidation

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.140
around either one standard
for APIs or companies

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.870
that are really service
providers in the middle.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.260
And here are some
examples in non-finance.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.390
And whether you know
underneath the hood

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.820
about Twilio or others--

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.370
Twilio probably has,
I'm told, something

00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:00.770
close to an 80% market share
in voice and messaging.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.380
That they're sort of that
layer in between the disruptors

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:11.690
and the service providers
and the classic companies,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.380
providing a layer in the middle.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.360
A layer in the middle.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.670
Checkr does it on employment
checks when we want a check.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.410
Each one of these companies
were startups over the last 20

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:25.910
years.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.670
Salesforce is a
little bit earlier.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.170
And they really took--

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.810
even if they didn't
know it at the time,

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:40.390
they took the concept of open
API and API and they built it.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.510
And in fact, there's these
words they call API first--

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.490
that you can build
a strategy saying,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.550
we're going to be the
best providing APIs.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.350
Now, who's done this in finance?

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.475
Who's done this in finance?

00:30:54.475 --> 00:30:57.370
One company that you might
think of as a payment service

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.400
provider, Stripe,
did it very well.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.920
Stripe basically said, we
will be that API provider

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.450
in the payment space.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.300
What company did it really well
most recently that we talked

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.360
about last class was Plaid.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.120
And we're going to come
back into Plaid as well.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.200
But Plaid did this very well.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.600
Now, they didn't
start by saying,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.760
we're going to be
only an API company.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.970
But they did start with
being an API company.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.280
It was two entrepreneurs,
in Plaid's case,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.100
about six or seven
years ago that said,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.940
there really isn't a good
API in the payment space.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.890
Now, there was Stripe.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.530
And I'm not sure about
their foundational stories,

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.370
why they didn't feel that the
Stripe APIs were good enough.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.070
But they created an API.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.400
And of course, Plaid just
recently sold for $5 billion

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.980
plus to Visa, or
announced the sale.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.500
So we talked a little
bit about finance

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.240
and this history, the stack.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.870
And I'm going back to the
customer interface stack.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.360
We don't need to go back
to bricks and mortars

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.280
and electronic payments.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.010
But again, sort of the
conceptual framework

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.140
of this class and
how I think about it,

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.570
the most recent things
added to the stack--

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.620
the internet, mobile phones,
contact cards, and the like--

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.870
those are all fully engaged and
part of the finance technology

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.020
stack.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.180
And now we're adding
open API and chat

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.460
bots, which we talked
about last class,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.060
and natural language
processing, robotic processing.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.210
We're adding that to the
finance technology stack.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.610
And that's sort of the
conceptual framework.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.900
And I think those are where
the opportunities are.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.830
In five or eight or
10 years from now,

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.570
it will be taken for granted.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.670
Of course, there'll
be enhancements.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.560
And every change,
there's an enhancement

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.950
that creates some
opportunities as well.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.300
So what do we mean by open API?

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.990
To [? Iqbal's ?]
earlier question.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.080
Open Application
Program Interface

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.590
provides developers
access to and an ability

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.450
to get permissioned
customer data.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.610
That means you and I
give a password, you

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:16.350
and I give a username.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.560
Open banking
initiatives-- open banking

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.195
is unique to the
financial world--

00:33:21.195 --> 00:33:24.930
are initiatives usually
promoted by the official sector.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.930
Usually promoted either
by the central banks

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.300
or by the banking
regulators, and sometimes

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.610
promoted by
competition authority,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.940
to say you must
share certain data

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.640
or you must create some
standards for these open APIs.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.200
And again, as I just
mentioned, open APIs

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.000
are in every field
of online services,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.030
from voice to
employment to retailing.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.960
But the competition authorities
and the central banks

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.180
around the globe
said, well, maybe we

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.820
should lean into this--

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.940
the official sector-- lean
in and promote competition

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.370
for this sharing of data.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.280
And these initiatives,
which you've

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.520
got a chance to read about,
do have policy trade offs.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.600
And why I focus on
these policy trade offs

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.280
is they're also
about competition.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.400
Incumbents are not
going to really want

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.000
to embrace
competition like this.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.679
Having said that,
many of the incumbents

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.123
recognize that it might
be that they're shifting

00:34:33.123 --> 00:34:35.290
right now-- that their
business models are shifting,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.900
and they have to think
like platform companies.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.840
And to the extent that the
JPMorgans or the Barclays

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.699
think more like
platform companies,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.219
they want to encourage
the developer community

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.969
to develop applications
on top of their platforms.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.980
If they think it's simply
losing market share to the SoFis

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.310
and to the new
banks, then they're

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.620
going to be more
closed to open API.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.600
If they think more like
platform companies,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.160
they're going to
want to promote it.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.740
But there are also trade offs.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.050
There are also trade offs
that the big incumbents

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.600
would say about cybersecurity.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.720
If we just let anybody
into our platform,

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.490
they can also bring down
that platform possibly.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.910
And so these are real
public policy trade offs,

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.345
but they're also commercial
trade offs as well.

00:35:26.345 --> 00:35:28.220
[Romain I don't know if
there was a question.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.200
I see some activity in the chat.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.080
PROFESSOR 2: We have a
question from Geetha.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.955
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.720
PROFESSOR 2: Gary, I've been
thinking a lot about incumbents

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.280
becoming platforms.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.560
Other than an ability to allow
access to their customer data

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.610
to lenders, I'm
not able to think

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:58.680
of examples of what kind of
platforms incumbents can be.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.930
Like, they are not a
specific payment company.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.180
They're only servicing
their own customers.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.130
So I wonder if you
have any examples.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.350
GARY GENSLER: So I think
many of the major banks

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.050
are already platforms.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.200
They don't necessarily think
of themselves this way,

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.360
but they are bringing together--

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.300
and this is true for centuries--
they are bringing together

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.970
borrowers and
lenders, or savers.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.420
So they have a balance
sheet that brings together,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.010
in some cases, millions of
savers and tens of thousands

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.170
or hundreds of
thousands of borrowers.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.010
And they're bringing
that together.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.850
And when you consider that sort
of the modern large financial

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.730
firm with $1 trillion or
$2 trillion balance sheet,

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.810
many of the largest [? were ?]
[? all-- ?] and so forth.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.820
And so they're
bringing that together,

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.650
and they're managing risk.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:59.300
And they're very good
at it, or some of them

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.550
are very good at
that risk management

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:05.600
of those millions of
depositors and tens

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.970
or hundreds of
thousands of borrowers.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.610
That in itself is a platform.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.830
That creates a data
advantage that they

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.870
have about risk management.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.610
And it could be a real one.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:21.620
And they can offer activities
and products on top of that.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.350
The fintech startups
can be, in a sense,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.160
a front end distribution
channel to bring more in.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.500
Because a lot of
the fintech startups

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.190
don't have that same
balance sheet capability--

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:38.660
that same ability to in
essence earn a spread

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.510
between savers and borrowers.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.670
Now, you might contend,
well no, they're

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.500
losing their
competitive advantage,

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.490
because those startups
sort of have that customer

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.780
interface, that direct--

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.140
one might consider it the
last mile with that customer.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.780
But the technology companies
have taken another approach

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.200
in saying, we like developers
developing applications

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.520
on top of our platforms.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.320
We think it brings
more activities.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.240
We think it brings more
interface, more data.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.920
And so they're sort of a
network that is bringing data

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.505
and activity on the platform.

00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:18.380
But I agree with you.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.180
It's a real strategic trade off.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.230
It's a real strategic challenge.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:26.487
And the incumbents are
still sorting it out.

00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:27.320
PROFESSOR 2: Camilo?

00:38:30.238 --> 00:38:31.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:37.060
I just wanted to ask, in
one of the other lectures,

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.440
they tried to classify
the open banking between

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.130
[? prescriptive, ?]
to facilitate

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.800
market-driven, and in-process.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.000
But there were many countries,
as for example Colombia, who

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.150
didn't have any classification.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.320
What's the meaning of that?

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.530
It means that it's forbidden.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.660
I mean, is it impossible
to scrape the data

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.457
from that from the bank?

00:39:02.457 --> 00:39:04.040
GARY GENSLER: So
it's a good question.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.190
The Bank of International
Settlements paper I think

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.090
is to which you refer.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.270
And what they did was country
by country review where it is.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.530
And in fact, that's
probably good

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:21.980
leading to the map that was
in that report that I'll show.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:26.530
In many countries, the
central bank, bank regulators,

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.050
and competition authorities
have not said much.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.070
I'm not close enough
to Colombia to know.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.490
But in those countries, you
can still technologically

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.750
go in and scrape.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.940
An alternative,
as I lay out here,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.880
is actually scraping
from the screen.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.900
And so I think actually
it's the next--

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.910
I grab this slide from the Bank
of International Settlements

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.450
reports.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.390
And thank you, it's a
great setup, Camilo.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.240
That Europe passed
something called

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.330
the Payments System Directive.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.010
And it was actually
the second time

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:04.210
that the European parliament
came together and said,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.060
we need to promote in
the payment space--

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.170
not necessarily in
the lending space,

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.080
but in the payment space--

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.380
that there's more
availability from merchants

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.600
and from fintech startups
to access your data and move

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.200
money.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.960
That's Europe.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.550
And as the Bank of
International Settlements says,

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.370
it's more prescriptive.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:32.360
In the countries that are gray
on this map-- most of Africa,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.930
many parts of the
Mideast, and so forth,

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.700
parts of Latin America--

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.340
the Bank of International
Settlements, I should say,

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.150
only covers about 60 countries.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.820
So many of the
parts that are gray

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.220
are countries that Bank of
International Settlements

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.950
didn't survey.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.980
But those countries
are probably,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.950
like the US, technically
market-driven.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.560
There is no federal
law in the US,

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.570
and there's no
banking rule, that

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:04.070
prescribes that you must
have open API in the US.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.130
So I think that in Colombia
it might be a technically

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.850
market-driven, where
the startups are using

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.660
some form of screen scraping
and some form of robotic process

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.950
automation.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.220
But what we found in the US
is companies like Stripe,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.650
companies like Plaid,
others that I'm

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:27.780
going to list in a moment,
like Yodlee and others,

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.050
just built a business model
out of creating public APIs.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.270
And the incumbents
possibly in Colombia

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.530
are dealing with the same.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:38.190
I don't know.

00:41:40.335 --> 00:41:40.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.610
Well, I don't know.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:46.840
In Colombia, the banks are
happy to not let create APIs,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.360
because they don't believe
themselves as platforms.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.960
They prefer to charge
any type of fees

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.120
for whatever they can do it
in the small print letter.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.830
So they get more the
defensive approach,

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.980
rather than what you're saying,
seeing themselves as a platform

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.790
and monetizing over many
layers of application.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.560
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, I think
that in many countries

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.350
and in many incumbents,
they're taking

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.450
a sort of guarded approach,
and sort of saying,

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:21.262
no, no, no, this is dangerous
for our business model.

00:42:21.262 --> 00:42:22.970
This is dangerous for
our business model.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:28.730
But to that incumbent that
does that, often they lose out.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.650
It sometimes takes
years to lose out.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.540
But it's that
somebody finds a way

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.330
to encroach on that
business model.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.710
And what we're finding
around the globe

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.870
is that more and more
countries are promoting this.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.670
Brazil, for instance,
is taking it

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.170
to their national legislature.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:49.325
Now, with the corona crisis, I
haven't stayed closely enough.

00:42:49.325 --> 00:42:51.360
It looked like it was
going to pass this spring.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.470
And maybe one of the students
knows whether they did.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.830
But the central bank was
trying to, in essence,

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.150
insert more competition, so
that E2O and others in Brazil

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.000
had to sort of take a
little bit more competition

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.010
in that environment.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.690
So my prediction would
be, even in Colombia, it

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.780
would be hard to guard against
this for multiple years.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.500
Maybe a few more years.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.980
But they'll be guarding a
business model that will

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.500
have some encroachment on it.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.000
The Bank of
International Settlement

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.070
also sort of did
this chart, which

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.380
sort of said what's mandatory.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.110
Australia and Europe is
fuller to the mandatory.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.060
That's why they're at
the top of this chart.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.570
And you see the US,
China, Argentina, probably

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.320
Colombia, is technically market
driven towards the bottom.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.000
It's also what products?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.550
Is it all about
just funds transfer?

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.890
Europe was more about payments.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.830
Was it also about the
underlying product information?

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.770
Because if it's
forced upon the banks

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.260
from the official sector--

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.770
in the US it's not.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.850
But in Europe, in Australia,
Hong Kong, it has been.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.240
If it's sort of by
the official sector,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.580
then it might well
be that you have

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.130
to include the product
information, as well as

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.130
the information underneath it.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.850
So back to the
market-driven side.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:18.020
So the market-driven side is
what's happened here in the US.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.960
And what's happened here
in the US-- and I list--

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.750
this is not just the US,
but also Europe, Australia,

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:24.820
and some places.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.970
I list about a dozen firms that
are very active in this place.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.000
This is not forced by
the official sector.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.070
This is basically the
private sector saying,

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.140
let's avoid that spaghetti wire.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.870
These are companies
that are going

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:45.880
in between all the startups and
the financial firms and saying,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:52.710
we can provide a standard
way to do these interfaces.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.720
Plaid that I talked
about just announced

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.550
it's being sold to
Visa for $5.3 billion.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.860
What do these firms compete on?

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.370
They compete on a lot of things.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.860
First is coverage.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.420
If I'm Plaid, do I cover
all the banks that you need?

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.620
If I'm a new startup,
and I'm thinking,

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.360
should I use Plaid or Yodlee?

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.780
And Yodlee and Plaid
are deep competitors.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.810
Maybe one can stay just as
competitive with each other

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:25.720
as Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.310
Yodlee was acquired years ago
by a company called Envestnet.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.880
But Yodlee and Plaid, deep
competitors to each other.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.610
Well first, what
coverage do they have?

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.560
As a startup, if I use
Plaid instead of Yodlee,

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.820
can I get to all of the banks?

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.460
What services do they
give me as a developer?

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.840
Obviously, what price?

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.740
Are they reliable?

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.270
What's their security,
and the like?

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.800
So all of these are important.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.360
And one of the sort of
incumbents in this space,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.030
Fiserv bought CashEdge.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.270
And Plaid was being
bought by Visa.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.550
So some of these get caught up.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.680
SaltEdge is in 55 countries.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.650
And then I did a little
research on a paper that

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.390
was written three years ago--

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.050
or it's really a website
that keeps a list.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.380
And I sort of put together--
this list is three years old.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.620
These are the
account aggregators

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.910
in all of these countries.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.027
And I'm sorry, Camilo, I
don't see one for Colombia.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.730
But all of these
companies in some way

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.070
built up a business
model to say,

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:40.750
we will serve in these
various countries

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:45.370
to be between the
incumbents and the startups.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.490
We will build some
business model in between.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.410
Now, what can you
do once you do that?

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.370
You get a lot of data.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.670
And so what used to be
just a software company--

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.920
Plaid, for instance,
started as, in essence, we

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.190
can provide this software.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.830
Started to have remarkable
amounts of data.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:16.480
And that remarkable
amounts of data in Plaid--

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.290
founded in 2013, sells
for $5.3 billion to Visa,

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.520
or announces the sale,
only 450 employees.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.170
And Forbes estimates it's only
had $109 million of revenues.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.710
So that's nearly
50 times revenues.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.810
Quite a multiple.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.720
You might wonder why
Visa's doing this.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.170
This is from the Visa slides
that Visa announced in January.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:44.880
This is how they
sort of picture.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.840
They look at Plaid.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:53.540
They say, Plaid is connected
to 2,600 fintech firms.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.310
That's 2,600 fintech
firms connected to Plaid.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.950
And then Plaid on the
other side provides an API

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.580
into 11,000 data sources--

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.980
11,000 financial firms.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.790
2,600 fintech firms
connected to Plaid, Plaid

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.390
connects to 11,000.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.400
Again, that's the classic
place you want to be.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.880
Plaid is at the bottleneck.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.250
Plaid is at the
gateway, you would say.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.550
And they can collect data
on 200 million users.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.440
Visa thinks there's
a value in that.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.370
We'll have to see.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.320
We'll have to see
whether that ends up

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.200
being a good acquisition
for Visa or not.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.350
But these companies
in the middle--

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:43.450
the Plaids, the Yodlees,
have right in the middle

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.280
created value.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.050
Romain I'm going to
pause there and see

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.610
if there's some discussion
that we can get going.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.280
PROFESSOR 2: [? Iqbal. ?]

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, professor.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.528
Can you shed some insight as to
the relationship between Plaid

00:49:04.528 --> 00:49:05.820
and the financial institutions?

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.612
What's in it for the
financial institutions

00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:10.850
to face Plaid in reality?

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.030
Were there fees involved?

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.590
Because in the example
we looked at some

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.490
for some Latin American
countries, such as Brazil,

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:23.430
the incumbents are reluctant
to participate in open API.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.670
And it would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.760
GARY GENSLER: It's
a terrific question.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.520
And I'm going to
apologize, because I'm

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.726
going to slide back
here on the slides a bit

00:49:35.726 --> 00:49:40.140
to go back to something.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.960
This is what they want to avoid.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:47.160
Even the incumbents don't
want thousands of folks

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.130
to enter into
contractual arrangements,

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.580
enter into secure private APIs.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.250
Even the incumbents
want to sort of avoid

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.610
this spaghetti wire of mess.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:06.150
Now, it might have been less
strategic and more incremental

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:13.110
that when you think about all
these companies on this list--

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.890
these 10 or 12 that have built
up these remarkable businesses,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.310
or around the globe all these--

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.130
that many of these started
as small software providers.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.470
And they were saying
to the big incumbents,

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.960
we can handle that
spaghetti wire.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.050
We can ensure that
people aren't just screen

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:34.220
scraping and using RPA.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.450
It's going to happen anyway.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.180
You need somebody
to help manage.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.540
And so every modern
online company

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.390
in finance and
outside of finance

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:49.620
has to have an AP
management strategy.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:55.020
You don't normally think about
something in the CEO suite,

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.930
this chief executive
officer who's managing this.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.660
But here we are at MIT, I'd
like to bring this technology.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.360
This is an important
technology question

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.000
that you need to be
asking is, how are we

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.510
managing our
developer community,

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.700
our public interface?

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.250
Are we going to
do it internally,

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.450
or are we going to hire a Plaid?

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.340
And I can tell you that
the banks now-- this

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.790
has happened in the last
four to seven years.

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.710
And many of the banks
are sort of saying,

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:26.970
this has gotten out of hand.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.680
This has gotten out of control.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.450
Is this something
that we really want

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:34.140
to allow the Plaids and
the Yodlees and others

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.020
to commercialize our data?

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:42.510
But I think that in part, it
was incrementally decisions

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:46.610
about how to manage
broadly this interface.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:50.960
And it's also possible
that it wasn't far enough

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.110
up in the C-suite, and
it was sort of managed

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.810
down in some regards.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.370
But one reaction is this
financial data exchange

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:02.390
that's happened here.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:07.190
And I've listed the
major founders of FDX.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.890
But Financial Data Exchange--
and this is straight from

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.140
their own white paper--

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.830
they want to create this group
of remarkably large banks.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:23.330
I think the members of FDX have
$2 trillion of market value,

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.260
if I remember.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:30.470
Because many of these actually
have $2 trillion balance

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:31.610
sheets.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.523
When you add up all
of these companies,

00:52:33.523 --> 00:52:34.940
they've come
together and said, we

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.540
want to create standards
for financial data sharing

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.090
and secure APIs.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:45.950
We want to basically not sort of
have the Plaids and the others

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.780
commercialize our data.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:52.790
Even though that's
not in FDX' mandate.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.810
But in some regards, the
cat's already out of the barn.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.710
And now they're
grappling with it.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:08.670
But the JPMorgans and the
PNC actually, I believe--

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:13.560
which is a large
mid-sized bank in the US--

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:19.510
has stopped having Plaid have
access, if I'm not mistaken.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:23.810
So it's sort of an interesting
challenge back and forth.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.525
PROFESSOR 2: You now
have Geetha and then Lin.

00:53:26.525 --> 00:53:29.150
GARY GENSLER: Geetha's from the
incumbent side going to tell us

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:32.170
why they're using the Plaids.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just wanted
to make a comment on Plaid

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.310
specifically.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.940
We allow access to a number of
fintech lenders to our data,

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.680
because then we have no choice.

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.980
Because the customer is
providing access to their data,

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.030
and we have to allow
them to access it.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:53.050
To somebody's question
earlier, the biggest problem

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:53.680
with Plaid--

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.420
and I'll probably
send some articles

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.830
on kind of issues between
Plaid and Capital One.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:03.160
There was a period of time
when we stopped giving access

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.070
to Plaid, because
Plaid wouldn't comply

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.920
with any of the standards
that we imposed.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.710
For example, we
needed fintech lenders

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.880
to come from certain IPs,
because they looked like bots,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.380
right?

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.350
Because they do all
these batch accesses,

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.120
and they look like bots.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.930
But Plaid wouldn't comply
with those standards,

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:27.280
and it became very difficult
for us to differentiate Plaid

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.220
from a bot.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.790
And even though we had APIs,
they would do screen scraping.

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:36.070
Sometimes they would come
through our mobile channels.

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.195
Sometimes they would come
through our web channels.

00:54:38.195 --> 00:54:40.540
They would come through any API.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.090
It became really hard for
us to differentiate Plaid

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.300
from fraudsters.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.700
So there was a period of
time when we blocked Plaid.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.420
And then they came to the
table, we had conversations,

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.420
and then we let them in.

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.610
GARY GENSLER: And Geetha,
you were at Cap One?

00:54:57.610 --> 00:54:58.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:58.980
Yeah.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.188
GARY GENSLER: So for those
who might not be familiar,

00:55:01.188 --> 00:55:05.220
Cap One is one of the largest
credit card banks in the US,

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:11.460
competing head to head with Bank
of America and Citi and Chase,

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.180
Discover, and American
Express and so forth.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.090
I sort of call it the Big Seven.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:24.120
And Cap One's the largest
that isn't in and of itself

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.145
one of the big four
banks in the US.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.110
So it's a remarkable
organization,

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:35.760
and it's cut out a big
chunk of its business model

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.575
around serving customers
in the credit card space.

00:55:39.575 --> 00:55:40.950
And here you're
hearing Gita say,

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:46.680
but we didn't really have a
choice, is what you're saying.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.670
Romane, others?

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.670
PROFESSOR 2: Let's go
with Lin, and then Carlos,

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.670
if we have time.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:57.645
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:55:57.645 --> 00:55:58.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:02.360
So in the example for Plaid,
it seems like most of the data,

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.820
if not all of the data,
is financial data coming

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.440
from financial institutions.

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.690
I'm just curious to
hear your thoughts

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:12.270
on the market moving towards
using non-financial data.

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:15.200
So customer data in
the retail health

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.920
sector to inform or build
financial services upon,

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.135
and whether there are
any people doing that.

00:56:22.135 --> 00:56:22.635
PROFESSOR 2:

00:56:22.635 --> 00:56:26.450
GARY GENSLER: No, it's a
really good observation

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:30.530
that the data aggregators--

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:32.550
I'll go back a slide.

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:36.000
This whole cacophony
from three years

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.980
ago around the
globe, or the data

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.960
aggregators here in the US--

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.620
these big eight or 10
in the US and Europe--

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.930
these data aggregators
are largely

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:50.750
about financial data for now.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.010
So their business
strategy-- these dozen

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.810
companies, their
business strategies

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:59.080
was sort of API first.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.370
They built an API upon which
they got a network advantage

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.400
to get a lot of financial data.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.950
But it is also true that
they could add other data.

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:13.120
And in fact, Plaid
gets bought by Visa.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.640
Yodlee got bought by Envestnet.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:21.730
And Envestnet is also in asset
management and fund management

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.210
and so forth.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.550
I believe you're right.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:25.960
Your observation is right.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:31.010
A lot of these "API first,
data aggregator second"

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:35.300
are also going to be adding
other non-financial data.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.880
Alternative data, as
we've talked about,

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.700
can come from finance,
like whether you're paying

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.740
your utility bill or not.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.370
It can come from finance
and building full cash flow

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:47.990
underwriting models.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.860
But it also can be your
social media footprint.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.120
And it often is.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.490
Alternative data is
about your social media

00:57:55.490 --> 00:58:00.200
input and your
footprint, I should say.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.430
Your footprint.

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.070
So I think you're right.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:09.750
Their comparative advantage
is around this financial data.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:16.910
Plaid, that's their advantage.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:21.320
I want to note one company
that's on this list here,

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.590
I think I included, was Galileo.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:24.090
Did I?

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:25.880
Yeah, I included Galileo.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.730
Galileo has done a
recent fundraising round

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:31.670
in the middle of 2019.

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:32.960
It's still private.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.007
I think their valuation
was $1.2 billion.

00:58:36.007 --> 00:58:37.340
Might have been a little higher.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.260
I can't recall the figure.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.460
So it's a unicorn.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.650
Not many of us have
heard of Galileo.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.340
But two of their big customers--

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.990
Chime is one.

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:51.170
I'll just say, Chime is
one fintech company that's

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.790
one of their big customers.

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:55.610
Last year, Galileo had a glitch.

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:58.370
And Chime went
down for 24 hours,

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:03.150
because Galileo's standards
in API had a glitch.

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.170
So sometimes, you're
that fintech startup

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:10.560
relying upon a Galileo,
in that instance.

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:16.070
And if Galileo software has a
problem, you have a problem.

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:21.170
So there's that challenge
too in the midst of this.

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:23.630
Marqeta has done a
fundraising round.

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:26.240
I think its valuation
is about $2 billion.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:32.450
Again, still private, still in
the venture land, and so forth.

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:37.620
So there's significant
value that has been built,

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.230
API first, data
aggregation second.

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.600
And these companies
are all somewhere

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.810
between the incumbents and
the developer community

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.170
and the startups.

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.150
Back to the class, Romain?

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.160
PROFESSOR 2: Carlos is up.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.780
So I just want to give
an example of a shout

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.340
out to Plaid,
really, for something

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.507
they're doing at the moment.

00:59:58.507 --> 01:00:01.990
So as part of the SBA PPP
program for emergency funding

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.850
for small businesses with
the whole corona crisis,

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.263
there's $200 billion being
disbursed over the course

01:00:07.263 --> 01:00:07.930
of three months.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.463
And actually probably
this Thursday

01:00:09.463 --> 01:00:11.380
there's going to be an
additional $200 billion

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.830
approved.

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:13.750
$250, sorry.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.640
So what Plaid is doing
is they're actually

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.640
helping, because of their
role as a data aggregator,

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.630
to populate the payroll portion
of these loan applications,

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:25.020
because a lot of banks are
trying to do it manually,

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.220
which is completely
infeasible, given

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.660
the massive size of the
rollout that they're proposing.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.230
So thanks to Plaid and
what they're trying to do,

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:34.630
at least, a lot of
loans can be approved,

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:37.937
or at least applications
submitted exponentially faster.

01:00:37.937 --> 01:00:40.020
And that can make a huge
difference for businesses

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.860
to survive.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.440
GARY GENSLER: And I thank you
for bringing that information

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:44.940
in.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.510
Do you work with Plaid?

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:47.770
Or have you worked there?

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.265
Or is this something you're
reading about online?

01:00:50.265 --> 01:00:51.640
AUDIENCE: So I've
been following,

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.920
because I work for a
fintech-focused VC that

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.700
actually invested in Quovo,
which was acquired by Plaid.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.840
So I know the model pretty well.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.410
GARY GENSLER: These companies
have brought a great deal

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:04.690
more financial inclusion.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.510
These companies have opened
up the banking sector,

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:08.410
to some extent.

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.330
And now the banking
sector was probably

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.270
going to be opened up
by competitive pressures

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.430
in any regard.

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:20.900
But with the Plaids,
earlier Stripe, the Galileos

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.350
and the Yodlees and
others, what they've done

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.690
is they've brought
some standardization

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.840
to that spaghetti wire
that I put earlier--

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.470
these interfaces.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.180
They're in the weeds.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.423
To some of us, it might
just be mundane connections.

01:01:39.423 --> 01:01:40.090
But they're not.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:43.640
They're really, really
important connections.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.480
And I would say if you take
anything out of this lecture

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.210
and moving forward, if
you're at an incumbent

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:52.870
or you're at a startup,
that you sort of think

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:54.920
about your API strategy.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.290
What is it?

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:59.600
You might not manage it, but
it's good to know what it is.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.800
You might know what your
competitors view of it.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.350
But I agree with Carlos that
in this time of crisis--

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:12.670
the corona crisis in the US, the
program that he's referencing,

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:19.180
was of this $2 trillion package
that Congress just passed,

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.570
there was $350 billion
to fund small businesses.

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.590
They have to be 500
employees or less.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:28.750
But small businesses.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:34.233
It's called a Payroll
Protection Program, PPP.

01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:36.150
And through the Small
Business Administration,

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:40.570
it guarantees the
banking sector can

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.580
make loans that are forgiven.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:47.430
So they're forgivable loans
up to $10 million a piece.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.680
They're a loan,
but they're really

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.580
a grant if you can show
in your application

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.030
that the money is going
to support employment.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:03.060
And there's various
conditions and conditionality.

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.830
And so what Carlos
is talking about

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.370
is in the loan applications,
the loan applications

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.680
were first being filed
I think last Friday,

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.780
but it might have
been over the weekend.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.020
And these loan applications had
to go through your employment

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.260
and show who you had earning
less than a certain amount

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.980
of dollars per employee.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.367
So a lot of data.

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:22.950
A lot of data.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.200
And it sounds like
Plaid is actually

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.250
helping facilitate
that, in some regard.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.860
So thank you.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.550
Romain.

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:37.820
I think I'm getting close to
that 15 minute warning time.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.860
But is there another
question, or are we

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.780
just going to move
on to robotic process

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.860
automation for a minute?

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.360
PROFESSOR 2: I think
we can move on.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.820
And indeed, we have
17 minutes left.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.960
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.910
So let me just
pause for a minute

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.700
again on financial
data exchange.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.280
I'm not close
enough to it to know

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.020
where they are in
their development.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.590
But basically, a large set
of big incumbents-- and I've

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:05.860
just put a visual of
their principal members.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.370
But then they have behind
this another 50 or 100 second

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:10.600
tier members.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.830
And by second tier,
this is the group

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.800
that's primarily running its
board of directors and sort

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.150
of coordinating.

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.230
And it has all the big US
banks on here, the largest--

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.160
Quicken Loans,
which is the largest

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.030
in mortgage lending
in the US, and CIFBA,

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.633
which is the trade association.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.050
They're coming
together to say, we

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.110
need to standardize financial
data sharing standards

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:41.200
for secure authentication and
how this user experience works.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.520
But part of it--

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.530
well, part of it is
the incumbents sort

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:49.403
of trying to reclaim a
little bit of the territory.

01:04:49.403 --> 01:04:51.820
I don't think the cat's going
to be able to be pushed back

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.210
into the barn, so to speak.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.320
Or you might say the
horse is out of the barn,

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.170
and I won't use the cat.

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:03.310
But I think that this is an
interesting dynamic that's

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.440
going on right now.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.010
Now, you put that in the
context of what we talked about,

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:10.930
robotic process automation.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:16.200
Robotic process automation
can be used in a positive way

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.830
by the incumbents and
by the startups to do

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:24.480
account opening, onboarding,
as we talked about earlier,

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.040
loan processing.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.310
Anything that you
can take and automate

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:32.810
that which humans are doing.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.690
And I'm not sort of
moving into chat bots

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:38.690
and the conversational
interfaces

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:40.340
that we've already spoken about.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.690
I'm talking about the more
standardized documents,

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:49.550
reading the documents,
and opening the accounts,

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.850
and, as was mentioned
earlier and I maybe

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:54.380
should have put
on this list, also

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:59.070
compliance for any
money laundering

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.590
and Know Your Customer.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.660
Those are very positive ways.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.960
But it's also a way
that challenger banks

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.020
and challengers can use
it to scrape the data

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.960
and pull the data out
of the incumbents,

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.350
as long as a customer
permissions it.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:23.290
So it's sort of both of those
sides in a very positive way

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:26.440
across the entire
field of finance--

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.410
a very positive way that
we can automate that which

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.740
humans are doing in the past.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:36.910
This is frankly just the same
as when the tractor came along

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.670
and we were automating
what humans and the horse

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:42.580
and the cow and the oxen
were doing in the field.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.550
We can automate that
which the human does.

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:48.180
But it changes the way that--

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.020
the sort of dynamic between
incumbents and startups.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.660
And then I want to pause and
see if there are questions.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:02.905
And then I wanted to say bit
on assignments, and then close.

01:07:02.905 --> 01:07:05.030
PROFESSOR 2: We have a
question in the chat for you

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:08.510
from Alex, a Sloan
fellow, who tells us

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:11.210
that one of the readings
one of the authors

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:14.130
ends with consumer will access
financial services from one

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.590
central hub.

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.900
But then another author
in another reading

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.230
speaks of another trend
of embedded fintech.

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:22.820
So which ones of
these perspectives

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.940
would you tend to agree with?

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.880
GARY GENSLER: Well Alex,
I think that's the debate.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:35.960
And I think you probably could
guess that I'm at neither end.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:46.200
I don't think that we'll end
up with truly decentralized

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.720
and we can sort of disaggregate.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.520
We had this discussion
a little earlier.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.950
Will it be completely unbundled?

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:53.920
I don't think so.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:00.690
I think there's still going to
be economic benefits to scale.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:03.440
Sometimes that's driven
by balance sheet.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.690
The balance sheet financing
side leads to scale,

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:12.530
though securitization and
asset securitization as a way

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:14.620
to rent somebody
else's balance sheet

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.870
and to sort of lay off
that risk to somebody else.

01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:21.260
But I think that there's a
lot of reasons that scale

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.120
and network effects--

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.910
balance sheet being one of
the network effects, data

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.029
being another network
effect, customer user

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:31.399
interface another
network effect--

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:36.290
that there's benefits
to some scale,

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.810
that there will be
some concentration.

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.520
Will there be one portal?

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.700
Will we go all the
way to one portal?

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.120
Will it be that
Amazon will sort of

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.000
be the one place I go to for all
of my online financial needs?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.220
Jeff Bezos might have
a strategy that way.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.439
You might write papers that way.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.450
I would caution that
I think that there

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:02.270
will be some
competitive pressures

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.310
and economic pressures
on the other side--

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:07.220
that we'll still have
some disaggregation.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.460
For instance, in
country after country,

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.189
for decades, there's
been the debate

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:16.670
whether insurance products will
be sold by banks and banking

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.920
products by insurance firms.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.760
And for some reason
around the globe

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.840
by and large, we still
see this separation.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.930
Some of it's just
legacy and history.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.180
Some of it is regulation.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.220
But it's also how we
think of the products,

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.630
that we think of buying
our life insurance

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:38.323
or our household insurance
or auto insurance

01:09:38.323 --> 01:09:39.740
a little differently
than we think

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.779
about funding the same things.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:46.609
Funding our house is called a
mortgage and funding our car

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:49.880
is what's called an auto loan.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.359
Now, it's true in some
countries, it's come together.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.580
But by and large,
it's not one portal.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.170
But Alex, do you
have a point of view?

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:03.810
Did you did you feel strongly
one way or the other,

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:05.740
if you're there still?

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:13.590
AUDIENCE: I think the embedded
fintech is quite insightful,

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:16.590
because nowadays
that people talk

01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:20.490
about customer-centric
ideas even more than before,

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:24.390
because we have more data to
provide relevant services.

01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:29.580
But the thing is that when we
talk about the jobs to be done,

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.580
financial services are
not actually the job.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:38.340
The ultimate job you want to
get done, you want to buy house,

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.620
so you need a loan.

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.060
Which means that maybe it makes
sense, some of the services

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.360
will be the second layer.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.840
I mean, be embedded into
those jobs that really need

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.952
to be done by the customers.

01:10:51.952 --> 01:10:53.910
GARY GENSLER: I want to
say this about embedded

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:57.840
finance and this concept
that was in the article.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.990
And I'm glad you reminded
me of this, Alex.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.690
I do think that we're
going to see more

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.030
what's called embedded finance.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:08.710
And by that term,
what I take from it--

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:10.390
and it's not a
well-defined term.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.550
You can't look at a
Webster's dictionary

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.620
and say what's embedded finance.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:20.560
But what I take from that term
is that non-financial firms

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.350
will embed some
aspect of finance

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:25.420
in their product offering.

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.890
Not a new concept.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:30.040
Even the local grocery
store in the 19th century

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.890
was saying you can buy your
groceries and pay tomorrow.

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.670
You know, that local merchant.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:40.300
And that led over 50 or 70
years to the modern credit

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:46.390
card being invented in the 1940s
and taking off by the 1960s.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.230
So we've had some concepts
of embedded finance.

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:52.530
But I think that the
modern technology

01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:57.720
will provide more alternatives
to embed a payment mechanism

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.380
or a lending mechanism.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.800
And those will be the
two principal things.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.230
Some aspect of a loan or
some aspect of payment right

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:07.890
in an app.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:11.460
In a sense, like
Uber and Lyft does.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:16.850
In a sense, like of
point-of-sale lending--

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:21.140
that I can buy
something online and pay

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.700
on installment over
four or six payments,

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.870
maybe over multiple months.

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:32.170
I think embedded
finance is a trend.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:37.940
I also do think that because
of this API movement--

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.660
and this is a way
to close on APIs--

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.170
that startups can
provide services in a way

01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.270
they couldn't in the past.

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:48.460
That a Robinhood
could come along--

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.380
and we'll talk about
Robinhood more when

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.820
we talk about capital markets.

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.400
But a Robinhood could
come along and say,

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.210
we offer that you can
open brokerage accounts

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.690
on this handheld device.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:05.110
You can scan your documents
using robotic process

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:07.180
automation and natural
language processing.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:11.250
You can scan your documents
by taking a picture

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:15.420
from your phone, open
a brokerage account,

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:19.920
and trade automatically,
interfacing-- there's probably

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.730
dozens of APIs that stand
between your Robinhood

01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:26.970
app and the New
York Stock Exchange.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.890
And it's not just
Robinhood directly

01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:30.210
to the New York Stock Exchange.

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:34.780
There's multiple
interfaces in between.

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:39.210
So I think it's facilitated a
remarkable shift in finance,

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:43.230
that we can do those things
right on our cell phones.

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:48.810
And embedded finance and
these APIs relate to it.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:50.850
I'm just not quite
there that it will all

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:54.090
be bundled up into
one service provider,

01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.678
or that it will
all be fragmented.

01:13:56.678 --> 01:13:58.470
I think we'll have a
little bit in between.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080
I just want to mention
something on assignments,

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.060
because the April 8th.

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.870
Again, assignments--
particularly at this stage,

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:13.800
where we're pass emergency,
no credit emergency,

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.770
or sort of colloquially
pass/fail--

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:19.560
assignments are a great way
to engage in this subject.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.490
I think of that even when we
have A's and B's and things

01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:24.780
like that.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.570
I just really ask you to
engage in this subject.

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:31.260
Pick some subject that
interests you, that excites you,

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:33.690
and you want to write
to an incumbent,

01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:38.490
to a big tech firm like
Amazon or Andreessen Horowitz.

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:42.270
Which Andreessen Horowitz owns a
slice of a lot of the companies

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.850
we've been talking
about already.

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:48.060
I mean, they're a remarkable
venture capital firm.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.900
And just think of some
sort of strategy around it.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.880
The individual
papers are just a way

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.340
to break up the
assignment in a way

01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.410
that one person
would write about it.

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:01.050
Overall market
analysis, somebody

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.850
doing the technological trends.

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:10.120
If you pick that you're writing
to Amazon about, let's say,

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.580
the consumer lending space, what
are the technological trends

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:18.180
really doing to that space?

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.920
Who are the
traditional competitors

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.990
and who are the big
tech competitors?

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:26.850
And just breaking it up three or
four pages, 900 to 1,200 words.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:30.473
Again, we're just helping you
kind of engage in a subject.

01:15:30.473 --> 01:15:32.640
PROFESSOR 2: Perhaps you
can answer another question

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.015
that I've received from a
student who does not understand

01:15:35.015 --> 01:15:36.135
how Plaid makes money.

01:15:36.135 --> 01:15:37.260
What is the business model?

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.950
GARY GENSLER: With only $110
million in revenues-- now,

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.050
that's a Forbes estimate--

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:46.300
you sort of go, wait a minute?

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.680
How does this work?

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.020
But how the space makes money--

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:56.030
not just Plaid, but
how API companies make

01:15:56.030 --> 01:16:02.150
money in finance and outside of
finance is they do charge fees.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:05.750
I apologize, I don't know if
it's a penny a transaction

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:06.560
or what it is.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.770
And maybe somebody on
this call actually knows--

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:12.560
Gita or others know their
actual revenue model.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.560
But charging a very small
fraction of money per trade.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.650
And then what they do
is data aggregation.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:24.260
And with that data
in other fields,

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.960
then you try to see how
you can commercialize

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:34.430
that data by cross-selling
either directly.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:36.350
Or remember, a lot
of these companies

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:40.640
like Plaid and Galileo
and others are in between.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.170
They're behind the scenes,
between one side of the market

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.040
and another side of the market.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.780
But when you create
that like Twilio,

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:56.630
Twilio is an 80% market share
between voice and messaging

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:59.300
and things like that--
in the US, at least.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.190
So all of a sudden,
then you can either

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:03.500
enhance your fee
structure, because you're

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:07.090
such dominant
oligopolies, sort of.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.190
You can collect economic rent.

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:11.020
Or you commercialize the data.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.720
And it's the data
aggregation side--

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.340
I think Visa's paying what
might be 25 or 50 times revenues

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.190
for that data aggregation side.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:29.220
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for coming today.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.070
I'd like to formally start
the course, The Fundamentals

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.010
of Photovoltaics.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.317
That's 2.626/2.627.

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:37.150
Why don't we dive quickly
into the syllabus,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.762
and then, a few slides of
motivation, why we're here, why

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:40.970
we're studying photovoltaics.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.380
Hopefully, get you
excited for the course.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.440
The syllabus that
you have before you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.700
should outline the course
objectives and the course

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.464
learning objectives.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:51.630
At the end, during the
background assessment survey,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.460
we'll take the last
10 minutes of class

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.810
for you to provide your
feedback to us, the teaching

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.600
staff, to make sure that
we're addressing your needs

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.160
and your interests.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.730
So take a quick moment to read
over that while I describe

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.200
the overall flow of the course.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020
The course roadmap, this
little diagram right here,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.290
is essentially a
three step component.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.820
We first instill
the fundamentals

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.540
of how light is absorbed
into a material, how charge

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.612
is excited, how then
charge is separated

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.070
and a voltage
created, and finally,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.720
how a charge is collected.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.700
And that is the essence
of a photovoltaic device.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.690
In 30 years time,
photovoltaic devices

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.930
probably will still be
using that combination

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.360
of physical processes.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.230
So understanding
these fundamentals

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.670
will arm you-- will give
you the information needed

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.250
to be able to assess any
photovoltaic technology that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490
might be presented to you.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.300
Then, in the second
component of the course,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.890
we'll discuss the technologies,
the specific technologies that

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.390
are out there in
the market today,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.140
and those that are up and
coming that have the potential

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.470
to replace them.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.330
And as a third
part of the course,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.130
we'll be discussing
cross cutting themes.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.130
These include the policy,
economics, and social aspects

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.080
of photovoltaics that, of
course, are of general interest

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.740
and are particularly interesting
for scientists and engineers,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.990
who spend most of
their time thinking

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.156
about the fundamentals, to
take a step back and look

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.720
at the broader picture.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.170
A note on the fundamentals.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.520
I recognize that many of you
come from diverse backgrounds,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.390
some from nontechnical
backgrounds,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.880
many from mechanical
engineering who never really

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.650
have looked into semiconductors
or semiconductor devices.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:38.040
Not to worry, as you'll
see on page number-- page

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.350
number 2, meeting times, class
recitation, and office hours.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.270
We provide a number of
opportunities for you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.910
to get more closely engaged
with us, the teaching staff,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.780
and to work through
some of the fundamentals

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.000
as you might
experience difficulties

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.394
in the learning process.

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:54.310
Let's take a quick look
at the course schedule

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.070
just to situate ourselves.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.380
So the course schedule
follows that three step

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.020
process very closely.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.650
The first component of the
course, the first third,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.670
roughly, is focused
on the fundamentals.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.690
So we'll learn about light
absorption, charge excitation,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.280
charge separation,
and charge collection.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.880
And the recitation
times will be used

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.440
to discuss those fundamentals
because, for many of you,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.424
this is the first time you're
working with this material.

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.590
The second third of the
course, on PV technologies--

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.552
when we discuss the industry
that's out there today,

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:27.760
how it's evolving, how the
different technologies are

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.690
evolving, this is when
we get to experience

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.330
some of the industry pain
upfront, up close and personal.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.886
We'll be making solar cells.

00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:38.260
And as part of your take home
quiz number two-- as you'll

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.634
notice, take home
quiz number two

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:41.820
is distributed right
in the beginning

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.810
of October-- middle of October.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.860
And then it's due in
the middle of November.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.152
So it's almost a month.

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:49.400
And the reason it's
a month long take

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.130
home quiz is because,
during the recitation times,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.620
we will be making
solar cells with you.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.750
And it will be a little
bit of a challenge.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.090
It's not only to make the
most efficient solar cell,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.050
but the most cost
effective solar cell.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.830
And so we'll be making
technology choices

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.180
as we go along, processing
our solar cells,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.690
deciding whether we do
process A or process

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.960
B. We'll be doing the
calculations that we learned

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.668
how to do during the
fundamentals section

00:04:12.668 --> 00:04:14.760
to predict what the
efficiency gains should be.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.179
And it will have
costs associated

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:18.220
with each of the different
process steps as well.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.636
So it will be a little bit of
a game, a little competition

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:22.310
within the group,
as well, to see

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.930
who can make the most cost
effective solar cell in terms

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.520
of dollars per
unit power output.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.470
And finally, in the last
third of the course,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.460
this is really when the
projects kick off in earnest.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.710
We have several really
interesting projects lined up

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.730
as well as we're open to
hearing your own project ideas.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.840
This is when you form teams
of three, four, perhaps five,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.190
but hopefully three or four.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.740
And you will be addressing some
of the most important questions

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.020
of the day, obviously, in a
very bound, well-defined way.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.130
And some of the projects
that we have lined up

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.950
include looking at actual
photovoltaic installer

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.180
data coming from houses
with temporal resolution

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.600
on the order of five minutes.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.450
So you can obtain
a huge database

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.220
of maybe 10,000, 15,000 homes
distributed geographically,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.670
and determine to what
degree is the ensemble

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.730
of photovoltaic
systems predictable.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.516
Obviously, if a cloud
goes over one home,

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:22.140
power output drops
pretty dramatically.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.020
But if you begin averaging over
several homes, how predictable

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.131
is the solar power
output of that ensemble?

00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.380
And that's going to be very
important as photovoltaics

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.430
scales up and assumes a greater
percentage of the total grid.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.270
Another interesting
project we have lined up

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.810
is with the World Bank.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.930
This is with folks
in Washington DC who

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.230
are looking into a project
called Lighting Africa.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.000
And they're installing
PV on small little lights

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.620
and distributing those to
folks in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.460
And their big question
to the MIT audience

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.110
is, with some of the newer
up and coming technologies

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.180
out there, how will this
impact their technology?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.030
How will this impact
their lighting?

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.420
And so the
deliverable at the end

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.270
will be a technology
perspectus-- one page.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.970
A lot of thought
has to go into it.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.970
That will be
delivered to companies

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.369
that will be selling their
products in Africa to guide

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.660
them and to inform them about
some of the up and coming

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.190
technologies and how their
markets will be impacted.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.359
Like those two projects,
we have several others.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:15.900
And we're open to
your ideas as well.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.177
So if you're really jazzed
about one particular topic,

00:06:19.177 --> 00:06:21.510
there will be opportunities
to let us know, specifically

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.300
on homework number
2, when there will

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.270
be a specific question
there, are you

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.350
interested in a particular
topic of your own.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.392
We'll assemble-- begin
creating teams early on so

00:06:29.392 --> 00:06:31.975
that there's some bonding going
on, especially during the cell

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.450
fabrication part during the
second third of the course

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.190
when we make the
actual solar cells.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.060
But then, the third
part of the course

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.380
will be really focusing on
the class projects themselves.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.710
So that's the lay of the land.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.360
And I want to give you some
motivation as to why we're here

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.620
and why this is
really a special time

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.210
in the field of photovoltaics.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.750
This is not your parents'
solar energy anymore.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.350
Things have changed quite a bit.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.680
And hopefully, over the
course of these slides,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.970
I'll be able to convey that
message loud and clear.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.860
We'll go ahead and get started.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.210
So first question is why
photovoltaics, or why solar.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.320
Photovoltaics is one particular
embodiment of solar energy

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.320
where we convert sunlight
into electricity.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.294
And in most
photovoltaic panels--

00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:19.710
I'll definitely let you guys
come up and have a look at it

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.170
afterwards.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.128
In most photovoltaic
panels, you have two leads

00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:24.310
coming out, basically,
the equivalent

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.774
of a positive and a negative.

00:07:26.774 --> 00:07:28.190
And you have a
bunch of cells here

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.204
that are converting the
sunlight into electricity.

00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:33.370
It's different than, let's
say, solar thermal, which

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.020
is converting
sunlight into heat,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.180
or solar to fuels, which
is converting sunlight

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.540
into chemical energy.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.880
And the reason we're
studying photovoltaics

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.180
as a starting point is
because PV, photovoltaics-- PV

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.870
for short-- is the most
widespread technology,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.120
widespread solar conversion
technology out there today.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.970
So the big question is
why solar in general.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.580
Why are we at all
interested in this?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.170
Can anybody tell me what
this is a picture of?

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.971
It's obviously not
from the United States.

00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.970
Does anybody recognize
the language here written

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.005
on the side of the boat?

00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:09.640
It's very small.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.905
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:11.780
AUDIENCE: Portuguese.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.360
PROFESSOR: It's Portuguese.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.294
It's from Brazil.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.710
It's form the
northeast of Brazil.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.500
It's a small island
called Morro de Sao Paulo.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.040
It's located about an hour
south of Salvador in Bahia.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.590
These are folks arriving at
the island with gas cylinders.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.970
There is no underwater
cable linking the island

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.980
with the mainland.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.070
So they're arriving by
boat with gas cylinders.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.330
They're tossing them
into the salt water.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.419
They're pushing
them onto the beach,

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.990
rolling them on the
beach, until they

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.490
get to the little sandy
roads-- of course,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.390
getting grains of sand
embedded inside of the nozzle

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.550
and so forth.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.400
This illustrates to
me the great risks

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.910
that we go through to supply
ourselves with energy.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.830
It's just one, what might
be considered by our safety

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.990
standards here, extreme
example of associated risk

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.170
with supplying of energy
and effort, of course.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.020
But if you look at our energy
supply to the United States,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.260
it's no less heroic.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.862
It just has
different dimensions.

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:11.320
And so the energy
that we use today

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.444
is often produced in some
faraway land, not always,

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:16.220
but often, transported,
sometimes over thousands

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.960
of miles, and brought home at
significant risk and peril.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.470
And the question is, why
do we go to such extremes.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.887
And second question is,
is there a better way.

00:09:24.887 --> 00:09:26.470
So to answer the
first question, here,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.920
why we go to such extremes, if
you look at the world at night,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.470
and then look at our human
development map, which

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.790
I use Facebook-- what better
indicator of human development

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.450
is there than Facebook?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.190
This map right here shows
you the number of linkages

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.230
between people on Facebook.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.590
And of course, the density
of the bright lights

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.480
there is representing
the number of users.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.140
And you can see that the
two maps, the electricity

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.510
consumption and the
technology adoption

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.950
map very closely,
one on to another.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.236
And it's almost down
to the specific region

00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:00.360
once in a specific country.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.730
This is especially noticeable
in some of the developing world

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.100
where you see these pockets of
high concentration of people,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.980
essentially capital cities.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.090
You have Lagos, Nairobi,
and so forth-- Jakarta.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.640
And you have this
huge concentration

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.270
of people that, of course,
are using electricity.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.882
And more and more people
flock to those cities,

00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:23.340
especially in
developing countries,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.830
because the standard of
living tends to be higher.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.030
There is a certain indicator,
called Human Development Index,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.402
that was put together
by the World Bank, which

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:33.860
pulls together a
number of factors,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.260
including expectation of
life, infant mortality, and so

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.240
forth-- education levels.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.990
So in some hand
wavy way, comes up

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.580
with a metric that indicates
quality of life, roughly.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.300
And on the x-axis here, we have
annual per capita electricity

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.960
use-- not energy, but
electricity specifically.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.062
And we see some form of
correlation between the two.

00:10:56.062 --> 00:10:57.770
So one could naturally
conclude from this

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.540
that energy is
fueling development,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.110
and energy is also fueling per
capita income, as a result.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.660
This little bubble chart
hear, courtesy of UC Berkeley,

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.570
is showing you the size
of the bubble here,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.470
indicating the size of the
population, and of course,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.060
the position on this
graph indicating

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.010
the per capita energy use
and per capita income.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:26.520
The reality is that many of the
up incoming energy consumers

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.260
aren't quite there yet in
terms of their energy use.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.160
There will be a drastically
increasing demand

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.710
as several regions
of the world turn on

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.940
as they begin plugging in and
demanding more electricity.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.880
So somehow we have to
satisfy that growing demand.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.950
So to put things in
perspective as well,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.560
here we have the world
somewhat at night.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.730
World population in millions.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.380
And so we have somewhere around
10 billion approaching by 2050.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.380
And you can see that the
majority of the growth,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.620
what's driving world
population, is Asia and Africa.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.400
Those are the two lines.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.830
My apologies for the small text.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.550
But that's the yellow
line right here.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.770
And the black line right here.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.020
They're the two largest
bars in that Pareto chart.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.180
And the projected
human energy use

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.880
is only going to
go up as a result.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.809
So again, we look at
the world at night.

00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:21.600
Now instead of looking
at the bright areas,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.900
we're going to focus on
the dark areas instead.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.275
The regions of the world where
we do have high population

00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:29.100
densities-- some of the regions,
not the deserts, obviously.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.680
Some of the regions we do have
high population densities,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.180
like sub-Saharan Africa,
but don't have a whole lot

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.290
of electricity use right now.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.150
Then we'll take another map,
which is the solar resource.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.740
Again here, the
red is indicating

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.170
a lot of solar resource.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.430
And the blue is
indicating not so much.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.610
But still, it's pretty
amazing that the entire world

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.290
is falling within
about a factor of two,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.010
maybe a factor of three.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.040
So even if you
compare Scandinavia

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.400
against-- let's say,
Scandinavia against Kenya,

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.910
you're still looking at about a
variation of a factor of three,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.310
right?

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.140
So the solar resource
is pretty well

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.069
matched with the regions
of the world that

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.360
don't have electricity right
now, where the demand will

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.730
be coming online.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.410
And to put that into
another nice chart,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.480
I don't think this
is very common yet.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.260
You've seen the HDI
versus per capita income.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.530
But this is HDI
versus insulation,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.180
showing that those regions of
the world that are ranked lower

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.410
on the HDI scale are
precisely those regions that

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.570
have higher insulation,
that have greater

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.740
access to that solar resource.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.370
Now the big question is, is
that solar resource big enough

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.530
to supply necessary
energy needs.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.480
And this is a quick intro to
next lecture, where we discuss

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.260
the solar resource in detail.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.390
But the short answer
is absolutely,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.070
yes, by orders of magnitude.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.150
The volumes of these
cubes represent

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.980
the volume of either energy
resource or energy need.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.190
Energy need here,
on the far right--

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.980
that little blue cube
represents the human energy use.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.920
Some are very small compared
to the solar resource

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.060
on the Earth's surface.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.547
This obviously is including
the ocean as well.

00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:11.880
If we're to be realistic,
instead of calling this planet

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.110
Earth, we should probably
call it ocean or water

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.100
since oceans do
comprise about 2/3.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.820
But even if we discount
this for usable land area,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.700
we're still an
order of magnitude

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.200
greater than total
human energy use.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.920
So the resource base is there.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.770
It's available.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.020
It's up to us to figure
out how to use it, up to us

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.540
scientists and engineers.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.630
So the potential
for solar energy

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.740
is represented on this chart.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.166
I'm not a huge
fan of this chart,

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.760
and I'll explain
why in a minute.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.990
But there is something very
valuable to be taken away

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.489
from here.

00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:46.660
These black dots, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.550
represent around 18
terawatt equivalent,

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.850
which is total human energy
use in a few years time.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.571
And you can see the total land
area there is not astronomical.

00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:58.320
The reason I don't
like this chart so much

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.902
is because we're not going to
cover up vast swaths of Nevada,

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:03.860
for instance, with solar
panels for the benefit

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.160
of the rest of the country.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.260
We're going to distribute those
solar panels over larger areas.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.210
But this is just meant
to emphasize the point

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.610
that the land area usage
does work out in our favor.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.880
So the way we distribute
solar panels typically

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.560
is either on residential
installations, like this one,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.600
or in large field installations.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.400
This one, the Sarnia
Solar Farm in Ontario

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.440
is currently the largest
solar farm in the world.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.090
We call it a solar farm because
it's just a massive land

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.330
area comprised of solar panels.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.300
This is the covering half
of Nevada scenario, right?

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.450
This here on the left hand
side, on the other hand,

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.030
is a residential neighborhood
in California indicating

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.970
the more distributed variety.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.350
And both have their distinct
strengths and weaknesses.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.680
So solar isn't about those
small, little, rinky dinky,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.640
20 or 30 watt panels
that are sitting

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.260
on a remote thatched hut.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.330
Solar is really growing up to
be a grid tied, grid integrated,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.260
renewable energy source that
is now probably skirting a $100

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.360
billion industry worldwide.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.020
So it's growing up, and
certainly professionalizing

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.220
quite a bit.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.440
Historical perspective.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.959
It's time to take a
look back and trace

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:18.500
through some of the technical
history of how solar cells came

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.380
into being.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.310
And that really
will inform why it

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.830
is we're at where we are today,
why the industry has some

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.880
of the biases it
has today, and what

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.580
are some of the
intangible barriers that

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.940
could be needed to
be overcome if we are

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.390
to develop new technologies.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.890
So aside from just
general knowledge

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.800
and general edification, this
has an important technical

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.310
aspect as well.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.540
So historical perspective.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.400
We credit the discovery
of the photovoltaic

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.925
to this gentleman here,
Edmond Becquerel, shown here

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.020
in his more mature years.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.730
When he wrote this
article, right here-- I'll

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.820
probably butcher it, but it's
"sur les effets electriques

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.990
produit sous l'influence
des rayons solaires."

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.550
Basically, the
electrical effects

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.260
produced by the
influence of solar rays

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.380
on a contraption that
looked very similar to this.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.205
He noticed a current
flowing, essentially

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:20.540
a photovoltaic, a photon
induced, a light induced effect

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.410
current.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.310
And he was very smart to
decouple the effect of heat

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.220
from the light.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.350
So his experiment
involved selective filters

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.420
that prevented massive amounts
of heat from getting through.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.230
And he essentially produced
what is a spectral response.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.860
Varying the filter color,
he was able to trace out

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.750
the response of this
apparatus to the solar light

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.362
as a function of wavelength.

00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:45.570
This was a clever experiment.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.350
He wrote it up.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.000
It's more of an
electrochemical device

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.380
rather than the solid
state photovoltaic device,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.590
like the one we know now.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.410
But nevertheless, it
earned him the credit

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.160
of being the discoverer of
the photovoltaic effect.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.640
Does anybody happen to know
how old he was in 1839,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.325
when he discovered this or
when he published this work?

00:18:06.325 --> 00:18:07.450
It's a rather nice article.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.750
Very eloquent, very detailed.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.070
He was 19.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.760
He was born in 1820.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.750
Anyway, small aside.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.760
The field evolved
from 1839, when

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.930
that first article came out.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.290
Folks began refining
and-- well, first of all,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.820
discovering new elements during
that period in the 1800s,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.320
refining them and then
testing their properties.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.529
And this was before
we really understood

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:32.570
what semiconductors were.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.440
They were a little bit of
a black box, a big mystery.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.360
Their physical,
electrical properties

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.950
were all over the map.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.410
We'll explain why over the
course of the next 10 lectures.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.100
And they began refining
these materials

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.890
and putting them in various
contraptions testing them

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.630
with light.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.005
And lo and behold, they would
get the photovoltaic effect

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.720
again, maybe photoelectric
effect first, and then,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.390
the photovoltaic
effect, finally,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.790
when they set up the
experiment properly.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.310
And selenium was a popular
material at the beginning.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.520
So was cuprous oxide, Cu2O.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.970
That was a very common material.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.510
And I love pointing this out.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.000
This is a little
contraption, a vice.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.680
To hold the contact
onto the device.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.010
And as Joe can tell you,
contacting a solar cell

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.940
is not the easiest
thing in the world.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.850
So it's a pretty funny
picture, especially

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.290
in light of our current
difficulties in 2011

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.350
on resolving some contact
issues, especially

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.500
with new materials.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.410
But that gives you a little bit
of a historical perspective.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.960
And the references are there.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.900
In 1954, the first
embodiment of what

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.840
we consider the modern
solar cell came into being.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.545
This was driven by the
purification, crystallisation,

00:19:43.545 --> 00:19:47.510
and growth of silicon, which
is the second most abundant

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.050
element on the Earth's crust.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.920
It was noted to be
superior to germanium

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.525
for electronic devices because
of its larger band gap,

00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:56.430
less leakage current.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.250
We'll get to that
in a few lectures.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.700
It had superior properties.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.690
And it was engineered into,
I would say, the first

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.390
what we call a, homojunction
p-n junction based solar cell

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.770
device in Bell Labs by
those three gentleman there,

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.040
on the upper left.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.320
And in 1954, the paper
came out in the Journal

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.670
of Applied Physics.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.990
And that really spurred a
lot of interest in the field.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.720
Why?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.330
Because 6% efficiency
was about a factor

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.730
15 higher than anything
that had come before it.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.990
And now, people could see the
potential of this technology

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.930
to drive things.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.752
At the time, within a few
years, within a decade or so,

00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:37.210
folks were more interested in
sending satellites into space

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.660
than they were, perhaps,
powering terrestrial objects.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.530
But we'll get to
that in a second.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.380
But some of the
first examples here,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.180
in Bell Labs in
New Jersey-- they

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.490
had a small little
radio communicating

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.440
with this little
device, over here.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.810
And the solar cell was
powering the gadget.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.730
And it's interesting
to note here,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.120
the New York Times
article from that time,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.060
"with this modern version
of Apollo's Chariot,

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.480
the Bell scientists
have harnessed

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.854
enough of the
sun's rays to power

00:21:05.854 --> 00:21:08.590
the transmission of voices
over telephone wires."

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.670
And they speculate that
at some point-- obviously

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.860
this was written
in the 1950s, keep

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.699
that social context in mind.

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:18.740
"But eventually leading
to the realization of one

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.237
of mankind's most
cherished dreams,

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:21.820
the harnessing of
the almost limitless

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.230
energy of the sun for the
uses of civilization."

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.910
They saw the opportunity there.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.672
It was not lost to them.

00:21:27.672 --> 00:21:29.130
But of course, a
lot of development

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.840
had to come under the bridge.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.548
A lot of water had to
go under the bridge

00:21:32.548 --> 00:21:34.550
before they were able to
make solar really cost

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:39.520
effective from 1954 at
almost 60 years later.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.310
The way that basic
solar cell device

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.530
worked-- I'm going to introduce
you to the full picture now.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.730
And I will begin dissecting
it piece by piece,

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.480
over the next lectures,
so that we really

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.112
understand each component
of how the solar cell works.

00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:52.820
And we'll put it all
back together again.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.680
We'll actually
make it, literally.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.305
So the sunlight comes
into this device.

00:21:56.305 --> 00:21:58.810
This is a cross section
of a solar cell device.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.160
And today's modern solar
cells are about four times

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.590
the thickness of your hair.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.190
So if you can imagine
200 microns in thickness,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.580
that's the thickness
here, the cross section

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.950
of this solar cell device.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.770
Light comes inside,
excites bound charge,

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.610
and makes it mobile, so it
can move around the material.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.750
There's a built
in electric field,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.120
which serves to separate that
charge and create the voltage.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.420
And so one of the
charges goes here.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.222
The other charge
goes to the back.

00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:29.180
So you have a voltage or
a potential difference

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.685
across these two terminals,
across the front terminal

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:33.402
and across the back one.

00:22:33.402 --> 00:22:35.610
And then, if they're connected
by an external circuit

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.340
to an external
load, current will

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.850
flow through that external
load to complete the circuit.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:45.810
And that's essentially how
the solar cell device works.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.900
So three basic steps,
there's charge generation.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.069
So light is exciting
charge within the material.

00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:54.360
The second important step,
up there in the upper right,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.727
is charge separation.

00:22:55.727 --> 00:22:57.560
Somehow, you have to
induce a voltage inside

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.096
of your material.

00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:00.470
And the third very
important step

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.530
is somehow you have to collect
the charge coming out of it.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.600
That's why those folks
in the earlier days

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.470
had that big vice over here.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.164
They were trying
to really make sure

00:23:09.164 --> 00:23:11.330
that the metal was in good
contact with the material

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.010
so they could
extract the charge.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.860
And so that's essentially it.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.600
The advantages of a
solar cell devices

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.850
is that there are no moving
parts and no pollution created

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.480
at the site of use.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.640
There is, obviously,
the manufacturing

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.200
of the module itself.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.250
And we'll get into
detail about that,

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.140
and begin quantifying
the amount of energy,

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.140
the cost to manufacture it.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.150
Bottom line is that the CO2
production per unit energy

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.350
output from the solar panel is
on the order of 10 times less

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.930
than coal, 5 times
less natural gas,

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.630
so significantly less
than fossil fuel.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.790
It is not a zero energy system.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.060
The reason why the majority--
where the majority of that CO2

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.890
comes from is
actually the energy

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.830
used to produce the solar panel.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.600
So as we transition
to solar panels made

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.200
from other solar panels, as
the solar industry ramps up,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.700
obviously the carbon intensity
of producing the solar panels

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.270
will go down, as well.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.354
Likewise, it matters where
you produce the panels.

00:24:09.354 --> 00:24:11.186
There's some active
research going on at MIT

00:24:11.186 --> 00:24:12.630
to decide where
in the world it's

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.620
optimal to produce
the solar panels

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.830
and where it's optimal
to actually install them.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.180
The disadvantages,
which really embody

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.950
why we haven't seen a mass
of adoption of solar to date

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.870
and why there are technical and
nontechnical challenges for you

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.170
here to resolve
is because there's

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.212
no power output at night.

00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:35.003
In other words, when
the sun's not shining,

00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:36.420
it's not producing electricity.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.530
And there's lower output
when weather's unfavorable.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.640
And thirdly, today
there's a high cost.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.940
We'll get to that in
a few slides as well.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.320
So it's not economically
competitive in most markets.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.360
In some, there are.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.850
In 1.5 out of the 50
states here in US,

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:53.830
solar is cost
competitive, today.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.970
But in the remainder, it's not.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.450
So this is the really fun part.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.800
This is why when you
pick up your phone,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.630
and text your parents, and
say I'm in a PV course.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.442
And they write
back, ah, PV, I've

00:25:07.442 --> 00:25:08.650
heard about that for decades.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.650
That's an old hat.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.760
That's not going anywhere.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.100
You can write back and say
it's very different today

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.200
than it was then.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.060
And here's the reason why.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.660
In the 1970s, when
PV really started

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.237
to take off for civilian
purposes-- obviously,

00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:23.820
they had put satellites
up into space.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.550
They had proven that it worked.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.920
It was robust.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.360
In microwave relay stations up
in remote locations, that they

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.440
didn't want to service, they
also would place PV panels.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.930
But in terms of civilian
purposes on houses

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.965
and so forth, really
late 1970s, early 1980s

00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:41.180
were where things were
beginning to take off.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.100
And driven by the oil crisis.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.190
The OPEC oil crisis of 1970s.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.430
This is a New York
Times article describing

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.550
the state of the art of solar.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.420
This is taking a look some
20 years later at solar

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.360
and saying how far have we come.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.190
And one of the interesting
things of note in this article,

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.530
right here, is
that it cost upward

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.750
of $10 a watt for the solar
panels, in that day in 1979.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.700
Meaning it would
take, roughly, $12,000

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.550
to run an ordinary
household toaster.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.630
So that was the
impression that folks

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.990
had of solar in the 1970s.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.610
And for good reason.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:21.910
This is the cost of electricity
produced of solar versus time.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.040
In reality, the x-axis,
if you look closely,

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.620
it's cumulative PV
electricity production.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.840
That means for each
new panel we make

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.780
and for each new unit of energy
that that panel is producing,

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.910
the cost of electricity
is coming down.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.940
That's because we learned
how to make panels better.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.492
We learned how to make cheaper
panels faster, with less cost.

00:26:44.492 --> 00:26:46.700
So the cost of the electricity
reproduced, over here,

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.970
is showing going down with time.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.815
And this is a
little bit of apples

00:26:50.815 --> 00:26:52.190
to oranges
comparison, that's why

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.523
they're two different colors
for the two different dots.

00:26:54.523 --> 00:26:57.850
The black dots represent the
average retail electricity

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:58.670
prices.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.809
Not costs, but price.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:02.350
This is going to be
a repeating theme

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.460
throughout the entire course.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.750
I'm going to emphasize it now.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.416
Can somebody tell me
what the difference

00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:08.581
between cost and price is?

00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:10.455
AUDIENCE: Price is going
to be more than cost

00:27:10.455 --> 00:27:13.664
because the company wants to
make a profit on the product.

00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:14.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.220
So let's see I make a gizmo--
this is a great example.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.960
I make a gizmo that costs a
certain amount, x, let's say.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.310
And now, I sell it for 3x.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.980
And I make 2x profit.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.560
So the price would be 3x.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.360
The cost would be x.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.590
And so the cost of solar is
shown here in the white dots.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.260
And the price of retail
electricity price is in black.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.370
Why is this comparison
made right here?

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.270
Why would somebody do
that sort of apples

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.402
to oranges comparison?

00:27:44.402 --> 00:27:45.860
What point are they
trying to make?

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.180
AUDIENCE: Because we
need to bring down

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.450
how much we need to
put into PV to be at

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.042
to compete with the price
that electricity is at,

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.989
as opposed to cost.

00:27:58.989 --> 00:27:59.780
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.000
This is a substitution
play, right?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.050
You're looking at
PV substituting what

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.860
is, in that case, the
base load and peaking

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.790
price of electricity--
probably more driven

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.905
by the peaking price
of electricity.

00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:14.280
And so what they're
doing here is

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.660
they're saying,
OK, how much does

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.480
it cost to manufacture
this panel,

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.261
and how does that
compare against the grid

00:28:21.261 --> 00:28:23.010
if I were to plug into
the wall over there

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.593
and extract electricity
from the grid.

00:28:24.593 --> 00:28:27.565
How much would that cost me?

00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:29.876
How much would I have to
pay for that electricity?

00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.750
And that's really the
comparison that they're

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.874
trying to drive right here.

00:28:32.874 --> 00:28:35.680
AUDIENCE: Does that
adjust for inflation?

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.770
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.520
The details are in
this paper, right here.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.350
Again, you can access all
this information online.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.980
But it is adjusted.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.810
These are, I believe,
in 2002 prices.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.055
I can't remember
the exact-- yeah.

00:28:49.055 --> 00:28:52.025
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
assumptions used to compute

00:28:52.025 --> 00:28:56.000
the cost of PV and electricity?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.630
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:02.520
So the higher density of
data points, over here,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.680
is in part because they
get closer together.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.770
It becomes harder to
drive the cost down.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.490
And of course, we were
looking at it in a log scale.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.040
But also, the
quality of the data

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.999
is much better in recent
years because we had access

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:19.540
to-- greater number
of companies were

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.790
able to average values
coming from multiple sources.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:27.930
Some of the earlier
data, especially 1957--

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.830
those were some of the
first solar cells produced.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.727
If they had access
to good primary data,

00:29:34.727 --> 00:29:36.310
those numbers would
be highly accurate

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.059
because it would be
one company making it.

00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:38.730
And that's it.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:39.990
Very little error bar.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.730
But if they were
making guesstimates

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.640
based on material
cost of the day,

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.030
then there would be some error
bar associated with that data

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.070
point.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.910
These curves are very
difficult to produce

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.520
when you're in academia.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.550
But I can say that when
we were in industry,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.310
we did this for our company
just for hahas one day.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.280
And it fell on a
very similar slope--

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.940
with a similar slope
and a similar value.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.997
So somehow they were
getting the numbers right.

00:30:08.997 --> 00:30:12.829
AUDIENCE: In terms
of insulation,

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:15.328
what numbers are you using to
assume-- like you said, do you

00:30:15.328 --> 00:30:17.763
use values for
Nevada or do you take

00:30:17.763 --> 00:30:21.659
an average of the summation
of the entire US-- US

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:25.080
average for the retail
electricity prices.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.090
PROFESSOR: And so the
retail electricity

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.010
prices in the United
States vary quite a bit.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.570
You have some coal rich
states, like Wyoming, that

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.260
get $0.05 per kilowatt hour.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.630
You have states
like Massachusetts

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.204
at the end of the
energy pipeline.

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.870
If you look at the
natural gas pipeline,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:41.910
for example, we're
at the very end.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.360
We get some of our natural
gas even shipped in by boat.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.640
$0.18 per kilowatt hour
is residential prices.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.641
And in California, which
has a tiered structure,

00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:51.890
if you're one of the highest
consumers of electricity,

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.070
you're going to be paying
somewhere around $0.30 per

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.840
kilowatt hour compared to some
of the lower use folks down

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.760
around $0.12.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.330
And so, it varies quite a bit.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.810
Typically, when you're looking
at these sorts of charts,

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.950
if the chart is produced,
say, by the USDOE

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.390
or some solar
promoter, let's say,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.200
they will typically be choosing
a rosy scenario of the American

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.530
Southwest because
that is-- well,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.190
not only do the numbers look
better but, more importantly,

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.314
that's where a lot of the
solar is being installed,

00:31:21.314 --> 00:31:24.560
today, but not all of the solar.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.820
Because it is a substitution
economics situation,

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.460
two parameters are
really of interest

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.230
that drive the cost
competitiveness

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.540
of the solar installation.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.180
One is the retail
price of electricity.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.894
How much are you
paying out of the wall?

00:31:37.894 --> 00:31:39.310
What are you
substituting it with?

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.170
And the second is how much
sunlight you get locally.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.290
So our break even point in
the state of Massachusetts

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.360
is not too far off from
Arizona because they

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.510
have a lot cheaper
price of electricity

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.975
even though we have
a lot less sun.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.380
So I wanted to emphasize
a couple more points.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.500
So when Gregory Nemet
put together this chart,

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.230
it was within the context of
a really interesting paper

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.550
in which he attempted to
decouple the effects of scale

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.705
from innovation.

00:32:11.705 --> 00:32:13.000
Let me emphasize that.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.710
So if you are making
a widget-- let's

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.730
imagine a razor, like Gillette
does here in South Boston,

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.600
or if you're making
some other high tech

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.760
product-- razors by the
way are very high tech.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.510
How many times have you cut
yourself by a defective razor?

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.610
I certainly haven't, and I've
probably used tens of thousands

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.532
in my lifetime of
individual blades.

00:32:33.532 --> 00:32:34.990
And that's because
they're examined

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.070
using laser technology.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.164
They're really manufactured
in a high tech way.

00:32:38.164 --> 00:32:40.080
And they get better and
better every time they

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.880
produce one razor blade.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.380
And so they follow
a learning curve,

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.830
just like photovoltaics does.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.290
With cumulative production, the
cost of producing one widget

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.160
goes down.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.710
And likewise, microwave ovens
and other high tech products.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.430
And so the big question is,
how much of this learning curve

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.640
cost reduction is
driven by innovation

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.240
and how much is driven by
scaling-- just learning

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.699
how to do incremental
improvements,

00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:08.198
tweaking the manufacturing line
to make it a little bit more

00:33:08.198 --> 00:33:09.130
efficient.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.200
So Gregorian Nemet, the author
of this paper right here,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.590
in which this figure appears,
looked into that question

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.490
and came up with some answers.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.980
Some of those learnings
were incorporated

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.860
onto this beautiful chat
here produced by 1366,

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.280
a spinoff from MIT focused on
commercializing really cool

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.000
next-gen PV product.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.780
They took that learning curve
from Gregory Nemet's paper,

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.590
plotted in a slightly
different scale,

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.080
and showed several of the
technology innovations

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.280
that drove down that learning
curve for crystalline silicon.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.180
And so those, in
the fine text there,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.990
represent specific technologies.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.890
And we'll be getting
to know some of them

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.550
over the course
of the PV course.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.800
And so, we're approaching
this very interesting point.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.883
If you haven't noticed
from this chart right here,

00:33:55.883 --> 00:33:57.050
this ended in 2003.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.450
And boy, these two are getting
very close to one another.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.870
We're entering a very
interesting point

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.080
where the cost of
producing PV electricity

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.719
is rapidly intersecting with the
US retail electricity prices.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.840
And that is represented in
a very broad brush strokes

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.110
by this DOE chart that was
produced in approximately 2006

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.520
with the Solar America
Initiative, where

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.989
you have the system price
range for PV systems.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:27.429
Again, broad range now,
instead of finite data points.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.199
Residential and commercial
rates and utility generation.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.730
For those who have already
dealt with electricity markets,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.354
the residential
commercial rates-- this

00:34:35.354 --> 00:34:37.699
is the price or
the retail price.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.460
And the utility generation,
this is more the wholesale price

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.690
over here for utility scale.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:47.530
So again, just showing you
the range of substitutions

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:48.973
that could be going on.

00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:50.639
And we're entering
the regime now where,

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:54.810
finally, solar is starting
to be cost competitive.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.560
And when you start having
this sort of interaction,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.930
you can imagine two Gaussian
curves, one curve representing

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.980
the price of solar and the
other the price of electricity.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.160
And as they begin overlapping,
as the price of our electricity

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.320
goes up-- it went up
15% over the 2000s

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.040
here in Massachusetts,
the retail price

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.770
of electricity in residential.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.480
And as the price of
solar comes down,

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.950
those two Gaussian curves begin
moving against each other.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.460
And at the edge
of a Gaussian, you

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.960
can model that using
an exponential.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.730
And so you have two
exponential curves overlapping.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.450
You have, effectively, an
exponentially growing market

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.160
penetration.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.360
In other words, the solar
adoption on the grid

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.010
is following a
hockey stick curve.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.840
And that's why you hear a lot
of interest in solar these days.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.100
We had a solar system
installed in our house in 2007.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.790
And now, our neighbors
put them up last year.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.090
The folks across are putting
them up, actually, just

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.050
last week.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.758
And there's another
family down the road.

00:35:50.758 --> 00:35:54.050
So our little neighborhood is
representing this little hockey

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.894
stick, right here, as is
Cambridge as a whole and some

00:35:56.894 --> 00:35:58.310
of the places in
the United States

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.597
where it does make
economic sense.

00:36:00.597 --> 00:36:02.180
You're beginning to
see that take off.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.090
And that's why it's such
an exciting time right now.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.650
This is a much busier chart.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.330
There's a lot going on.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.690
But to sensitize you, this
is the PV residential.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.850
In other words, it's either
the cost or the price

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.400
to install PV on a
residential home.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.480
In other words, it's
a smaller system.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.240
So there's a larger
overhead per system.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.170
The architect needs
to spend more time

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.245
per unit energy produced to
design your system because it's

00:36:27.245 --> 00:36:28.576
a smaller one.

00:36:28.576 --> 00:36:32.780
A lot of people go out there
per panel to install it.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.140
Whereas PV utility, those large
fields filled with PV panels,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.620
it's cheaper per unit
panel to install.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.835
One architect can sit down
and design the whole thing--

00:36:42.835 --> 00:36:43.970
maybe a team of architects.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.290
But the overhead
costs are lower.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.920
And you can bargain with
the module manufacturers

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.640
to get a better rate
on your modules.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.050
So get a better price.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.120
And as a result, the PV
utility costs and prices

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.640
tend to be lower
than PV residential.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.140
And the blue and the
red, here, just represent

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.974
the wholesale and retail
electricity costs--

00:37:04.974 --> 00:37:07.140
what they're substituting
here in the United States.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.160
So a bit more
detailed chart, again,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.760
showing the grid penetration
down here at the bottom.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.350
Also, in terms of percent.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.900
So back here, a few
years ago, the 0.2%

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.450
of total worldwide electricity
was generated by photovoltaics.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.310
And projections are that by
2020, we'll be at around 1%,

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.740
by 2030 around 5% using these
just two overlapping Gaussian

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.580
curves.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.660
And it's interesting to
note that this is global.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.780
On a local level,
Germany has already

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.560
well surpassed 2% in Bavaria.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.700
I think it might be up 3%
or 4% now in photovoltaics,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.940
in the southeastern
region of Germany.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.040
There's a small island in
the Hawaiian chain that

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.020
has, I believe in peak days,
around 40% of its electricity

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.390
produced from solar.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.100
So there are regions
that already, you

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.240
have a very large percentage
of the total electricity being

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.345
produced by solar because of
that distribution of prices.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.700
And lastly, this is a
really exciting chart.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.380
This is the convergence between
PV and conventional energy--

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.070
essentially, what
this chart over here

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.780
was attempting to capture
in its percentages.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.650
This is explicitly
laid out, now.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.950
And I took data going
back to the 1970s,

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.660
and plotted the average
terawatts installed

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.790
of new PV installations
versus total primary energy--

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.470
new primary energy
installations.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.880
So for those energy wonks
here in the audience, what

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.540
is the primary energy
burn rate in the world,

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.230
right now, in terms
of terawatts average?

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.930
Around 15, right?

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.230
And so the average
new energy installed

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:50.840
each year is represented here.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.520
It's somewhere between 100
gigawatts and a terawatt,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.720
typically.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.850
And this is the new PV installs.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.570
You can see that we're within
about two orders of magnitude,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.520
now, of total new
energy installs.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.270
This is primary energy.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.440
For electricity, it
looks even rosier.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.190
And so we're rapidly
approaching the point

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.520
where substitution will begin.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.780
We're going to
start replacing, not

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.010
only we're going
to take a larger

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.730
share of total new
installed energy,

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.060
but we may even start
putting some existing power

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.250
plants out of business.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.430
And we'll get into that
in the economic section

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.884
in the third part of our course.

00:39:27.884 --> 00:39:30.300
Interesting to note, these
three distinct phases of growth

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.770
of the industry over time.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.330
Phase one was right
at the beginning,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.520
when we had the OPEC
oil crises, when people

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.603
were really interested in
solar, but it was really

00:39:37.603 --> 00:39:38.620
a boutique thing.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:44.820
And solar cute, great PR,
but not really impactful.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.330
In this regime, right here,
where most of you were born,

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.340
solar went kind of
through a down cycle.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.020
So while the price of
oil was really high,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.860
right back here, it
crashed in the early 1980s.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.360
And symbolically,
Ronald Reagan ended up

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.020
taking down the solar
panels from the White House

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.650
some time in '86, '87.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.950
And big oil companies
were the ones

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.410
who kept the solar industry
going, interestingly enough.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:11.340
It was Mobil-Tyco.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.840
It was BP Solar.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.090
The largest companies that
were producing solar panels

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:19.350
in the world were ones that were
small divisions of larger oil

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.840
companies, which viewed
themselves as energy companies.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.760
And then finally,
this phase three,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.140
this really rapid growth here.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.830
Again, a cumulative
annual growth

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.430
rate somewhere between
40% and 50% average.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:34.240
That took off when generous
government subsidies,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.850
whether it be for
the manufacturing

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.836
or the installation.

00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:39.210
In the case of
the United States,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.780
it's mostly been on
the installation side.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.238
In the case of
China's, it's mostly

00:40:42.238 --> 00:40:43.600
been on the manufacturing side.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.340
Japan and Germany
had a bit of both,

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.810
but more heavily toward
the installation.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.154
And we saw a massive
growth of the PV industry

00:40:51.154 --> 00:40:53.320
because, now, the government's
realized, well, wait,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.920
the cost is coming down, and
we will need new electricity

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.060
coming on board.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.367
And our oil supply is
a little unreliable.

00:41:00.367 --> 00:41:01.950
So let's invest in
this new technology

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.420
and see where it takes us.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.130
And I think the Germans,
now, are paying somewhere

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.250
on the order of a euro,
maybe a little over euro,

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.430
per month on their
electricity bills

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.590
as a result of having financed
a lot of this growth right

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.930
here in the PV industry, which
allowed the costs to come down

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.710
for the entire world.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.130
So it was a successful program.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.470
And as a result, many
pure play companies

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.640
saw the financial opportunities.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.360
The case Q Cells, which
is highlighted down here,

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.100
is not unusual in those days.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.820
In the late 1990s, a group
of executives at McKinsey

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.050
got together and
said, wow, the numbers

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.150
look really promising
in the solar business.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.550
Why don't we form
our own company

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.500
and only do solar
instead of being

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.480
part of a much larger
one where they have

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.110
their interests dispersed among
many different product lines

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.090
and technologies?

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.730
Let's focus
exclusively on solar,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.150
burn our bridges behind
us, and just go for it.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.040
And they went for it.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.726
And for a while,
for a few months

00:41:55.726 --> 00:41:58.100
Q Cells was the largest solar
cell producer in the world.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.950
It was, I would
say, a poster child

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.580
of this new generation
of PV companies

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.310
coming in this third phase here.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:12.250
And as we'll learn over the
course of this semester's

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.780
course, many of the
leading solar producers

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.380
today are now located in China.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.524
So this is, basically, the
history of PV development.

00:42:21.524 --> 00:42:23.690
And the important thing to
note is this closing gap,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:24.620
right here.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.509
So when folks are saying solar,
it's the same old, same old.

00:42:27.509 --> 00:42:28.300
It's been gimmicky.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.410
It's been around
for a long time,

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:30.620
but it's not going anywhere.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.620
You can point to some of
this data and, say, no.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.240
Actually, it's on the cusp.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.660
It really is
beginning to take off.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.890
And these are some
of the data you can

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.720
point to if you care to do so.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.710
Let me spend a few minutes
talking about the broader

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:49.230
picture beyond just
solar photovoltaics

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.710
into some of the other
solar technologies.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.710
We won't be addressing
too many of these

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.075
over the course of the lecture
because we have to focus

00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:58.150
and we have to become
very good at something,

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.787
otherwise we spread
ourselves to thin.

00:42:59.787 --> 00:43:01.620
But I did want to give
you a sense of what's

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.120
out there so that you can
situate solar photovoltaics

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.730
within a broader context.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.030
And so this is a solar
energy technology framework

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.900
that encompasses all conversion
technologies from sunlight

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.470
into energy.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.340
And so first off, I start with
a rationale for framework.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.160
Why invest the time to
come up a the framework?

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.820
I'll explain why.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.360
There are several hundreds
of technologies out there

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.280
that can convert
sunlight into energy.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.750
And to make sense of
the technology space

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.360
and to provide some meaningful
technology assessments,

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.610
there have to be some
performance driven,

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.090
technology neutral
performance metrics

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.130
that you can use to evaluate
one technology against another.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.470
And that's why coming up
with some sort of framework

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.460
is very helpful.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.350
So the three criteria
that I chose together

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.010
with Vladimir Bulovic
when we put the together,

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.770
to design a technology
framework was

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.630
an exhaustive categorisation.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.550
In other words, our framework
had to encompass more than 90%

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.002
of all technologies out there.

00:43:59.002 --> 00:43:59.960
The 30 years challenge.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.700
Again, in 30 years,
the PV technologies

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.110
should be able to fit
into this framework still.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.930
And it should be a
useful analysis tool.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.140
It should be able
to give insight

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.330
into the complex space
that's out there,

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.780
and allow folks, like
yourselves, to make sense

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.250
of it, whether you're trying
to develop cost models

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.580
or if you're trying to
develop technology prospectus.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.870
This should allow you to
gain a foothold in it.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.320
So we have solar energy
conversion technology.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.350
And we chose an output
oriented rationale

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.810
for dividing the solar
energy conversion space.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.912
So the output would be either
electricity, heat, or heat

00:44:34.912 --> 00:44:37.370
which is then used to power,
say, a turbine which generates

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.960
electricity, or fuels.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.857
And those are the four primary
outputs of solar energy, today.

00:44:43.857 --> 00:44:45.440
Yes, there are
technologies out there,

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.430
for example, that convert
sunlight and store it

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.960
in some way and convert
light on the other end.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.660
But we're not including
those in here because,

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.310
again, the 90% rule.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.560
We're focusing on
the major ones.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.700
And then, we do a
further subdivision

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.520
between the non-tracking
and tracking.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.149
Tracking means if
the sun is moving

00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:04.940
through the sky over
the course of the day,

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.850
your apparatus is
following the sun so as

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.320
to maximize the cross section
between the incoming rays

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.760
in your device.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.890
The reason we chose
tracking non-tracking

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.350
is because tracking
requires motors,

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.900
which will add cost and
reliability questions

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.180
to your system considerations.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.860
And that's why we chose this
further division right here.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.140
So on to the assessment.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.181
Let's look at the technologies
that are out there

00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:31.470
and try to bin them.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.814
Solar to electricity.

00:45:32.814 --> 00:45:33.980
There are a few embodiments.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.165
There's the photovoltaic
device, these ones.

00:45:36.165 --> 00:45:37.540
There's the
thermoelectric device

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.570
as well, which convert
solar energy into heat,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.196
really, and then heat
into electricity.

00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:44.320
So maybe it should have
been in the other category.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.014
But it is a device that converts
solar energy into electricity.

00:45:47.014 --> 00:45:48.430
So we've seen a
solar cell device.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.240
We've learned the three steps,
charge generation, charge

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.670
separation, charge collection.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.330
And we look at the
existing technologies that

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.520
are out there, today,
and say, all right,

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.140
let's start to bin them.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.950
We have non-tracking systems
that can be non-concentrating,

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.280
like these panels right here.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.030
Essentially, they're
just flat panels that

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.450
are receiving the sun's rays.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.130
Or, you can have cheap,
mirror-like materials

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:16.020
that bounce the sunlight off
of them into the solar panels

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.490
and concentrate sunlight.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.690
So let's imagine we
put a set of mirrors

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.690
on either side of this
panel, right here.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.070
And when the sunlight
bounced into the mirror,

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:24.611
it would reflect
back into the panel.

00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:28.110
That would be a concentrating,
but non-tracking, system.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:34.420
And these are common on barriers
along the highway in Germany.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.510
They're sound barriers.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.450
They're preventing
the people who

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.690
live on the other
side of that barrier

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.436
from hearing the noise of the
cars going by on the Audubon.

00:46:40.436 --> 00:46:42.060
They're not meant to
be crash barriers.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.620
Those are separate,
closer to the actual road.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.110
But these are examples of
concentrating and non-tracking

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.440
photovoltaics.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.810
There are ground mounted
and roof mounted systems.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.130
So again, another
way to split the pie.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:00.240
In the concentrating
non-tracking system,

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.990
there aren't only
these types, there

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.330
are a variety of other
species of concentrating

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.200
non-tracking devices as well.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.900
There are so-called
sliver cells--

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.540
which the light comes in,
bounces around a little bit,

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.110
and then eventually gets
absorbed by the device.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:18.140
And that even happens, to some
degree, in these modules, too.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.261
Because the light
comes in-- make sure

00:47:20.261 --> 00:47:21.760
I don't reflect
this into your face.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760
There we go.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.542
Point it up.

00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:25.500
The light can come in
sometimes and reflect off

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.100
of this white back skin.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.640
If the light is coming in
at an oblique enough angle,

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.990
total internal
reflection by the glass.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.430
It'll get a second bounce
and go into the device.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.720
We'll talk about how that
works in a couple of lectures.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.230
So internal reflections.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:46.040
And this is particularly timely.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.380
Does anybody know--
does the word Solyndra

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.300
ring a bell for anybody?

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:51.800
Yeah.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.040
What about Solyndra?

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.211
AUDIENCE: It went bust.

00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:55.210
PROFESSOR: It went bust.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.055
So it's one of the
three photovoltaics

00:47:58.055 --> 00:47:59.680
start up companies
in the United States

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.230
that went bust over the past few
months over this past summer.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.330
And that's a really
interesting market dynamic,

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.770
which we'll get to in the
third part of this course.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.750
And we'll discuss that
head on because it's

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.680
an interesting,
and very important

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.580
dynamic in the evolution
of the solar industry.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.420
We have some technologies
under development at MIT.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.520
Marc Baldo's lab and
Vladimir Bulovic and others

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.080
are working on devices that
absorb sunlight, reemit

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.580
the light at a
different wavelength,

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.641
trap it inside of some high
index medium, like glass,

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:32.140
and then, ultimately,
concentrate it

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.960
on to the cells that
are on the corners.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.100
So you can imagine a
window that absorbs

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.120
some of the incoming
light, bounces light

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.985
off, and eventually concentrates
the light in the corners where

00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:42.360
you have your
solar cell devices.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.151
The advantages, or the
potential advantage,

00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:46.970
here is that you can have
a very high efficiency,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.060
expensive device, but a
very small area of it.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.370
Instead of covering this
entire area right here,

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.820
you've now reduced
the total area.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.770
And then, if this is a
very small percentage

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.430
of the total system
cost, you can just

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.846
switch it right out when a new
and better technology comes

00:49:01.846 --> 00:49:04.900
along, almost like you
switch out your computer.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.780
So if a better solar
cell device comes along,

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.863
you can take this one out
and put the next one in.

00:49:08.863 --> 00:49:10.852
It's almost like an
upgradable system

00:49:10.852 --> 00:49:12.560
because the majority
of the embedded cost

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.690
is in the concentrator and not
the solar cell device itself.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.670
Again, just really drinking out
of the fire hose this morning.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.640
We're drilling you
with data, but it's

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.600
meant to begin to sensitize
you to some of the terms

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.180
and some of the ways of
thinking here in the field.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.209
Tracking.

00:49:28.209 --> 00:49:29.750
So when we're talking
about tracking,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.390
there's a rise in the
number of tracking systems

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.830
in the United States.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.900
It is shown with high
efficiency modules

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.755
that it can be more
cost competitive

00:49:37.755 --> 00:49:39.710
if you have a large
field installation to do

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.390
one axis tracking.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.417
One axis tracking and
two axis tracking.

00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:45.250
Why would you want one
or two axis tracking?

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.480
What are you tracking?

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.320
One axis tracking.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.850
What would make sense to
track with a one axis?

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:52.430
If you had one axis to choose,
would you rotate east west?

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.050
Would you rotate north south?

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.429
Would you rotate
northwest to southeast?

00:49:56.429 --> 00:49:57.220
Where would you go?

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.310
AUDIENCE: East to west.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.310
PROFESSOR: East to west.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.120
Why is that?

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.170
[CLASS MURMURS]

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.210
PROFESSOR: Because
you're tracking the sun

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.335
over the course of the day.

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:06.750
And you're tracking, pretty
much, every day of the year.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.930
So 365 tracks per year.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.490
The two axis tracking,
what is this other axis?

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.780
Presumably, it's orthogonal
to the east west.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.040
In other words, north south.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.740
Why would you want
to track north south?

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.670
Seasons, right?

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:25.460
Yeah so from winter to
summer, you're tracking.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:29.900
So you would always want your
solar panels facing south,

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.389
I guess, right?

00:50:31.389 --> 00:50:32.930
AUDIENCE: In the
northern hemisphere.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.790
PROFESSOR: In the
northern hemisphere.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:34.540
Exactly.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.630
So if you're in
Australia or in Brazil,

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.020
your solar panels
are facing north.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.759
So let's accustomize
ourselves with that.

00:50:42.759 --> 00:50:44.300
And the two axis
tracking, of course,

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.230
would allow for that adjustment.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.170
The reason one axis
tracking is taking off

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:54.000
as the most common field
installation tracking

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.346
system is because the
seasonal adjustment,

00:50:56.346 --> 00:50:58.970
if it really needs to be done--
it's not a huge energy benefit,

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.420
but if it really
needs to be done,

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.600
you can probably
just crank by hand

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.860
instead of using a machine or
a motor that can break down.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:10.780
And the adjustments still
need to be made very often.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.500
Non-concentrating
and concentrating PV.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.390
Tracking.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.250
So these are one axis
trackers, right here,

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.970
tracking over the course of
the day, but not concentrating.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.060
In other words, they're
flat panels like this,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.730
but just mounted
a one axis tracker

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.700
that follows the sun over
the course of the day.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.760
The system over here
is a two axis tracker

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.250
that includes little lenses
that are focusing the sunlight

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.210
onto tiny little cells.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:38.240
And again, very similar
idea that the solar cell

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.600
itself is high efficiency,
but it is a low percentage

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.760
of the total system cost.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.640
Non-concentrating and tracking.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.960
Again, several examples of that.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.377
You have fancy systems, two axis
trackers, again, most common.

00:51:57.377 --> 00:51:59.710
Can anybody guess what this
little gizmo is, right here?

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.709
We're going to get to
that in next lecture but--

00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:04.959
AUDIENCE: A solar sensor that
finds the position of the sun?

00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:05.750
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:07.240
Somehow, you have to
have a measuring device

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.290
if you have a tracker.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:09.840
It has to tell you
where the sun is.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.810
So this little
gizmo, right here,

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:12.268
is just making sure
that the panels

00:52:12.268 --> 00:52:13.790
are facing the right way.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:14.960
Awesome.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.210
So concentrating and tracking.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:18.630
Here's a closer look at
some of the Frenel lenses

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.920
that are used to
concentrate the light down.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:25.860
On some cheap microscope-- or
sorry, cheap magnifying glasses

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.800
they also use Frenel lenses.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.690
And so this is an example
of a low cost apparatus

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:37.450
here to concentrate the sunlight
onto your high efficiency cell.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.557
Solar to heat electricity.

00:52:38.557 --> 00:52:41.140
We're not going to talk too much
about this during the course.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.136
But just to sensitize
you-- that there

00:52:43.136 --> 00:52:45.510
are technologies out there
and some pretty exciting once.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.555
There are heat engines.

00:52:46.555 --> 00:52:48.180
In other words,
sunlight heats a fluid,

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:50.330
which moves a turbine or
a piston, either directly

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.420
or by heat exchanger.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.270
Heat exchangers.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.370
Thermoelectrics.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:56.360
Long wavelengths photovoltaics.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.490
These are devices
that convert the heat

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.630
portion of the solar
spectrum into usable energy.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.450
And there are hybrids that
are possible with these.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:09.230
So if you heat up a fluid, say,
a salt or a glycol solution,

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.050
then you can store the
energy in terms of heat.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.380
And if the stored
energy begins to decay

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.230
with time because
of poor insulation,

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.360
you can augment that
heat with natural gas

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.540
or with some other fossil fuel.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.290
So you get these hybrid,
renewable solar and natural gas

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.930
power plants that are
possible with the solar

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.750
to heat electricity.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.200
And there are some really
fancy designs out there.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.740
And I'm happy to dive
into these in more detail.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.240
The most common one
are sunlight coming

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.720
into some sort of reflector, and
then concentrating the sunlight

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.800
into a thin tube that contains
your high heat capacity

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.910
material, liquid
usually-- so a glycol

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.380
based liquid or even
a salt, sometimes.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.880
It has to have a
high heat capacity.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.255
In other words, it has to be
able to absorb a lot of heat

00:54:00.255 --> 00:54:01.610
and retain it.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.780
But it also has
to have, ideally,

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.790
a minimum amount of corrosion so
that the longevity of the parts

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.450
is sustained.

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:12.330
And you can see,
here, these tubes that

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:15.550
are running along here and going
down these fields of collectors

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.800
all the way to the other side.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.500
And somewhere off in the
distance is the heat exchanger.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.690
So that's solar thermal for you.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.610
We have parabolic dishes
concentrating sunlight

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.320
into Stirling engines.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.440
That's kind of neat.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:34.190
And so your T high is basically
that of generated by the sun.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.430
And you T low is the ambient.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.190
So typical mechanical
engineering there.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.449
And you also have
solar power towers.

00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:43.990
There's some work being done at
MIT in this as well with Alex

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:48.100
Slocum and others that are
using fields of mirrors

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.700
to concentrate the sunlight
into a tiny little spot,

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.685
right here, in a big tower.

00:54:52.685 --> 00:54:54.810
Say, for example, that spot
right there, it's dark.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:55.726
It's not in operation.

00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:57.674
But if it were, the sun
would be concentrated

00:54:57.674 --> 00:54:58.590
onto that little spot.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.899
It'd be really, really
bright, indicative

00:55:00.899 --> 00:55:02.690
of it's very high
temperature, on the order

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.350
of a couple thousand Kelvin.

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.660
And then the sunlight would
either be absorbed up here,

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.710
with some molten salt, or
reflected down underground

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.200
to a heat reservoir.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.740
And that would be your T
high running your engine.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.850
So your Carnot engine.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:22.550
And then the T low would
be the ambient temperature.

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:23.890
Solar to heat.

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:26.470
This is really important
in developing countries.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.850
Not to be overlooked, the very
simple, low tech conversion

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.770
of sunlight into heat.

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:33.190
You can heat water.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.450
This is very, very
common on rooftops

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.630
all throughout the
sunbelt of the planet.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:39.720
You'll see these on the
roof, painted in black.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:45.490
They contain potable water,
typically used for either,

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:48.060
say, for example,
showers or kitchen use.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.410
And the fancier
versions that are really

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.960
marvels of engineering.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.260
These materials all
have to be coefficient

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.230
of thermal expansion matched.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:01.290
As it heats up, the
glass tubing has

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.420
to match the expansion
of the metal around it.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.920
So it is quite a
feat of engineering

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.000
that they make these so well.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.500
There are a few
companies in Germany

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.210
that really pioneered
this effort right here.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.550
Of course, you have tracking
versions, like solar ovens.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.080
Not too common.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.424
You typically find more still
in developing countries.

00:56:21.424 --> 00:56:23.590
Unfortunately, you find a
lot of wood burning, which

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.680
isn't good for the cook,
which, unfortunately,

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.040
most often is female.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.120
And so this illustrates some
of these societal questions

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.380
that solar involves.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.110
It's not just the technology.

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:38.790
This involves gender equality.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.870
This involves
societal development.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:44.930
This is a much broader topic
than just the fundamentals

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:47.202
of the physics of how the
solar cell device works

00:56:47.202 --> 00:56:48.910
or how sunlight is
converted into energy.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:52.230
And that's why we have the
three segments of the course.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.840
Lastly, solar to fuels.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.910
The way I've traditionally
broken it down--

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.490
it's a little bit wishy washy--
is into enthalpy and entropy

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:03.120
in the sense that,
in enthalpy, you're

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.340
storing the sunlight in
bonds-- in chemical bonds.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.150
The bonds are
forming-- more complex,

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:12.000
higher energy molecules
are being created.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.510
So you're taking water and
splitting into the gases.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:18.011
Or you're taking CO2 and
water and converting it

00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:18.760
into hydrocarbons.

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.970
And those can be used
to store the fuel

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:28.140
and, ultimately, release it in
the form of burning the fuel.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.130
So it's a closed loop cycle.

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.710
And what I refer to
as entropy, which

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.700
I get some flack from the
folks in chemistry for,

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.220
is the separation of phases,
in other words, desalination.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:41.450
If you separate your
salts from your water,

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:44.530
then you're increasing
the energy of your system.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.500
You're doing a
physical separation.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.540
And it is a form
of energy storage.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.540
So this right here is the
example of the renewable fuel

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.510
cycle where you
have sunlight coming

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.400
into your starting compounds.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.162
Using some catalyst,
typically, you're

00:57:59.162 --> 00:58:00.620
creating the
intermediate compound,

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.000
which is a solar fuel.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.370
Then you burn your solar fuel.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.828
Then you have your
final compounds.

00:58:04.828 --> 00:58:06.467
In the ideal world, 5 equals 1.

00:58:06.467 --> 00:58:08.550
The final compounds are
identical to the beginning

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:09.050
compounds.

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.510
And you have a closed loop
cycle, a renewable cycle.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:14.500
And so a lot of work is
going on here at MIT.

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.333
This is a recent paper
we published together

00:58:16.333 --> 00:58:17.700
with Dan Nocera.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.710
His group is looking to
special types of catalysts.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.030
Our group makes solar cells.

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:24.810
So we work together to make
these nifty little devices that

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.084
convert sunlight
into storable fuels.

00:58:27.084 --> 00:58:29.000
What you see here are
little bundles coming up

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.790
from the water in which the
solar cell device is embedded.

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.350
The water is near pH neutral.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:36.450
Then it's converting
that sunlight into gas,

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:40.491
into hydrogen and oxygen,
which can then be stored.

00:58:40.491 --> 00:58:41.990
On one side of the
device, you could

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:44.200
be creating oxygen. On the other
side, hydrogen, for instance,

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.870
if you have a
physical separator,

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:48.642
you'd be able to store
that electricity.

00:58:48.642 --> 00:58:50.475
This is an example-- a
very simple example--

00:58:50.475 --> 00:58:52.360
of desalination driven by solar.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.750
There are much fancier
examples, as well.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.100
But that gives you an idea.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.910
You have contaminated
or salty water.

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:00.690
And you're
evaporating the water.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.120
It dribbles down into this
little collector over here,

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.660
and finally out into your
collecting pot, leaving

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.390
the salty, brine behind.

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:12.450
And then in the
broader perspective,

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:15.850
we have many other issues beside
just the conversion technology

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:16.760
itself.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.610
We have how do we
use the electricity

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.150
and how do we store it.

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:25.930
Is the solar power generation
centralized and all the users

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:29.130
distributed, similar to
how we produce power today?

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:31.600
Do we have one big solar field
that's producing electricity

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.780
for all of Cambridge,
or do we have

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.860
the individual solar panels
in each of our houses

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.450
that are producing
the power locally,

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:40.360
and they're all interconnected?

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.443
In case a cloud goes over
one region of Cambridge,

00:59:42.443 --> 00:59:43.600
there's still coverage.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.080
That's a really big question.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.850
And the economics are what's
driving this right now.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.627
These large field
installations give you a sense.

00:59:50.627 --> 00:59:51.710
This is a road right here.

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.168
These little green
specs are trees.

00:59:53.168 --> 00:59:56.620
These are huge field
Installations of solar.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.950
The economics are
driving it right now.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:02.472
But there are opportunities
with commercial buildings.

01:00:02.472 --> 01:00:04.680
This is the Moscone Center
in downtown San Francisco.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.170
It's like the Heinz Convention
Center equivalent there.

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:11.570
This is an example of a
house in Rochester, New York.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:15.680
That housing development in
Rancho Cordova in California.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.890
So you have examples of
residential installations

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:18.890
as well.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.820
Are we just going to let
economics drive this?

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.570
Is there going to be
some policy involved?

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:25.730
Is there a smarter way to
do it, not only from a cost

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.090
perspective, but from a societal
perspective or an energy grid

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.750
robustness point of view?

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.330
What are the right choices here?

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.950
There's a lot of open questions
right now in the field.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.130
And what about energy storage?

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:40.540
Are we going to store it in
terms of batteries and fuel?

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.080
Centralized storage?

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.740
Are we just going dump it into
the grid and be free riders?

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.360
Let the grid handle it, somehow.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.190
Hope that the grid a stable
enough that when a lot of solar

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.450
is being produced and when
no solar is being produced,

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.760
it'll just be able
to accommodate.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.316
I guess the resistance in the
turbines of the fossil fuel

01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:57.940
plants will either
increase or decrease

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.619
depending on how much energy
we're pumping into the grid.

01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:03.160
And so at the end of the day,
we have this very complex space

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.740
of conversion technologies.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.790
The solar electricity,
solar to heat, and so forth.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:11.530
And the system itself, whether
we have centralized generation

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.171
of electricity
distributed generation,

01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:15.420
and whether the storage is
centralized or distributed,

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.980
whether you have storage inside
of our house on the inverter,

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.830
let's say, or in the
basement, or rather

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.750
the storage is some
centralized storage

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.750
facility in the
center of Cambridge

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.130
that serves as a buffer.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.220
And we have all of
this space to play in.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.670
We're going to be focusing
on solar to electricity.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.980
So we'll be focusing on
these two columns right here.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.440
And specifically,
the technologies

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.500
during the first two thirds, and
then, the broader, system level

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.380
impacts in the
third of the course.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.910
So that puts it
all in perspective,

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.590
I'm not going to get
too much into this.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.820
I'm just going to say one
quick word about CO2, energy,

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.850
and climate change.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:56.360
You hear a lot of
talk about, at least

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.330
from the political sector, that
scientists are, shall we say,

01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:04.630
in a lot of debate whether
climate change exists or not.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.720
That is patently false.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.799
The majority of
scientists, upwards of 96%,

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:13.340
believe that there
is strong evidence

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:17.310
to support the fact that human
energy consumption, especially

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.560
the high CO2 intensity of
our energy consumption,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.896
is driving some form
of climate change.

01:02:21.896 --> 01:02:24.270
What the magnitude is and what
the impact is-- obviously,

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.070
that is still under discussion.

01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.580
But the reality
that our emission

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.180
of energy-- our emission of
CO2 as a result of energy

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.140
use, our fossil fuel energy use,
is driving some form of climate

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.850
change that there is widespread
consensus among the established

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:39.240
scientists in the field.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.740
Now if you want to do some back
of the envelope calculations

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:45.040
just to convince yourself
that we, tiny, puny, little

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.690
human beings are having
an impact on our world,

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:48.930
do this for me.

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:51.810
Take the total energy
consumption rate.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.270
This is the energy burn rate.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.550
So it's the average
power-- average

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:58.760
rate of electricity use.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:05.800
Look at just the fossil
fuel based energy sources.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.640
Or if you prefer, take
the average CO2 intensity

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.770
of our energy mix, which
somewhere around 600 or maybe

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.680
800 grams of CO2
per kilowatt hour.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.120
And then look at that
amount of CO2 emitted.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.610
You can calculate how much
CO2 is emitted per unit time

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:28.280
from our energy mix knowing the
carbon intensity of our energy

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.240
mix.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.370
Then do a quick back of
the envelope calculation.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.170
Assume that our atmosphere
is 30 kilometers thick.

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:36.652
It's a generous assumption.

01:03:36.652 --> 01:03:38.860
The density of the atmosphere
dwindles pretty quickly

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.800
above 10 kilometers.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.750
But assume it's 30
kilometers thick.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.070
And then dissolve
all of that carbon

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.070
that we're creating
from this energy mix

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.565
into that thin shell
surrounding our earth.

01:03:48.565 --> 01:03:52.660
Our earth is on the order of
6,370 kilometers in radius.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.884
And it's only 30 kilometers
thick, the atmosphere.

01:03:55.884 --> 01:03:58.300
That's why those beautiful
photos from the space missions,

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.110
when you see that thin
blue shell on the planet,

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.880
right-- that's the atmosphere.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.460
It's really, really thin.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.900
Just do a quick carbon
density analysis.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.100
And you'll see that we're adding
hi tens of parts per million

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.572
of CO2 to the atmosphere.

01:04:14.572 --> 01:04:17.030
And then you look at the total
CO2 in the atmosphere, which

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.240
is in the order of
400 parts per million,

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.940
and you'll see that we're adding
an appreciable amount, just

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.206
given the carbon intensity
of our energy mix

01:04:25.206 --> 01:04:27.330
and the total volume of
atmosphere into which we're

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.270
dumping that carbon.

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.080
And so the question
of whether or not

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.480
we are adding carbon to
the atmosphere, I think,

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.597
is indisputable, based
on some quick back

01:04:35.597 --> 01:04:37.430
of the envelope
calculations and, of course,

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:39.170
the more in-depth models.

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:42.390
The only place where you can
have some wiggle room to argue

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:45.600
is whether or not CO2 actually
influences the climate.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.540
And for that, there
are a number of studies

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.580
discussing that point.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:54.340
I would refer you, specifically,
to these here, published

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.580
in Science in 2005, that
discuss historical correlations

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.660
over the last 600,000
years, correlating CO2

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.110
and mean global temperatures
based on oxygen isotope

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:08.900
ratios containing gas bubbles,
for example, in ice cores.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.510
So I would say if you're
arguing whether or not

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:14.120
we're having an influence
on our atmosphere,

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.560
I would say that is a
difficult position to take.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.409
The only room that I would
give you some room to maneuver

01:05:20.409 --> 01:05:21.950
would be if you
said, well, you know,

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:24.440
CO2 really isn't that
bad in the atmosphere,

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.205
despite what our
infrared absorption data

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.580
seems to indicate,
that it really

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.220
does absorb infrared
light and reemit it.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.800
So that's what I have to
say about the climate, which

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.592
is a huge motivator for a lot
of people taking the course.

01:05:37.592 --> 01:05:39.800
And you're welcome to talk
about that in more detail,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.420
but I'd really love to keep
this focus on the technology,

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.390
by and large.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.590
And for that, I'd like to hand
out these background assessment

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:48.550
quizzes for each of you.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:52.160
Please take a few moments to
fill these out-- just pass them

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.130
back-- so we can learn
more about your interests.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.110
And what I'll also
do is pass around

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.140
this little solar
module, right here,

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.470
so you can get a sense of what
a small little solar cell looks

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:04.760
like up close and personal.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.890
Once you're done, feel
free to come up and take

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.205
a look at the solar module,
right here, as well.

01:06:09.205 --> 01:06:11.040
And thanks.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.420
PROFESSOR: In the last
lecture, we began the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.360
discussion of modulation.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.930
And in particular, what
we focused on, was the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.710
continuous time case.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.420
And in talking about continuous
time modulation,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.950
we've covered a number
of topics.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.330
We talked about the properties
and analysis of modulation

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.160
when we had a complex
exponential carrier signal.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.960
We talked about the properties
and analysis in the case of a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.130
sinusoidal carrier.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.180
And in that context and related
to the application

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.900
associated with communications,
we talked

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.660
about synchronous modulation,
asynchronous modulation and

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.360
also the notion of single
side band modulation.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.960
In the lecture today, there are
two issues that I'd like

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.920
to address, broad topics.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.270
One is a parallel discussion,
particularly, as associated

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.940
with complex exponential and
sinusoidal modulation for

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.260
discrete time signals.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.940
And the second is the
introduction and analysis of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.710
another kind of carriers,
specifically a pulse kind of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.680
carrier in continuous time
leading to the notions of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.150
pulse amplitude modulation
and, eventually, a very

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.990
powerful theorem and result
called the sampling theorem.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.100
Well, let me begin the lecture,
though, focusing on

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.380
the discrete time modulation
to essentially draw your

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
attention to the fact that the
analysis in discrete time very

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.200
much parallels the analysis
in continuous time.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.330
Well, let's consider, in the
discrete time case, just as we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.810
had in continuous time, a signal
modulating a carrier

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.170
signal and the resulting
modulated signal is y of n.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.510
And it was in continuous time
the modulation property

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.460
associated with the Fourier
Transform that provided the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.340
basis for the analysis.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.610
And exactly the same thing
is true in the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.120
discrete time case.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200
In particular, what we have
in discrete time, is the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.050
modulation property as it
relates to the Fourier

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.820
Transform, which tells us that
the Fourier Transform of the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.080
modulated signal is the
convolution of the Fourier

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.840
Transform of the carrier and the
Fourier Transform of the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.460
modulated signal.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.070
And the only real difference at
issue here is that, in the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.590
discrete time case, what we're
talking about is a periodic

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.970
convolution because
the specter,

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490
of course is periodic.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.080
Whereas, in the continuous time
case, it was an aperiodic

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.010
convolution.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.860
So let's parallel the
discussion, and in particular,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.300
what we'll focus on is, first,
a complex exponential carrier

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.820
and second a sinusoidal
carrier.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.470
And we'll see how this parallels
our discussion in

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.029
continuous time, and we'll make
fairly brief reference as

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.350
we introduce the pulse carrier
for continuous time.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.900
We'll make very brief reference
to the pulse carrier

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.790
for discrete time indicating
that, again, the analysis and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.280
discrete time and continuous
time is very parallel.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.990
So let's, first, consider
complex exponential and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
sinusoidal carriers for the
discrete time case,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.960
emphasizing the very strong
parallel and similarity

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.170
between discrete time
and continuous time.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.740
Well we have, once, again
the modulation property.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.000
And the modulation property
tells us that the spectrum of

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.280
the modulated signal is the
periodic convolution of the

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120
two spectra.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.200
And let's consider, for
example, an input, or

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.480
modulating spectrum, as
I've indicated here.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.530
And since we want to consider,
first of all, a complex

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.670
exponential carrier, we'll
consider the case of c of n

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.940
equal to e to the
j omega sub cn.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.040
And let me stress, by the way,
as I did in the continuous

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.510
time case, that I'll tend to
suppress the phase angle

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.260
which, of course, can
be associated

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.610
with the carrier also.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.260
All right, so we have,
then, the spectrum of

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.320
the modulated signal.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.130
The spectra, the carrier
signal, if this is the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.160
carrier, then it's spectrum is
an impulse train, and that

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.690
impulse train, I've
indicated here.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.110
And let me stress, also, that in
the discrete time case, of

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.820
course, these spectra and all
of the spectra involved, are

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.500
periodic with a period
of 2 pi.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.000
So this then is the spectrum
of the carrier signal.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.440
This is the spectrum of
the input signal.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.730
The periodic convolution of
these two is the spectrum the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.360
modulated signal.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.940
And the result is, then, this
spectrum shifted to a center

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.170
frequency, which is the carrier
frequency omega sub c.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.120
So the result of modulation with
a complex exponential is

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.940
a straightforward shift of the
spectrum so that what occurred

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.820
around zero frequency now occurs
around the frequency

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.040
omega sub c.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.670
Now, in the continuous time
case, we demodulated, when we

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.600
had a complex exponential
carrier, we demodulated by,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.930
essentially, just shifting
the spectrum back.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.950
And in fact, in the discrete
time case, were able to do

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.180
exactly the same thing.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:11.660
So if we were to replace c of n
which is either j omega sub

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.490
cn by c of n equals e to the
minus j omega sub cn, the

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.920
resulting spectra would be an
impulse train, as I indicate

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:32.340
here, and the result of multiply
y of n by that new

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.240
carrier, in the frequency domain
as a convolution of

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.300
these two, and it's relatively
straightforward to verify that

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.160
if you convolve these with a
periodic convolution, then

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.300
that will get us back to the
original spectrum that we

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.460
started with.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.270
So what's happened in the
discrete time case, with the

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.970
complex exponential, is
exactly the same as in

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.420
continuous time.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.040
Namely, we modulate that
corresponds to

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.470
shifting the spectrum.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.960
We demodulate by multiplying
by the complex conjugate of

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.710
the original modulated carrier
and that shifts the spectrum

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.290
back to where it
was originally.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:14.760
OK.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.540
Now let's consider the case
of a sinusoidal carrier in

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.910
discrete time.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.390
And again, things very much
parallel what we saw in

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.190
continuous time.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.460
And again, as we look at the
spectra, I will choose a phase

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.770
angle of zero, mainly for
notational and analytical

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.460
convenience.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.190
So in this case, now, rather
than a carrier signal, which

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.740
is a single complex exponential,
it's now a

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.470
sinusoidal carrier and the
sinusoidal carrier is the sum

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.320
of two complex exponential.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.960
And so if we consider a
modulated spectrum, that is

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.510
the spectrum of x of n,
something of the type that I

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:09.430
indicate here, and the spectrum
of the carrier, now,

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.460
since the carrier is sinusoidal
rather than a

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.750
complex exponential consists of
two impulses, one at plus

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:22.070
omega sub c and one at minus
omega sub c, convolving this

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.440
spectrum with this spectrum
gives us a replication of x of

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.450
omega around plus and
minus omega sub c.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.800
And incidentally, with an
amplitude change of a half.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.540
So again, things have
worked as they did

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.640
in continuous time.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.690
In continuous time or in
discrete time, modulating with

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.590
a sinusoidal carrier would
correspond to a replication of

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.800
the spectrum around, plus the
carrier frequency and a

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.450
replication of the spectrum
around minus the carrier

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:05.350
frequency, in both cases, as
long as the carrier frequency

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.060
is large enough compared with
the bandwidth of the signal so

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.920
that those two replication
don't overlap, then it's

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.850
reasonable to suppose that we
should be able to recover the

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.330
original signal.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:25.470
Well, in fact, to demodulate in
the discrete time case, we

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.170
would again follow very much
the strategy that we did in

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.080
continuous time.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.180
In particular, let's consider
demodulating by taking the

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.040
modulated signal and, again,
putting that through a

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.220
modulator, again, with
the carrier which is

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.690
cosine omega sub cn.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.700
If we do that, we have a
demodulator or what will turn

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.010
out to be part of a demodulator,
as I indicate

00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:00.320
here, the spectrum of the input
signal is, as I had just

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.040
developed, a replication of the
original spectrum around

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.760
plus and minus omega sub c with
an amplitude of a half.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.410
When this is, again, convolved
with the spectrum of the

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.860
carrier, then we get a
replication of the original

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:25.650
spectrum, first around zero
frequency, as I indicate here,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.680
and then around twice the
carrier frequency and minus

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.010
twice the carrier frequency.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.030
And as long as the carrier
frequency is large enough

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:42.610
compared with the width of the
original signal, then, as you

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:48.360
can see, by extracting this part
of the spectrum with a

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.780
low pass filter, we can, in
principle, recover the

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.810
spectrum associated with
the original signal.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.060
And again, just as in continuous
time, because this

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.860
amplitude is a half, we would
want to choose, for scaling

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.850
purposes, a low pass filter
amplitude which is 2 to

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.630
compensate for this
factor of a half.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.400
So once again things work out
basically the same way as they

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.350
had in continuous time.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:26.250
We have sinusoidal modulation
which consists of using a

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.010
sinusoidal carrier.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:33.100
And we have the demodulator
which consists of taking a

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.260
modulated signal, multiplying
by the carrier, and then

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:44.650
processing that with a low pass
filter to extract the

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.070
portion of the spectrum, which
is around zero frequency, as I

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:55.220
indicate in the spectrum below
and the result, then, that

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.730
this low pass filter having
a gain of 2 is that we've

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:06.020
recovered the original spectrum,
x of omega, which is

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.390
the spectrum that
we started with.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.060
Now several other things
to stress.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.310
This is a fairly quick tour
through sinusoidal modulation

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.000
for discrete time.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.720
There are very similar issues
that arise in the discrete

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.040
time case in terms of having
phase synchronization and

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.820
frequency synchronization
between the modulator and

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.110
demodulator.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.120
And we had discussed that in a
fair amount of detail for the

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.900
continuous time case.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.680
In some sense, in practical
terms, that becomes much more

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.860
of an issue in continuous time
than it does in discrete time,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.550
in part, because synchronization
between a

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.050
modulator and demodulator is
often much harder in a

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.570
continuous time system, which
is essentially an analog

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.490
system as compared with
a digital system.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.520
Another very important reason
and it's important to stress

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.550
this at the outset is that,
whereas the theory involving

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.750
the use of complex exponential
and sinusoidal modulation

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.480
parallels very strongly in the
continuous time and the

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.240
discrete time case.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.350
In practical terms, it has
much more significance in

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.810
continuous time than it
does in discrete time.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.140
That is, the notion called
sinusidal modulation, in the

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.410
context of communication
systems, is extremely

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.740
important for continuous time
systems, and less so in

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.720
discrete time systems.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.690
Now as a preview of a point to
be raised later on, I should

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.040
modify that slightly with the
statement that one very

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.700
important place in which
sinusoidal modulation in a

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.420
discrete time context arises,
is in a class of systems

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.410
called transmultiplexers or
transmodulation systems.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.190
And this surface is basically
because so many communication

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:16.080
systems are now becoming digital
and, specifically,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.400
discrete time, although the
actual transmission is

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.510
continuous time, the signal
processing manipulation and

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.080
switching is discrete time.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.510
And so, in fact, it turns out
to be very important and

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:35.200
useful to take a discrete time
representation of the analog

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.010
signals or continuous time
signals and, in a discrete

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.380
time, or digital representation,
to convert

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.240
them from one modulation scheme
or one multiplexing

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.070
scheme to another.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:53.280
And although I said a lot there
that really requires

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:00.900
much more detail to develop in
any sense at all, you should

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.530
get the notion that discrete
time modulation systems become

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.560
very important, in
part, because of

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.110
implementational issues.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.720
OK, now, there is another
application that we have

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.820
discussed for both continuous
time and actually, previously,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.510
for discrete time, amplitude
modulation with sinusoidal

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.630
complex exponential carriers.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.800
And let me just remind you of
that, because, in fact, it

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.930
becomes a very important
one in the case of

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.980
discrete time systems.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.360
And that is the notion of using
modulation together with

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.170
fixed filtering to implement a
filter, which either has a

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.940
variable cut off or converts,
let's say, a low pass filter

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.580
to a high pass filter.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.240
We had originally talked about
this when we introduce the

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.260
modulation property in the
context of converting a low

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.579
pass filter to a high
pass filter.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:12.180
And the notion was that, if we
modulate the signal with a

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.520
carrier which is minus 1 to the
n, and that's just simply

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.540
a complex exponential or
sinusoidal carrier with a

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.240
carrier frequency of pi, then
that, in effect, interchanges

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.000
the low frequencies and
the high frequencies.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.450
And if, after modulation, that
is processed with a low pass

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:42.150
filter, and then the result is
demodulated, using exactly the

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:47.840
same carrier, namely a carrier
which is minus 1 to the n,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.900
then the effect of that is
equivalent to high pass

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.170
filtering on the original
signal.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:00.210
And a generalization of that
would involve, instead of this

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.530
specific choice of minus 1 to
the n, would involve a choice,

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.830
in general, of e to the j omega
sub cn, that is a more

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:14.000
general carrier frequency, and
a demodulator which is e to

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.590
the minus j omega sub cn.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.360
And as I've represented it here,
and as we had talked

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.780
about it when we talked about
the modulation property for

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.020
discrete time signals, we had
specifically chosen the

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.060
conversion of a low pass
to a high pass filter.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.530
Well, let me continue the
review of that just by

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.090
reminding you of the details
of what happens with the

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:43.390
spectra, and, specifically, the
notion, if we take this

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.200
particular case of omega sub
c is equal to pi, or

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.950
equivalently, a carrier signal
which is minus 1 to the n,

00:18:51.950 --> 00:19:01.090
then if we have the original
spectra and the spectrum of

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.100
the carrier signal, the spectrum
of the carrier signal

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.690
convolved with this spectrum
will then, in effect, shift

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.900
this by pi.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.410
And so, after modulating, the
result that we have is a shift

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.260
of that spectrum so that what
happened in low frequencies

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.740
now happens at high frequencies,
namely around pi,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.280
and what happened at high
frequencies now happens at low

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.900
frequencies.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.480
Well, if that's processed now,
with a low pass filter, and

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.690
this dashed line indicates the
low pass filter, then the

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.090
result that we get is shown
here, where we've extracted

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.630
the low frequency portion
of the modulated signal.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:56.990
And now when we modulate or
demodulate back, then this

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.640
spectrum is shifted back
to where it belongs.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.580
Namely, it's shifted back to
be centered around minus pi

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.780
and around plus pi.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.660
So if we just compare this
spectrum with the original

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.240
spectrum at the top, what we
can see is that, in effect,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.690
what we've done is to extract
a portion of the spectrum

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.380
equivalent to processing with
a high pass filter.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.350
And, again, this is very similar
to what we did in

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.090
continuous time and all of the
analytical processes and

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.180
convolution involved are
very much the same.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.610
Really, the biggest difference
between continuous time

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.520
discrete time has to do, not
so much with the details of

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.670
the analysis, but perhaps has
more to do with issues of

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.920
practical applications.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:05.020
OK, well, so what we've done,
so far, for continuous time

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.250
and discrete time, is to talk
about modulation, amplitude

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.730
modulation with complex
exponential

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.540
and sinusoidal carriers.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.010
We saw that the analysis is
very similar, although

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.190
applications are slightly
different.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.480
And now what I'd like to turn
to is a different choice of

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.650
carrier signal.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.400
And the carrier signal, in this
particular case, is a

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.450
pulse train rather than
a sinusoidal signal.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:42.930
Now the idea is the following.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.700
In general, of course, the
modulator consists of all of

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.490
multiplying x of t by whatever
the carrier signal is.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.960
And previously, we've talked
about a carrier signal which

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.435
is sinusoidal signal.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:00.740
The carrier signal that we
want to consider now is a

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.860
carrier signal which, in
fact, is a pulse train.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.530
And so, in fact, what we want
to do is multiply the input

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:17.160
signal by a pulse train and, in
effect, then, the modulated

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.070
signal consists of the original
signal, simply with

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.250
time slices pulled out of it,
as I've indicated in the

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.030
bottom curve.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:33.930
So what we have now is a
modulated signal that is a

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:40.880
chopped or sliced version of the
original waveform and that

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.610
is what's referred to as pulse
amplitude modulation.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.430
Now it seems like it's
kind of a crazy idea.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:55.000
The idea is to chop out slices
of the wave form and hope that

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.680
you could put things back
together again.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.480
And the amazing thing about it,
as we'll see, is that, in

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.140
fact, under fairly broad
general and applicable

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.800
conditions, you really can put
the waveform back together

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.720
again if you just have
these time slices.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.350
Not only that, but that basic
notion, as we'll see, is

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.820
independent, in fact,
of what the width of

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.370
those time slices are.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.900
In fact the width
can go to zero.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.530
And, in fact, we're going to
make it go to zero, and really

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.920
only dependent on what
the frequency of

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.700
the pulse train is.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.950
So let's explore that
in some detail.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:45.010
And what we want to look at is
the analysis, but let me,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.680
first, just comment, very
briefly, that all of the

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.520
analysis we go through, as has
been true in the case of

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.140
sinusoidal modulation, all of
the analysis then we go

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.660
through holds just as well
with, essentially minor

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.510
analytical modifications, to
discrete time pulse amplitude

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.190
modulation as it does to
continuous time pulse

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.920
amplitude modulation.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.390
And so we'll really only go
through this in terms of

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.900
tracking the wave forms
and spectra for the

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.320
continuous time case.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.370
But bear in mind that the
results are basically similar

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.940
for discrete time.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.350
OK, well, let's see how so we
get the basic result that we

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.110
want to get.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:38.860
What we have is modulated signal
which is a pulse train,

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.620
basically a square wave, and
as we've seen in previous

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.870
lectures, the spectra or Fourier
transform associated

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.420
with that is an impulse train.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.840
And the envelope of that impulse
train is on the form

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.430
of a sine x over x function.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.220
The Fourier transform
is impulses.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:05.970
And the spacing of the impulses
is associated with

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.470
the fundamental frequency of
the pulse train and that's

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.790
omega sub p.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.630
So omega sub p is pi divided
by the period

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.570
of the pulse train.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:23.350
And the amplitude and shape of
this envelope is dictated by

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.570
the parameter delta, which
has to do with how

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.340
wide the pulses are.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.100
OK, so we have a
time function.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.750
It's multiplied by
this pulse train.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.780
Now we're talking
continuous time.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.800
So, in the frequency domain, we
have the Fourier transform

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.350
of the time function convolved
with this Fourier transform

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.720
for the pulse train.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.550
And let's see what
that looks like.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.830
If we were to consider, let's
say, a Fourier transform,

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.910
which I have chosen as more or
less a general one, then in

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:03.370
fact, when we convert all of
this with this impulse train,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:11.240
what we end up with is a
replication of this spectrum

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.700
at the places in the frequency
domain where the individual

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.260
impulses occurred.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.200
So we can see that this spectrum
is replicated at each

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.530
of these locations.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:33.220
And as long as the frequency
of the pulse train is large

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.410
enough, compared with the
maximum frequency in the

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.750
original signal, x of t, so
that there's no overlap

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.570
between these triangles, then
what you can see, in fact,

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:52.130
somewhat amazingly is that,
simply by low pass filtering

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:57.100
the result, we can get back,
except for amplitude factor,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.490
we can get back to the
original signal.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.870
Now it's amazing.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:08.470
It really is amazing that all
that this depends on is the

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.530
original signal being band
limited and the frequency of

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.870
the pulse train being high
enough so that when you

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.700
replicate the spectrum the
frequency domain, there's no

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.480
overlap between these individual
replications.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.360
And we'll have address that a
little more in a few minutes.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.550
But let me, first of all, point
out that this has a

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.300
whole variety of very important
implications.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.350
One is, in the context of
communications, it leads to

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.290
another very important
multiplexing scheme for

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.510
communications.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.530
We had talked last time about
frequency division

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.010
multiplexing, where individual
signals were put into

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.250
individual frequencies slots by
choosing different carrier

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.790
frequencies for a sinusoidal
modulating signal.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:05.400
What this suggests is that
what we can put different

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:12.050
signals into, non-overlapping
time slots and, in fact, be

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.960
able to recover the original
signals back again.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.460
So in particular, suppose that
I had a signal which I

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:25.070
modulated with a pulse train
and I chose another signal,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.660
modulated with another pulse
train, where the time slot was

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.470
different, and I continued
this process.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:37.330
And after I'd done this with
some number of channels,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:43.910
simply added all those together
as I indicate here.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.220
Then as long as I knew what time
slots to associate with

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.370
what signal, I could get the
original modulated signals

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.920
back again.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.590
And then as long as the
frequency of the impulse train

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:05.400
was such that I was able to do
this reconstruction by simply

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.100
low pass filtering, then I would
be able to demodulate.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.770
So it's a very different very
important modulation scheme

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.890
called time division
multiplexing in contrast to

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.060
frequency division multiplexing
as we had talked

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.740
about last time.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.750
I had made reference earlier
to the concept of

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.570
trans-multiplexing.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.760
And in fact, what happens in
many communication systems is

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.530
that the signals are
represented, in fact, in

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.760
discrete time.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.380
The analog and continuous time
signals are represented in

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.750
discrete time.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.330
And very often the conversion
from frequency division

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.970
multiplexing to time division
multiplexing and back is done,

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.160
in fact, in the discrete
time domain.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:30:01.800
OK, so what we have then, is
the notion that we can

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:08.670
multiply a time function
by a pulse train,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.940
as I indicate here.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:17.020
And from the output I can, if
the frequency of this pulse

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.770
train is high enough in relation
to this bandwidth,

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:25.640
from the output, which consists
of time slices, from

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.450
those time slices I can recover
the original signal.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:37.770
Stressing again the reason it
relates to the spectra, and

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.760
the reason is that the original
spectra is simply

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.170
replicated at multiples of the
fundamental frequency of the

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.420
pulse train.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.320
Now there's a very important
thing to observe here, which

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.620
is that the ability to do the
reconstruction is associated

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.690
with the notion of whether
we can extract

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.360
that central triangle.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.030
I happened to choose a
triangular shape but obviously

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.260
I could be talking about any
shape, as long as it's band

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.230
limited, the ability
to extract that.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:19.270
And notice that, in this
modulated output spectrum, the

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.800
ability to recover this is
totally independent called

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.880
what the value of delta is.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:35.520
In other words, if we look back
at the modulator, then,

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.360
in fact, we can make delta,
the width of these pulses,

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.470
arbitrarily small.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.710
And, in theory, that doesn't
affect our ability to do the

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.150
reconstruction.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.590
Now in practical
terms it might.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.360
Looking back once more at the
spectrum of the output, notice

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.060
that this amplitude is
proportional to delta.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.470
And what that suggests is that,
as we make delta smaller

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.320
and smaller, which we might,
in fact, want to do, if you

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.370
want to time division multiplex
lots of channels, in

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.210
principle, in theory, you could
make it an infinite

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.680
number of channels just
by making that

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.780
infinitesimally small.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.030
The smaller it is, in
some sense, the less

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.140
energy there is.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.340
And again, in practical terms,
this one of those things if

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.310
you push down here pops up
there, namely, you eventually

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.480
run into issues such
as noise problems.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.510
So, more typically what's done
is to, in fact, eliminate this

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.540
scale factor of delta.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.570
And the way that that's
done is very simply.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:51.600
It's done by choosing the width
of the pulses, and the

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.240
height of the pulses, in such
a way that the area is

00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:01.890
constant, even as we make delta
get arbitrarily small.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.820
So we can just modify our
argument so that what we're

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.890
referring to is a modulated
pulse train, which is a pulse

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.360
train with pulses of
width delta and

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.900
height, 1 over delta.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:24.160
In that case, as delta gets
arbitrarily small, then, in

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.570
fact, what these rectangles
become are impulses, in which

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:36.290
case, what we're talking about
is a carrier signal which, in

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.550
fact, is an impulse train.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:45.200
And the resulting modulated
signal is an impulse train for

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.630
which the amplitudes of the
impulses are proportional to

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:56.290
the original input waveform at
the times at which these

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.050
impulses occur.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:03.510
OK well, let's look at
the analysis of that.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:15.010
And so now, what we're talking
about, is a spectrum that

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:20.840
consists of the result of the
spectrum we talked about

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.900
before with the sine x over x
envelope, except that, now, as

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.260
delta goes to zero that
becomes flat.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.000
In other words, the modulated
signal is an impulse train.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.210
And so as we look at the
spectrum of the modulated

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.460
signal, that is, then,
an impulse train in

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.380
the frequency domain.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.389
The height is proportional to
the frequency of the impulse

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.659
train and omega sub s now
denotes the frequency of the

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.170
impulse train.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:59.090
And the resulting output of the
modulator has a spectrum

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:04.060
which is this original spectrum,
again, replicated

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.800
around each of these impulses,
in other words, replicated in

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.410
multiples of the sampling
frequency

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.410
Now this is very much
identical to the

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.460
more general case.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.130
We have this replication
of the spectra.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:30.220
And as long as the frequency of
the impulse train is large

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.840
enough, compared with the
bandwidth of the signal so

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.670
that these triangles don't
overlap, I can extract this

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:45.070
portion of the spectrum by low
pass filtering, in fact, would

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.340
then give us back the
original signal.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:54.380
Now if, instead, this frequency
omega sub m is

00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:00.060
greater than omega sub s minus
omega sub m, we would have a

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.140
spectrum that looked something
more like this.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.640
And what's happened, in this
case, is that, because we have

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.980
an overlap here, we've destroyed
the ability to

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.430
recover the original signal
from the impulse train.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.750
And that would be true, also
in a more general case, of

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:26.820
pulse amplitude modulation with
pulses of non-zero width.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:32.520
This effect by the way, is one
that we'll be exploring in

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.100
considerably more detail
in the next lecture.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.440
And it's a phenomenon or
distortion refer to as

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.540
aliasing which, in fact,
is an important

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.090
and interesting topic.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.620
But going back to the case
in which we've chosen the

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:50.070
frequency of the impulse train
high enough, then we would

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:57.300
recover the original signal by
processing it through a low

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.050
pass filter.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:06.480
And in that case, what this
says is, that if we have a

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:13.030
signal, and we modulate it with
an impulse train, if we

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.960
then process that impulse train
through an idea low pass

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.950
filter, given the right
conditions on the frequency of

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.760
impulse train and the bandwidth
of the signal, we

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.050
can recover the original
signal back again.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:32.770
Now let me stress, just going
back to the picture in which

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:37.560
we had done this modulation,
that this process, where the

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.880
modulation, where the carrier
signal involves an impulse

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.380
train, is often referred
to as sampling.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:50.290
And what that means,
specifically, is that, if we

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:58.510
notice, this resulting impulse
train is, in fact, a sequence

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:04.190
of samples of the original
continuous time signal.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.930
In other words, what we've
done, in effect, is taken

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.940
instantaneous sample
of this wave form.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.560
And the implication is that,
if we do that at a rapid

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:21.190
enough rate in relation to the
bandwidth of the signal, then

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.280
we can, in fact, recover the
original signal back again.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:31.960
And, finally to remind you of
the argument once more, we

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.910
have an original signal and
we have its spectrum.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.800
When we've sampled it, and
this is now the sampled

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.400
signal, it's an impulse train
whose instantaneous values are

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.840
samples of the original
waveform, the spectrum of that

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.890
is the original one
replicated.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:59.110
And when that is processed,
through a low pass filter, to

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:03.500
extract this part of the
spectrum, then, after the low

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.530
pass filter, we can recover the

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.910
original signal back again.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:18.650
OK well, in fact, although if
you follow through the spectra

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.610
and the wave forms, this all
seems fairly straightforward

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:29.210
and, perhaps or perhaps not,
obvious, it's really worth

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:34.510
reflecting on how amazing
the result really is.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:39.040
We began this discussion by
talking about modulation.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.030
And in fact modulation and
sinusoidal of modulation is

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.410
important in its own right.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:49.890
We ended the discussion by
talking about first pulse

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:55.210
amplitude modulation, and then
showing how, under the right

00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:01.320
set of conditions, you can, in
fact, take a wave form and

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.520
sample it with a set of
instantaneous samples.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.820
And that set of instantaneous
samples, in fact, are

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.690
sufficient to totally
represent and

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.280
reconstruct the signal.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.070
What in fact, the formal
statement that is, is refer to

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:24.030
as the sampling theorem, a very
powerful theorem that

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:28.190
says, if we're given equally
spaced samples of a time

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:36.950
function, and if that time
function is band limited, and

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:45.110
if the bandwidth and if the
sampling frequency is chosen

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:54.100
in the right way, in relation
to the bandwidth, then, in

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.990
fact, the original time
function is uniquely

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.320
recoverable with a
low pass filter.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:11.110
Now the sampling theorem is,
I would say, a watershed or

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.520
cornerstone of a lot of the
discussion that we've been

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.450
having for a whole variety
of reasons.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.620
It, first of all, drops out
almost as a straightforward

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.920
obvious statement.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.700
But more importantly what
it says is, if I have a

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.160
continuous time signal which
satisfies the right set of

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:38.300
conditions, I could represent it
by what it does at sampling

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.200
instance or, equivalently, at
discrete instance of time.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:49.920
Now what that leads to is
a whole host of things.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.630
One of which is this statement
that says, if we have a

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:58.880
continuous time signal, I could
in fact, represent it as

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.090
a discrete time signal.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.890
And I could even think of
processing a continuous time

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.520
signal using discrete
time concepts.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.010
And when I'm all done converting
back, through the

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.230
power of the sampling theorem,
converting back to a

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.870
continuous time signal.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:21.790
So the sampling theorem provides
us with a very major

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:25.240
important bridge between
continuous time and discrete

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.930
time implementations
and ideas.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.950
In the next several lectures,
we will be exploring some of

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.140
this in considerable detail.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.860
First, to focus in more, next
time, on some of the specific

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.620
issues and distortions
associated with sampling.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.520
And following that, a discussion
of what is referred

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.400
to discrete time processing of
continuous time signals.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.650
Thank you.

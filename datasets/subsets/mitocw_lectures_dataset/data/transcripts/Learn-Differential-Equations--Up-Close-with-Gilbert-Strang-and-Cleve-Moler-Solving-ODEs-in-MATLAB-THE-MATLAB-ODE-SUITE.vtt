00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:07.000
PROFESSOR: We can get to
documentation for the MATLAB

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.480
ODE Suite by entering
this command at the MATLAB

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.290
prompt-- doc ode45.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.240
This will bring us to an
extensive documentation

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.490
for MATLAB ode45 that
includes among other things

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.050
this chart that compares
MATLAB ODE solvers.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540
There are seven of
them and this compares

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.645
their various attributes.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.550
As we've said before, MATLAB
ode45 is the workhorse.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.910
It's a nonstiff solver
with medium accuracy

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.620
that is the first
one you should try,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.530
and we use it most of the time.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.540
I have a soft heart in my
heart for MATLAB ode23.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.320
It's a nonstiff solver
with low accuracy,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.370
but its accuracy
that's appropriate

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.320
for graphics work because
the step size it chooses

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.900
is appropriate for
most graphics work.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.530
MATLAB ode113 we haven't
talked about it yet,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.110
there could be a comma
between the 1 and the 13

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.970
here because this
is a variable order

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.170
method where the order varies
all the way from 1 to 13.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.290
It's a multi-step method
that saves history.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.845
If, you know about these things,
it's an Adams-Moulton method.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.690
I associate this with worked
done at Jet Propulsion

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.290
Laboratory years ago for
computing orbits of planets

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.259
and satellites, which of
course are very smooth

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.870
and go on for years.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.410
It can have very high
accuracy requirements.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.985
Then there are
the stiff solvers.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.920
There are four of them--
15s, 23s, and the twins,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.465
the trapezoid rules.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.750
15s is the primary stiff
solver, low to medium accuracy.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.320
If you find ode45
is slow, taking

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.250
lots of steps-- indication that
the problem is stiff-- try 15s.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.050
23s can be as a low order
method, low accuracy,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.000
and used at crude
error tolerances.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.300
We haven't talked
about mass matrices.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.350
This is where there's
a matrix in front

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.730
of the derivative term, and this
can be used with constant mass

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.320
matrices.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.490
And then the two routines
with T's in their name

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.570
are based on the
trapezoidal rule,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.330
and they're for
use with problems

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.880
without any numerical damping.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.870
You can see the documentation
for more details

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.700
on the trapezoid methods.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.370
That's the MATLAB ODE
Suite seven solvers,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.830
three for nonstiff problems
and four for stiff problems.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.800
You may well get through
with never using anything

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.175
but ode45 may well
serve all your needs.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.190
There's a second chart
in the documentation that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.130
summarizes all the options that
are available through the ODE

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.710
Set function.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.370
We've briefly mentioned the
tolerances, RelTol and AbsTol--

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.290
the output function-- these
are available in all seven

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.090
of the solvers.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.050
There are various
other functions--

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.900
various other options--
available for more

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.950
specialized work,
including event handling,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.620
providing a Jacobian
to the stiff solvers

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.410
so they don't have
to work so hard

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.250
taking numerical
differences, options

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.460
associated with
the mass matrices,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.430
providing a limit
on the step size.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.460
These are all our
options that can

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.570
be specified through ode Set
for more specialized work

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.550
with the ODE solvers.

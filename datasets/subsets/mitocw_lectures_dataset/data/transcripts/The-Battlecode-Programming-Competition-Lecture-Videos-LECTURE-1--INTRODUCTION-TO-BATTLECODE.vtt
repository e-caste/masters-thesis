00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.556
PROFESSOR: Are you guys
excited about Battlecode?

00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm so excited to
see this many-- Yeah!

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.245
Yeah, let's hear a
hurray-- no, no a yeah.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:39.370
Are you excited?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.350
PROFESSOR: All right,
that was a strong yeah.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.590
I actually mean that.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.716
I have a strange thing
where when I say something

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:52.389
it often comes out like I meant
the opposite of what I said,

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:53.430
like I didn't believe it.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.420
Like that time that Drew
Houston-- from Dropbox,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.610
he's the Dropbox CEO-- do
you guys remember this?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.390
He was giving his sponsor talk
at the finals of Battlecode

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.952
last year and he was
just wrapping up,

00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:09.410
and everybody was
applauding, and I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.740
came to the podium I was
like, thanks, thanks Drew.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.110
That was really good.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.640
That made me want
to work at Dropbox.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.340
If I didn't have a
job already I would.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.840
And nobody believed
me, they thought

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.930
I was just being facetious.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.924
So, now he hates me.

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:29.390
That's too bad.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.640
That happens to me.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.790
OK, let's get started soon.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.710
So you're all here
because you're

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.600
interested in Battlecode.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000
These lectures are optional.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.820
They're geared at beginner
to mid-level coders,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.950
but they'll be
relevant even if you've

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.930
had coding experience
in a million languages.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.490
Because we're
going to be talking

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.000
a lot of the time about
Battlecode, the game itself.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.380
And it could just be a
way to keep yourself up

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.260
to date on the latest
metagame, for example.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.870
So we're going to go
over the specs today.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.150
I'm going to introduce
the competition.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.979
And then after
lecture today, we'll

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.934
be having a lab, during
which we'll help you set up.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.100
So I see a lot of you brought
your computers, that's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.500
fantastic.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.300
And that's also great because
it means if you get bored,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.050
you can just watch
YouTube videos.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.800
Yeah, so make sure to bring
your ear plugs so that you don't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.060
bother the guy next to
you, because he's already

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.080
heard Gangnam Style.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.120
All right so be
respectful of those guys.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520
So here's our introduction.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:46.390
My name is Maxwell Mann, I'll
be your lecturer for the next 10

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.390
days.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.570
It actually is minus 4 days
because of various things.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.670
So it's like the
next two weeks, you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.510
can come here at this
time-- or slightly earlier,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.600
so you can hear a lousy
joke --you can come here,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.050
and you can hear me
talk about the game,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.340
and hear what the
devs think about what

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.840
you might need to know.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.190
And then you can eat
food at 6:00 PM, when

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.650
we have massive
quantities of food coming,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.040
and then from 6:00 to
7:00, you have the option

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.150
of staying for the lab session,
which has been described,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.120
in anticipation,
as a social utopia.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.800
And I really believe
that it could be one,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.520
because everybody here has,
sort of, some similar interests.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.300
So to introduce
us, we developers,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.300
are students, or
alums, who have worked

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.650
on developing Battlecode.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm Max.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.010
Sitting here in the
front is Aaron Epstein

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.930
and Steven Valdez.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.440
You'll be using them for help,
all the time, if you need it,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.950
or just to bother them
because you feel like it.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.840
They're here for
no other reason,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.850
and to maintain the code base
and these kinds of things.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.200
The website is battlecode.org
and we have a forum there,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.030
where you could
also go to get help.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.230
And I also,
particularly, would like

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.840
to direct your attention
to the IRC channel.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.280
It's #battlecode on Freenode.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.930
So I don't know if
you know what that is,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.200
but it's basically
a way that you

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.620
can talk to us on
a real time chat.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.100
So you can do that at pretty
much any hour of the day,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.690
because the way
we're setting it up

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.807
this year is we'll all
be available, pretty

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:33.640
much the whole time.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.750
OK, make sure that if
you are an MIT student,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.250
and you want credit
for this class--

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.920
it's a six credit
class --you just

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.780
have to sign up on
WebSIS for 6.S187.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.170
How many people have signed
up on WebSIS already?

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.050
All right, that's
like everybody.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.260
Let's talk about the
goals of the competition.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.690
What is a game?

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.690
What are we doing?

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.280
I'm sure a lot of you are
thinking all right, well, here

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.840
we go.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.330
I've got finals
tomorrow but I have

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.510
to decide what IAP
classes to take.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.106
Gosh, this is a terrible
combination of deadlines.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.480
Then you thought,
should I take--

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.390
should I to do battle code?

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.170
Should I do one of these other
things, like web programming,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.080
or game programming?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.190
What is the operating
systems whatshumadoosits?

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.410
Should I do this or that?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.150
And you're probably thinking
to yourself, what is fun?

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.230
What is valuable for me?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.630
What am I going to learn?

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.600
And we ask ourselves
the same question.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.890
A couple months
before then was, what

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.470
do we want the Battlecode
competition to be like?

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.860
And what we ended
up deciding, was

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.480
that the game needs
to be fun and it

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.290
needs to contain classic
battle code areas of challenge

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.570
in artificial intelligence.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.130
So this is a game that
is a cross-- we've always

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.880
said in the past that
it is not StarCraft

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.870
--but it is a cross between
a real-time strategy

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.000
game and an AI
programming competition.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.250
So what we wanted was the
game to be easy to learn,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.540
but hard to master.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.710
So what you'll see when I
describe the game specs--

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.730
and I'm going into it just
momentarily --when I describe

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.540
game specs you'll see ways
to play the game, and then

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.250
ways to excel at the game.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.820
So it's like you've got
this infinite ramp, that you

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.360
can run wild on, of
how much effort you

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.990
want to put into
developing the best player.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.060
Or better yet, because
what is the best?

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.160
It's comparative.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.690
That's comparing
to somebody else.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.780
But that's kind of irrelevant.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.988
What you want is to have fun.

00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:34.435
Anyway, you know that.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:35.060
So there we go.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.290
Our idea was to not
have sort of skill caps

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.060
and limiting factors,
like maps that are just

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.420
covered in maze so
you can't do anything

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.850
unless you can get
past that maze.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.120
Like, OK, you didn't
pass the test,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.280
I hope you enjoy
your starting area.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.870
No, no.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.550
So not that.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.550
So let me show the game.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.830
How many of you have
seen Battlecode before?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.140
A show of hands.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.400
So that's a good number,
but it's not everybody.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.860
So I'm going to show you a game.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.080
So this is when
you've made your code

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.555
and you've put it
into the client,

00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:09.180
you can run a game
like this, and we'll

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.756
go over how to do that.

00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:12.380
And I'll just hit
play here, and you'll

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.870
see the red team
in the upper left,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.580
and the blue team
in the bottom right,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.030
playing a game of
Battlecode for this year.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.750
The player on the
upper left, in red,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.170
is placing mines,
and capturing bases.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.520
His soldiers are moving around
and fighting with one another.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.250
Fighting the enemy, hopefully.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.560
And the blue player,
here at the bottom right,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.380
is just sort of
shooting his guys off

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.120
to die at the enemy army.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.490
On the left you'll
see indicators

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.600
of various game constants
and values that are changing.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.290
If I pause this
for a second, you

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.190
can see by clicking
on any robot,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.030
you can see his ID number,
what robot type it is.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.700
You can see his hit
point level, which

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.720
we have characteristically had
a very difficult to remember

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.257
name for.

00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:03.840
We always have different names
for their energy and their head

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.070
points this year it's going to
be, "energon," for hit points.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.230
I think this flux number is
actually no longer relevant,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.538
and you can ignore it.

00:08:13.538 --> 00:08:15.510
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.290
PROFESSOR: See,
we worked so hard

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.500
on making this
polished and perfect,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.639
that we weren't finished
until-- actually we're

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:23.930
not finished yet, they're
still fussing with something.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.660
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.710
PROFESSOR: The
bytecodes used is going

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.490
to be a key factor that you're
going to look at so that you

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.159
can determine how much
computational energy

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.679
those robots are spending.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.179
This year, there's
a very big impact

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.919
on the efficiency of your
code, and the performance

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.840
of your player.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.560
If you have efficient code, you
could have twice as many robots

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.210
on the field then
you can sustain

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.710
if your code is inefficient.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.980
Because the actual
computational cost

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.600
is recorded, and
is then implemented

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.620
into the upkeep of each unit.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.250
Finally, you'll see the
location of the unit, and three

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.850
indicator strings that you can
use for debugging and control

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.440
purposes.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.630
So what we'll do today is talk
about what kinds of things

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.550
are on this map, and how that's
different and amazingly great,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.180
and how this year's new gameplay
will be even more fun than it

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.430
ever has been.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.040
And I can say that
with some confidence,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.710
because it's quite different
and demonstrably better.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.120
Yes.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.710
So what we think of
as skill areas, areas

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.570
that make a fun
game for Battlecode,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.285
are, navigation-- but not
that you so much require

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.480
it --see, in this example,
they didn't really

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.350
need any complex maze
solving algorithms.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.470
What they were just doing, is
there are these neutral mines

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.784
that are here, and you
could either walk around

00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:50.450
the neutral minefield,
or you could just

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.908
clear yourself
right on through it.

00:09:51.908 --> 00:09:54.120
So there's navigation,
but you don't necessarily

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.750
have to do it.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.470
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.900
PROFESSOR: There's
group pathing--

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.812
and that's a good point
because, you know,

00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:05.240
OK, anybody can take one
unit and after enough time,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.810
figure out how to implement
any of the existing pathing

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.440
algorithms.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.550
But let's say you've
got multiple units.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.550
They start to get in
one another's way.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.910
Let me give an example
that's very concrete,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.220
and that hits really
close to home, for me.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.960
I did this all the time--
I've done Battlecode,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.980
I guess, like four years now.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.900
And so what I'd always
have is, I'm here,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:33.430
and I want to go to ice
cream-- something desirable

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.310
--and I'm trying to
get past this wall.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.760
So I go here, but then all my
friends take up all this space

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.470
because they're
going the same way.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.014
And then I'm trying to
turn around, and go back,

00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:44.930
and they're trying to
go this way because they

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.990
think it's closer
to the ice cream.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.890
And we just end up here
all day, and then the enemy

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.020
comes by and shoots us.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.370
And then we've got
holes in ourselves,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.460
how are we going to
maintain that stomach

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.650
area to keep the ice cream in?

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.980
It's just not going to work.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.340
So we like navigation,
we like group pathing.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.390
We like messaging.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.190
This year, the messaging
system is totally new.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.304
In the past, what
you'd need is--

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.720
I'm going to go
back to the screen

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.840
here --is your
robot would only be

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.230
able to see a certain
area around himself.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.900
And so every other
robot would not

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.440
know what's going on, on the
whole map, except by messaging.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.630
But even then, they would
have to receive messages

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.622
that are broadcast
within a certain range.

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:30.830
So you end up having to make
these chains where you'd

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.960
say, all right,
I've got, let's see,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.430
Joe, and James, and Jalopy.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.080
They're all in line, and these
three robots are in line,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.430
and they each have
some broadcast radius.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.370
And so maybe I can, sort
of, set up a relay chain,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.100
and they're broadcasting back.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.640
And that was how you used
to communicate information

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.960
about where the enemy is.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.810
So here's the ice cream,
here, and here's me.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.100
And I would have to hear
it from these four guys.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.027
But that would end up
being a lot of work

00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:03.860
for me to implement.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.360
And we like that, we
think that's really cool.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.140
But at the same time
it ended up meaning

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.150
that if the ice
cream were an enemy,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.710
and I needed to scout
that the enemy were coming

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.874
with some rush, that
what would often happen

00:12:18.874 --> 00:12:20.790
is that there wouldn't
be a chain established.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.860
Because this kind of
stuff's kind of hard do.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.807
So this guy would see the enemy
right here-- and here's me,

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:27.640
back here, I'm just
minding my own business.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.700
Maybe I'm building a staircase,
which we did in one year.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.440
Or some other very useful
expenditure of effort and time.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.030
So this guy sees the enemy
and I don't know about it,

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.810
I can't prepare
until he comes back.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.590
OK, so then he comes back
to within broadcast range--

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.850
he's here --but by then
the enemy is right there.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.390
I can't do anything.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.550
So what we've done
this year, is we've

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.630
said all right, realistically
we've got these radios, right?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.050
Let's communicate, on these
radios, across the whole map.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.260
So now your radio messages can
be heard across the whole map.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.242
But, instead of being messages,
like they used to be--

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.950
and these messages
were kind of annoying,

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.790
they were these constructs
that you had to assemble.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.920
You'd say, oh, I'm
making a new message

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.770
and I'm applying
these parts to it.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.860
And not every message
has every type of part.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.904
And not every part as
every type of message.

00:13:17.904 --> 00:13:19.320
And every time I
receive a message

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.460
I can receive an
infinity of messages.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.550
And then my robot
explodes because he's

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.260
being overloaded with messages.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.020
That's like spam, happens
a lot, it happens to me.

00:13:31.654 --> 00:13:33.570
So what we get instead,
is we said, all right,

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.580
we've got a uniform
message channel.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.320
We've got 10,000 channels.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.370
And any robot can
post an integer

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.240
to any one of those
channels, at any time.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.120
So then my robot could be
posting-- maybe my code

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.530
is using frequency 567.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.330
And I'll be communicating on
that frequency specifically

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.312
where I'm going, or what
direction I'm going,

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:55.270
or something like that.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.220
And everybody on
my team can see it.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.330
So that's a really useful
sort of centralizing feature.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.900
So if the enemy is
coming, I can just

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.760
look on integer number 567, and
if the enemy is coming, maybe

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.510
that's a flag,
maybe I make that, I

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.890
guess, 666 because
that's really bad.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.500
Right?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.990
So I make that my token for
enemy is coming, and then bing,

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.100
everybody can start preparing
for the enemy coming.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.660
But there's more,
I mean, let's say

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.910
you're going to metagame them.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.150
You're going to think about what
could happen from a high level.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.940
Like when would the
enemy just invade?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.740
When would they attack me?

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.580
I mean, I don't have to see them
coming to know that they will.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.350
For example, maybe the
map is really small.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.790
So this year, you can
tell how big the map is.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.410
I mean, how does it make sense--
this happened again and again

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.680
in previous years --how
does it make sense

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.600
to have a game, where players
are expected to operate

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.590
intelligently, in the
absence of information.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.520
OK, I understand that sometimes
a little bit of uncertainty

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.190
can be great.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.290
Like how great poker
be if everybody

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.830
knows what everybody
else's hand is?

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.690
That would be
really lousy, right?

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.490
But here, we just had
almost no information,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.080
so you'd have
build-order losses.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.770
This is sort of a big problem,
in my eyes, with StarCraft.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.300
Which is that you'd start
with a strategy that

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.360
could lose before you have any
information on how to fix that.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.580
So at least in StarCraft
you know how big the map is.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.400
So here we're giving them
the following centralized

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.300
information.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.800
So here's what I'll do.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.030
I'm going to list out the
centralized information

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.230
that you can use, that
you didn't really used

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.820
to have access to.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.714
Now you might ask, all right
I'm not going to memorize this,

00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:51.380
and I'm not taking
notes-- even though I

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.840
did bring a thingamabober, which
is a computer, or a notebook.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.040
You might say, I'm not
going to memorize this,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.460
I'm not interested,
I'm here to have fun.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.430
Well look here, you can
look in the Java docs

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.820
and you can see all of
the robot abilities.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.029
They're listed in
this giant list here,

00:16:09.029 --> 00:16:10.570
and you'll have time
to peruse those.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.510
And we'll sort of go
over them over the course

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.180
of the few lectures.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.220
But having them sort
of in a condensed form

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.400
or organized into
topics, like what

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.900
is centralized information?

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.630
You know, what
information can I use?

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.110
Ends up probably being
a bit of a convenience.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.760
So I have a couple of convenient
organizations of data.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.750
And that's really all
I'm here for is just--

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.720
you can get all this information
in our documentation,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.930
which we'll supply you when
we help you set up the game.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.240
And/or you can sort of hear
it from me, where I've got it

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.220
sort of organized into a
slightly different way.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.550
The centralized
info that you get

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:55.510
includes, you can sense the
positions of all allied robots.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.150
So there's a function, and
again, we have very good naming

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.800
conventions so that all
of the names that we pick

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.560
let you know exactly
what we're referring to.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.510
And for this function we call
it-- it's a method called,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:16.700
"Sense Nearby Game Objects."

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.359
And that's great because
it can detect game objects

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:25.579
across the map, anywhere,
they don't have to be nearby.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.390
So that that's really nice.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.590
And it senses these things,
which of course, you

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.740
would want to sense.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.440
They're objects!

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.880
You know, I was playing chess
the other day with my friend

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.890
Rick, and I said
to him, you know

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.520
what I could use more
of is game objects.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.690
I can sense all of
your game objects.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.600
And he didn't get it.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.430
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.860
PROFESSOR: So Sense
Nearby Game Objects

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.900
is an overloaded
function, which means

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.930
that you can call it
with multiple arguments.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.880
And that really does help you.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.710
So the point is, this
is a global function,

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:10.440
because you can see any game
object if that game object is

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.320
of a certain type.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.390
So all of your allied
robots you can see.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:20.130
Let's go back to our example,
let's say that I am back here,

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.460
that's me, over
here at the bottom.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.440
And this guy up
at the top, I can

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.280
see where he is back from here.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.690
But my sight range is
actually only here.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:37.010
So I've got different
detection abilities.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.320
Allied robots, allied
mines, and neutral mines,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.800
are all visible no
matter where you are,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.491
but enemy robots are only
visible within your sight

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:49.990
radius.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.260
But it's within any
allied robot site radius.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.930
It's harder to explain
than it is to think about.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.430
In this picture, this
robot can see these guys,

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.080
because he's really close.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.010
But this guy can also see them,
because this robot is nearby.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.750
Right, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.070
One person was nodding
but he was also yawning,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.760
so he may have been nodding off.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.350
No, I'm only joking.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.760
Yeah, zing!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.860
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.970
PROFESSOR: Sense
Nearby Game Objects

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.410
is a kind of useful
thing to be able to do,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.430
but it's not always
obvious how to use it.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.570
So, later on, I'll
be talking about how

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.310
one of the inputs to
this is what type of game

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.876
object you want.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:39.000
I still haven't-- I've been
saying game object over

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.860
and over, but none of you
care about game objects.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.190
You care about
enemy robots, I want

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.990
to shoot at the enemy robots.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.080
So you would end up writing,
oh, I want a robot please.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.560
So you tell it, give me game
objects of type Robot.class.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.140
And you would say,
all right, this

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.620
is getting kind of confusing.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.400
I'm feeling a little
bit overwhelmed.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.350
Well don't you worry about it,
because here in the Java Docs,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.650
under package-- and you might
notice that this is the Java

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.100
docs version 7,
for Java version 7.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.020
It's real sleek.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.090
We're distributing this
at absolutely no cost.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.590
Yeah.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.120
Let's see here, oh, look!

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.060
It's game object.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.650
There it is.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.150
And oh, look, subinterfaces
include encampments and robots.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.180
Well that's great, that
answers my question.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.910
So now I know that I can put
Robot.class or Encampment.class

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.880
and it will give me that
type of game object.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.780
Yeah.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.300
Yeah!

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.507
All right.

00:20:43.507 --> 00:20:49.980
[LAUGHS]

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.130
So that's a piece of
centralized information.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.130
Another piece of
centralized info--

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.675
so we've talked about
how it's allied robots.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.960
There's allied mines.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.350
I'll talk about the mines and
how you can lay them and defuse

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:14.930
them, and how you get these
things onto the game board.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.430
Allied robots, allied mines.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.980
You've got the radio system,
which is entirely global.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.680
And that means that you can
disrupt somebody else's radio

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.590
program.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.150
I have a hunch that there are
several people out there who

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:35.260
would broadcast random numbers
to my favorite channel, 567,

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.330
and it would just
totally ruin my player.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.420
I wouldn't be able
to work at all.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.030
Now, in order to limit
this sort of-- there's sort

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.510
of a back and forth
between sending messages

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.190
that you want to send,
receiving the messages

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.250
with a certain amount of,
sort of, redundancy in there,

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.010
so you can be safe
against message jamming,

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.720
versus actual jamming itself.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.440
How do we assess the balance
of these competing objectives?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.720
Well we've got a cost
associated with everything.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.640
There's no free lunch.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.230
Except dinner for Battlecode.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.400
And that is actually free.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.200
We ordered so much
pizza for today.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.540
Now I'm sure not many of you
ordered that much pizza before.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.720
But let me tell
you that I expected

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.820
that-- there's like 120
people here in the room,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.100
and we thought how much
pizza does everybody eat?

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.990
Well unfortunately Battlecode
is a male dominated class.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.670
So we'll have slightly
more pizza consumption

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.790
than otherwise.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.010
Is that sexist?

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.540
And so--

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.250
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.410
PROFESSOR: So we decided
to get 50 pizzas.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.290
And we were like, well
what's awesome pizza?

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.920
We like Bertucci's.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.241
You guys don't like Bertucci's.

00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:48.740
Yeah!

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.760
He likes Bertucci's.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.340
Yeah, so that was
like $20 a pizza.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.150
So it was like $1000 for pizza.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.110
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.090
PROFESSOR: My goodness.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.050
Well anyway, it's going
to be really good.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.760
And it's coming in
like a half an hour.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.135
That's fantastic-- I've totally
lost my train of thought.

00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:06.474
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.474 --> 00:23:07.390
PROFESSOR: Right I was

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.930
AUDIENCE: --message him.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.596
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:13.330
I was saying that there's
no free lunch, and as such,

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.160
we have a bytecode cost.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.360
Now, I think in the past it's
not been that obvious to me

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.240
what the cost of doing a
certain computation is.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.480
Can I jam the enemy?

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.350
Is that really going to work, or
am I going to run out of money?

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.180
Is a question you could ask.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.800
So here, in the--
let's see here,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.159
I have a place where I
have installed Battlecode.

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.700
And you're going to
do something just

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.642
like this, where you'll have
that Battlecode-- that's OK,

00:23:42.642 --> 00:23:43.850
he had to go to the bathroom.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.766
Don't worry about him.

00:23:44.766 --> 00:23:48.574
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:23:48.574 --> 00:23:50.490
PROFESSOR: Well it's a
reasonable supposition,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.500
he is human, isn't he?

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.630
All right, and so here, in
the Battlecode directory

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.550
where I've installed
Battlecode, there's

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.800
going to be a text file
that's called method costs.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.890
Bingo.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.700
All right now it
looks disorganized

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.090
because everything-- the
strings are different lengths.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.150
But each string represents
a function that you can use.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.530
Like for example attack square.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.029
Or maybe broadcast a message.

00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:16.820
Ah, that was the one
we were interested in.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.510
OK, let's look at that.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.151
Broadcast costs 25 bytecodes.

00:24:21.151 --> 00:24:23.400
All right, let's do a little
bit of math-- arithmetic,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.690
it's not math, is it?

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.880
25 bytecodes, all right?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.960
There are 10,000 strings,
which I wrote and erased.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.070
10,000 places to
write a message to.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.210
There are 25 bytecodes
to broadcast a message.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.600
OK, so that means that I
can broadcast 400 messages.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.260
Is that right?

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:48.430
Is that this number divided by
that number equals that number?

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.090
Is that-- Yeah, yeah.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.275
Yeah, let's go with it.

00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:55.790
Yeah, let's go with that.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.670
So you have 400.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.800
No, but maybe you have more of
your robots jamming signals.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.410
OK, how many robots
can you have?

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.340
All right, let's do
that computation.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.680
I'm pretending that I'm you,
and that I'm just like-- OK

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.910
I'm not doing a very
good impersonation.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.950
I recognize that.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.980
You'd be much faster at this.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.530
So you would want to find
out how many robots you

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.310
can sustain.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.410
Can I get somebody to
suggest one way to figure out

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.010
that number?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:28.900
Yes!

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.930
You, you, you.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.690
Ah yes you could make a
player and just spawn robots

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.280
until they start dying.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.460
Let's say you wanted to
do it in a different way.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.520
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.130
PROFESSOR: I have
the example here.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.170
What is It?

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.550
Game constants, there we are.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.870
So here I'm looking
at the Java docs,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.350
and I can click
on game constants.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.000
I'm looking at a
different version of it

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.340
that didn't actually show the
game constants in the game

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.950
constants page.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.820
But that's because we
are well organized.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.420
And this is to show that we're
indomitable, indefatigable,

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.810
as it were.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.270
These constant values
indicate, here,

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.970
that your headquarters
is capable of producing

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.870
quite a few resources.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.730
This shows that it produces
50 resources per turn.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.510
This resource
production enables you

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.290
to have an upkeep of robots.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.420
So in the past, we've had
names like flux, and so on.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.500
This year, the name
for it is power.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.760
That's tough though because
we have time as well.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.320
And as you well know power
times time is energy.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.930
And so now we have
energon and energy,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.630
which is a multiple or a
calculated quantity from power.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.270
But don't you worry
too much about it.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.680
It's just a number.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.900
And the usage of this
resource, or power, by robots,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.390
is displayed in unit upkeep.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.066
Which here, is
written incorrectly.

00:27:03.066 --> 00:27:04.440
I'm going to be
bring up the most

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.820
recent version of this document.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.589
What's nice is that you
guys will get one version,

00:27:10.589 --> 00:27:12.630
and then you'll have one
version on your computer

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.810
and not, like, 16.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.670
And your one version
will be up to date.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.810
And when you want to
update it, the client

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.890
will automatically tell
you that it needs updating.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.080
So you'll just have
the one version,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.800
and you won't have
disaster area.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.040
Yeah, constant value.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.300
So this is the more
recently updated one.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.400
And you can see here the
unit power upkeep is one.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.275
All right, fantastic.

00:27:36.275 --> 00:27:39.970
We're ready to do a computation.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.110
So I'm going to
put here 40 divided

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.975
by-- so this is the
amount of energy,

00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:48.600
or the amount of
power, that's produced

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.080
per turn by your
headquarters divided

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.100
by the usage of that power.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.000
Now you're going to say,
all right, I'm bored.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.300
I can do this in my head.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.320
Well maybe you can but some
of us can't, all right?

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.120
No, so that would be the number.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.680
But that would say that the
number of robots you get

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.790
is independent of how
much work they're doing.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.320
And that doesn't make any sense.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.140
You should get to
have more robots

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.730
if you're doing
less computation.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.380
So here you can see,
there is a cost.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.460
Power cost per
bytecode, which is here.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.110
And it's 10 to the minus 4.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:35.650
So let's say that I'm
using-- 10 to the minus 4

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:37.120
times the number bytecodes.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.470
Well, if I'm using zero
byte codes, then I get 40.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.786
Because that would be 1 plus 0.

00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:46.255
And 40 over one is 40.

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:49.080
OK and if I were
using 10,000, which

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.170
is also known as 10 to the 4.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.060
Then I would get 20.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.040
Wow, what a big difference.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.040
So that tells you that if
you want to go ahead and spam

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.060
the message system--
let's say you're spamming,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.090
so you're using all of
your bytecodes possible,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.760
and you have 20 robots.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.270
So 20 robots are spamming 400
message integers per turn.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.620
So you're doing nothing
but spamming the messages.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:24.630
And you're getting eight,
zero, zero, ze-- Oh, ahh, ahh.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.430
Oh, it's not even enough.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.040
It's not enough.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.080
Well, so that shows that
you could jam the enemy.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.100
And maybe you should, if you've
got nothing better to do,

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.520
if you derive a personal
satisfaction from it.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.690
But this is worth saying.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.090
These kinds of calculations
are important for strategy.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.890
But don't make them
totally fixed in stone.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.600
Because we change
the game, we tweak

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.130
it a little bit for balance.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.070
So if it ends up being that
10,000 is just so much radio

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.570
space that we just would
rather not have it,

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.590
then it could just get
knocked down to 1000.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.240
And then all of a sudden
your player, which

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.010
depends on this or that
messaging construct,

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.370
may have to be
somewhat rethought.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.620
So this is a good time to
talk about the organization

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.720
of the competition.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.830
Is it?

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.870
I think it is.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.011
Let's go to the
Battlecode website.

00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:24.260
And let me show you something.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.051
I don't know I knew
that you could do this.

00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:29.770
But previous years
we've had like a list.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.990
And it'll be in
text form, and it'll

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.830
say on this date we have this
competition, and this one.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.090
And then you have to
open up a window of this.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.900
And then every single
one of you opens up

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.210
another window with
Gmail or Google Calendar.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.510
And then you like manually enter
in the-- do you not do that?

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.390
Who has to do that whenever
you have a competition,

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.830
you want to know
when things are?

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.670
Yeah, yeah there's
like two people who

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.140
also have to do that.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.160
So I figured, in light of saving
those two people some effort,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.490
we made this Google Calendar.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.900
And you could see, here's
today's classroom session,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.690
here in 1-190 from
5:00 to 6:00 PM.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.510
And it's got the
lab written there.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:14.380
So the specs and software are
released, as of 37 minutes ago,

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.886
roughly speaking.

00:31:15.886 --> 00:31:17.260
And what we'll
do, after this, is

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.700
we'll talk about
how to set it up.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.800
So there you go, specs
and software are released.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.000
The sprint tournament
is on the 14th.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.150
And what that means is you
can submit a player for that,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:32.170
and you can be entered for a
relatively small prize pool.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.810
Relatively small,
the actual prize

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.450
pool for the finals
is I think $50,000.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.487
So relatively small
is just some fraction

00:31:38.487 --> 00:31:40.070
of that which is
still non-negligible.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.420
Anyway, so that's going to be
really exciting because that

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.620
will give you the opportunity
to test your code out

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.770
to see what other players
are doing, because to

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.460
some extent winning
is going to be

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.980
related to what other people do.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.570
But more importantly,
having fun is

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.417
related to what other
people do, and talking

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:00.250
to the other people.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.000
Like this social utopia of
mine, the idea of this lab,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.660
is totally new-- as well
as the Google Calendar

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.140
--to try to make things more
easy and fun and together,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.520
among us as Battlecoders.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.840
Because we do all
share that common link.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.450
Yes.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.590
So the point is
that if you didn't

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.170
know you could do
this, what you do

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.750
is you go to-- if you want to
add this to your own calendar,

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.600
there's like a button where
you can go and do that.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.490
I think the button isn't
available because-- Yeah,

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.242
there.

00:32:34.242 --> 00:32:35.357
There?

00:32:35.357 --> 00:32:35.940
At the bottom.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.870
At the bottom?

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.784
Yeah, there you go.

00:32:37.784 --> 00:32:39.200
And then you just
add it right in,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.110
so I've already got it here,
in my personal calendar.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.100
And there you go, so
you can see that I'm

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.870
having lunch on the 24th.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.050
And OK, so you get the idea.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.710
So the sprint tournament
is-- the submission deadline,

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.210
you can see here,
is on the 14th.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.087
On the 16th, on that
Wednesday, in class,

00:32:57.087 --> 00:32:59.420
we'll show some of the games
from the sprint tournament.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.961
I don't think we'll
show all of them.

00:33:00.961 --> 00:33:03.800
See because what used to happen,
is we would show all the games.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.120
And there's like 100 teams.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.130
And that ends up being
a relatively large size

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.280
round-robin bracket with, I
think, double elimination.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.400
So it's a ton of games.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.250
I think it generally
takes like five hours.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.630
But it ends up bumping up to
six, seven, or eight hours

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.230
because we end up
showing up there,

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.130
and the tournament code that
sets it all up doesn't work.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.536
And so it takes forever.

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:26.910
So we're going to
do this year is

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.360
we'll just sort to
distill it down,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.818
we'll have something
simple to show

00:33:29.818 --> 00:33:32.570
that's fantastic and
exciting on the Wednesday.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.950
And in the future, when we
have our later-- our seating

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.696
tournament, which is sort
of the same kind of thing,

00:33:38.696 --> 00:33:41.320
but it's more important, because
it determines your positioning

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.500
for the final tournament.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.724
When we have this
seating tournament,

00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:46.640
we're going to live
stream it on the internet,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.306
so that you don't
even have to-- I mean,

00:33:48.306 --> 00:33:51.260
you guys all trekked out
here in the dead of night

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:56.930
and 5:00 or 6:00 PM
in the freezing cold.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.040
I mean there could be people out
there dying because they tried

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.270
to make it here and
they didn't make it.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.700
That would be horrible, that's
not something to laugh at.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.150
So you came all
the way out here,

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.659
but we don't want to make you
have to do that much work.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.070
Because we want you to have fun.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.736
So there you go.

00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:16.761
We've got a calendar to
save you that effort.

00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:18.969
We have lab sessions to save
you the effort of trying

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.270
to make friends, and
we'll have live streams

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.909
in the future, which will
make that much better.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.580
So as you can see here, it
says the seating tournament

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.710
submission deadline
is on the 21st.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.800
And the seating tournament
will be on the 22nd.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.719
So what that does, is it gets
you your position in the finals

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.554
tournament.

00:34:37.554 --> 00:34:39.720
The finals submission
deadline is different, though.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.830
So you can continually
update your player.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.440
My point is that you
only have three weeks.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.900
It's the 7th today.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.190
And the finals submission
deadline is the 28th.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.340
You have three weeks to
make an amazing player.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.170
And each week, you'll
have the chance

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.489
to-- you could upload
your player at any time,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.730
you can do scrimmage matches
with other players at any time.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.980
And then finally, you'll be
able to submit to the finals.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.400
I mean, I don't think it's
worth getting too hyped up

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:11.029
about this final thing because
after all, in my experience,

00:35:11.029 --> 00:35:13.570
game changes at the last minute
screw you over at the finals,

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.630
and ends up being a crap shoot.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.610
No, no, I exaggerate.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.220
But the point is, the fun
should be had as you go.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.930
And I am here to help with that.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.660
So what you need--
so just one more

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.680
thing about this
administration is

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:36.350
that I think that it's required
that you upload a resume,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.892
and that you be an MIT student
if you want to earn-- no,

00:35:40.892 --> 00:35:41.600
that's not right.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.440
We have international
competitors, this year.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.790
We have sort of a thing going on
with the University of Sussex.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.659
If you have friends
at other universities,

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:50.950
they can feel free to join you.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.880
And they don't have
to be MIT students

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.010
to either play or win money.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:36:00.630
And if they're in
Honolulu, or Alaska,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.350
we'll fly them in
here for the finals

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.900
because we expect the finalists
to show up at this dinner

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.110
that we have at the Hyatt.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.980
We have this fantastically
lavish dinner.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:17.587
I think we paid
like $5,000 for it.

00:36:17.587 --> 00:36:19.170
Aaron, could you
come up here and show

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.350
what the sponsors
are by just turning

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.890
your back to the audience?

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.125
No, actually there's a
button here, I can do that.

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:26.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.740
OK, so here are our sponsors.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.350
We have these fancy company
reps show up at this dinner.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.050
So if you're among
the finalists,

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.740
then you show up at
the fancy reps dinner

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.700
and they offer you
jobs and stuff.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.240
It's apparently very
nice, I've never been.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.660
AUDIENCE: [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.370
Yeah, that's because I was busy.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.410
Yeah, that's why.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.190
Yeah, that's why.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.700
That's why.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.730
No.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.810
So these are some
of the sponsors.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:54.009
Our main sponsors
and some other ones.

00:36:54.009 --> 00:36:56.550
And you'll get a chance to meet
them, as well, at the finals.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.300
So you don't have to be the best
of the best by whatever stupid

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.600
metric we come up with.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.730
What you have to
be is-- anybody who

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:08.380
does Battlecode is an attractive
person to these employers who

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.900
will meet you and give
you business cards.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.080
And it'll be a good
time for everyone.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.890
And so in that note
you have, once again,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.630
on the calendar page, the finals
are on the 2nd of February.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.300
So that'll be when that
happens and it'll be in 26-100.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.680
It'll be a blast, and you
should be looking forward

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.780
to that very much.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.980
I feel like I've
just been droning on,

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.620
ranting about what I don't
like about StarCraft.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.850
And I haven't talked enough
about the things that

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.800
are related to
gameplay this year.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.115
This year, you
have these robots.

00:37:48.115 --> 00:37:53.140
It's astounding to me, that I--
Oh, is that why it didn't work?

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.300
Because I was using this
one instead of this one,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.650
and I meant to use
this main client?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.260
Yeah, that's the one.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.990
OK, yeah.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.710
This was the point I was
trying to make earlier.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.250
Where I was going to
take compute time bot,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.320
playing against compute
time bot, on this map.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.710
This is sort of how
to do it, but it'll

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.580
be done a little
bit differently.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:23.550
And so the goal here is to see
how many robots can be built.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.110
But this guy-- Ah!

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.830
I think team A and
B got switched.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:31.780
So what I'll do is I'll just
briefly switch around the code.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.470
So this is sort of the
structure of a robot controller.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.210
What happens is this code is
run on each robot on your team,

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.810
and that's what plays the game.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.900
I'm sure most of you
know that already.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.630
And so what I'll do is I'll
just check that the team is B.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:51.340
So I can switch the team,
hit Save, run it again.

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:55.840
Well it doesn't
work as well as I

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.548
was expecting because
these guys are just

00:38:57.548 --> 00:39:00.500
dying when they go
through the minefield.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.430
That's interesting.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.100
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.310
PROFESSOR: You know, you can
make your own maps in this.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.580
This is a really good
example of debugging.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.355
And you can say that
I did this on purpose.

00:39:11.355 --> 00:39:13.480
Although if you have a
strict adherence to honesty,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.790
you might not.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.050
So the maps are located where?

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.870
You're looking at what, here?

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.790
So you'll have a directory
where you can see your maps.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.990
And you'll be also
able to see them here.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.110
So here's simple.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.380
And what if I want
to edit this map.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.460
Can I do that?

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.220
Can I just double click it?

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.370
It's an XML document.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.330
Oh, look.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.780
Is it?

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.290
Oh, data, OK.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.830
Here's some data.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.552
I'm beginning to get
to the part-- see,

00:39:44.552 --> 00:39:46.260
this would be really
easy if I could just

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.167
do edit with notepad.

00:39:48.167 --> 00:39:49.500
AUDIENCE: --source at the bottom

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.770
PROFESSOR: Source!

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.640
No.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.502
PROFESSOR: Tab.

00:39:56.502 --> 00:39:57.624
AUDIENCE: No, down.

00:39:57.624 --> 00:39:58.290
PROFESSOR: Down?

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:58.789
Down.

00:39:58.789 --> 00:40:00.550
AUDIENCE: Where design is.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.180
PROFESSOR: Oh!

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.984
Bingo.

00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:02.484
All right!

00:40:02.484 --> 00:40:03.720
Yeah, thank you.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.800
So then, you can
see that I can make

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.100
my own maps using these codes.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.750
So the character "3"
indicates a neutral mine.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.600
So I can just do like a find
replace, were I'll replace "3"

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.610
with ".", which is
an open terrain.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.307
I'll just do replace all.

00:40:17.307 --> 00:40:18.890
And then I'll just
make sure to change

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:22.374
this one or else the
whole map would be mines.

00:40:22.374 --> 00:40:24.540
I'm sure two of you thought
that I wouldn't do that,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.660
but I assure you that I'm
operating at full capacity.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.320
All right, so this is an
example where you can see I've

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.720
just built bunch of robots.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.830
And you can see that
this is my power.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.690
Your power stored
in a reserve bank.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.422
And what I'm going to do
is suddenly at round 1,000,

00:40:42.422 --> 00:40:43.880
I'm going to start
computing a lot.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.546
So right now you can
see that this robot

00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:47.250
is using 38 bytecodes.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:47.990
Not very many.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.940
If you're amazing
at counting you'll

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.390
see that there
are about 40 here.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.630
And the new robots-- oh, boom!

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.730
Look at that.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.320
The new robots died because they
don't have enough-- these guys

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.710
don't have enough compute-- they
don't have enough power to run.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.390
So they lose hit points
until they're dead.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.850
And then if they all
start using code,

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.240
boom, when we cut down
to half the number.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.080
And so you could
see quite visually

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.360
the effect of using 10,000
bytecodes versus using

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.280
no bytecodes at all.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.160
So from here, down to there.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.910
Bang.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:31.580
This power quantity can be
affected by various things.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.430
So there are some equations that
I could show for what that is.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.590
But maybe I've just gone
a bit far field here

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.580
because I've been talking
about some details.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.010
Here's the general
overview, right?

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.800
You don't really need too
many of the specifics,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.257
because all you've got
to do is find the enemy.

00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.840
And there's a function
that does that.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.590
Oh, look at that, I'll just
add that to the global list.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:42:00.820
There's, "Sense Enemy
Headquarters," bingo.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.760
Done.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.530
If you were interested in
a little bit of masochism,

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.190
coding masochism, and just
doing something the hard way,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.960
you could do that.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.120
Because what we've
also provided,

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.070
is the dimensions
of the map, and you

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.800
know that the upper left
corner of the map is 0,0.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.985
So with a symmetry
operation you could say,

00:42:16.985 --> 00:42:18.650
my headquarters is here.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.970
The map size is this.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.400
My location is here.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.020
Therefore, the enemy must
be at this other location.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.772
So more than one way to skin
a cat, as the case may be.

00:42:27.772 --> 00:42:29.730
So you locate the enemy,
and all you have to do

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:30.710
is walk up to him.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.070
Because this year attacking
happens automatically

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.080
for soldiers.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.270
So right now there isn't
any fighting going on.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.660
But I'll show an
example that will

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.500
show that all they've got to
do is go near one another,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.450
and then their attack
power is distributed

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:52.680
among all of the
robots they can see.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.460
So this is some old
code that we were

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.570
writing when we were
testing the game.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.230
And what you'll
find is that when

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.370
robots come close
to one another,

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:06.334
they make these circles that
indicate their attack range.

00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:08.750
So they're attacking-- this
guy is distributing his attack

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.620
among this one and that one.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.910
Similarly, this one is
distributing among these three.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.720
So his attack power in
this version of the game

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.560
was different.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.450
But right now I believe
the attack power is six.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.700
So he would be dealing two
damage to each of these.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.150
What you also see in
this picture, which

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.270
I believe is quite instructive,
is the shield robots.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:40.110
Yeah, any robot that's standing
next to this shields robot

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.900
will be given this
additional shields parameter.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.347
And so you can see it here
in the user interface.

00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:46.930
There's a green bar
indicating health,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.940
and a blue bar
indicating shields.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.050
In the latest implementation
of Battlecode,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.150
shields serve as
a protection only

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.500
against a certain type of
encampment that can be built.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.700
So is these encampments
work in the following way.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.680
You start with just
a headquarters,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.150
and that produces
these soldiers.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.470
So you can produce a soldier
at any tile around you,

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.190
if that tile is unoccupied.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:19.770
That soldier can then be used
to construct an encampment.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.840
And he can construct any of a
number of types of encampment.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.260
So I've made this nice, handy,
useful Battlecode data sheet.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.770
People from last
year might remember

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.720
that I made sort of a handy
unit sheet at that time.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.990
But this year it's 100% more
accurate than last year's.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.480
That's right.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.040
We've checked and
double checked,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.650
but this is the latest version.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.400
So you can see here all of
the different types of units.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.520
And there's a Boolean for
whether it is an encampment,

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.990
in terms of just a description.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:53.865
Although, you know, that's kind
of not a fantastic description.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.170
Because all of these
units-- you know,

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.040
because we like to
be straightforward.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.660
It's a realistic
preparation for your life

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.090
as a professional coder, that
the database and documentation

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.960
you receive will contain
information opposite to the way

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.412
that things are run.

00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:13.870
So you can see here that they're
all listed-- some of these

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.300
are listed as encampments.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.540
But in fact they are all robots.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.830
Yes, I believe that's correct.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.460
They are all robots.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.310
So the headquarters is
what you start with.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:31.110
It generates 40 power turn, and
it can spawn these soldiers.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.579
It takes 10 turns
to spawn a soldier.

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:36.120
Or it can research upgrades,
and I'll talk about the upgrades

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.560
below, in just a minute.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.510
The soldier has an upkeep
of 1 to 2 power per turn,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.240
depending on byte code usage.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.280
It automatically
distributes its attack power

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.830
among adjacent enemy units.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.220
And it has the
capability of laying

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.410
mines, which take 25
turns to lay a mine.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.380
Defusing mines, which take
5 turns, and capturing

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.797
encampments, which
takes 50 turns.

00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.255
Now you might ask,
all right, where

00:46:00.255 --> 00:46:01.430
am I getting these numbers?

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.400
I'm assembling this
sort of convenient

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.050
diagram but what if
the specs change?

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.675
You know, where do
I get these numbers?

00:46:06.675 --> 00:46:09.740
Well they're all under game
constants under robot type

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.730
enum, or the upgrade
enum, and you'll

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.470
find them all the Java docs.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.250
Alternatively, you
could all always

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.080
ask us where they are by
going on our IRC chat,

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.780
or talking to one
of us in person.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.620
So you can see here they're
laying mines, defusing mines,

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.950
capturing encampments.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.340
And in the act of capturing
one of these encampments, which

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.870
is a pre-existing location on
the map, these black circles.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.600
In the act of capturing
one of those--

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.970
there's nothing
magical about it.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.020
Because here, among the
robot controller methods,

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.690
you'll find capture encampment.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.900
And what you'll do is
you'll specify what type

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.600
of enchantment
you want it to be.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.459
And you might ask,
what types are there?

00:46:51.459 --> 00:46:53.250
Well, you could either
look at handy chart,

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.430
or you could click
here, under robot type.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.130
And this enum robot type
will show you the types

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.590
that you can build.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:03.000
You can build artillery,
generator, medbay, shields,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.130
and supplier.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.990
The headquarters and
soldier are different.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.224
They're not built
from encampments.

00:47:09.224 --> 00:47:11.640
I don't know if that's written
anywhere, but I've said it,

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.720
so now you know it.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.490
Yeah.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:20.020
So that's how you're going to be
able to build these units, that

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:20.800
are shown here.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.460
So the medbay heals adjacent
robots, 2 hit points per turn.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:30.240
You can see that's their quote,
"attack power," because attack

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.840
is a lot like healing.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.560
You know, modern surgery,
you can use scalpel and such.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.359
These are also
considered weapons.

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:39.400
I'm sure you couldn't
bring a scalpel on a plane.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.150
So attack is a really good word
for healing-- a healing unit.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:49.398
And if you don't believe me talk
to any medicine man you know.

00:47:49.398 --> 00:47:53.530
Shields will give
all adjacent robots

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.880
5 shield points per turn.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.930
So if you cluster 8
units around them,

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:00.090
then that'll go ahead and give
40 shield points distributed

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.820
among them, to the extent
that 5 times 8 is 40.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.170
The shields only protect
you from artillery, though.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:12.920
They don't protect you
against other soldiers.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.540
Now, these robots
that are shielded

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.810
will lose 1 shield point
per turn, as it wears off.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.610
But there's no cap on the
amount of shields they can have.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.847
So they can have, I think,
10 to the 8th shields.

00:48:23.847 --> 00:48:26.305
Which is like a lot more than
their total hit points of 40.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.350
Right?

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.090
So that's effectively infinite.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:37.610
The artillery is the one unit
that can shoot at a far range.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.740
It could shoot at a range of 63.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.680
Now we always talk
about squared ranges,

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.950
because that makes it
easier to do comparisons

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:48.610
without having to
take a square root.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.590
Although I guess if we
did give you ranges,

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.690
and not squared ranges, you
could just square it and then

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.898
compare it to the range that
you had just calculated.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.670
this way works really well.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.210
So what I can do is I can
demonstrate for you what that

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.100
looks like by opening
up-- oh my goodness,

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.250
I'm almost out of time.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.810
I can open up this stockpiling--
no, that's not right.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:16.980
I made it in the map
maker program, down here.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.700
Yeah, so this shows
you what 63 looks like.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.957
So if you're here in the middle,
you can see all of these tiles

00:49:24.957 --> 00:49:26.415
but you can't see
the ones outside.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.500
But its site range is only 14.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.220
Every robot has a site range
of 14, As you can see here,

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.970
in this document.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:41.180
So the attack range is
63, the site range is 14.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.670
So, this is one of
those cases where

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:48.480
you'd need scouting units that
would know what to shoot at.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.510
And it's really helpful that you
have this global information.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:54.340
Because you don't
need to post to radio

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.760
to tell the artillery
what to shoot at.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.210
Because he can already
see all of the unit

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.750
that your allies can see.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.990
He can't necessarily
see the enemies,

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.510
unless your guys are nearby.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.590
So, yes, the artillery does
40 damage to the target

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.690
that it specifies, and 20
splash damage to adjacent tiles.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.240
And that does include
friendly fire,

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.420
so you've got to be careful
about where you shoot.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.230
The generator generates
10 resources per turn.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:23.460
And that resource is power.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.790
So that's added on to
your headquarter power.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:27.390
So if you build a
bunch of generators,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.250
you can support more soldiers.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.010
And finally, the
supplier will reduce

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.350
the build time for
soldiers by 5%.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:35.820
And that's multiplicative.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.680
So if you have two
suppliers, then it's

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:45.470
0.95 squared times 10 turns.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:47.830
This year, we give
you the opportunity

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:51.180
of building upgrades as
well, researching upgrades

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.800
at your headquarters.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.170
So your headquarters
is your central unit,

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:58.020
the goal is to defeat
the enemy headquarters.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.560
To do that, you could just
walk your robots on over

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.600
and kill them dead.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.380
It's not required that
you research upgrades

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.520
and built encampments.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.936
And that's one of
the ways that we

00:51:07.936 --> 00:51:10.480
make the competition
somewhat easier to enter,

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.310
easier to get
something that works.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.220
But if you want to
research upgrades,

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.440
to make a strategy
that's tailored

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.240
around a certain approach,
then you can get these.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.320
The future upgrade
reduces your energy decay

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.860
because the way
that you hold power,

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.060
is that you can't just
mass it up indefinitely.

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.190
You get a power income
from your headquarters,

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:37.590
and you spend power to
upkeep your soldiers.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:40.140
But we don't want that--
if you have no soldiers

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.030
and you're just
getting income, we

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.790
don't want that to
go up indefinitely.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.010
So every turn that
gets multiplied

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.260
by a number that reduces it.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.510
So the energy decay,
or the loss is 20%.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.520
But if you research fusion,
the loss is only 1%.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.680
So then you might think
of stockpiling energy

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.740
and then spending it all
at once to get a larger

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.150
burst of robots, which couldn't
be sustained for a long time.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:08.530
But then again, you only
have to win one second.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:12.240
Finally, the-- OK, so then
there's more upgrades.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.320
Vision upgrade extends your
squared vision from 10 to 32.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.050
This should say 14, but
as you know everything

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.960
is always up to date
100 percent of the time.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.490
So here's a demonstration of
what that would look like.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:26.380
Here's 10 and here's 32.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.570
Boom, what a big difference.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.110
That's quite a lot more vision.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:33.770
That's important because
you can defuse any mine

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.160
within your site range if you
have the diffusion ability.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.290
Which is not to be confused
with chemical diffusion, which

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.810
is something else.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.590
Yes, this is for
defusing things,

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.512
and it is spelled correctly.

00:52:45.512 --> 00:52:48.484
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:52:48.484 --> 00:52:50.900
PROFESSOR: So yeah, that extends
your mine defusing range.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.820
That's pretty important,
but keep in mind

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:57.420
that you can still only
defuse one at a time.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.729
So you have to select which
one you're going to defuse.

00:53:00.729 --> 00:53:01.770
And then you defuse that.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.640
Now, it's important
to note that you

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.780
can see where-- I've said that
you see your allied mines.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:12.130
I haven't said that you can
see your neutral mines as well.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.680
But you don't see enemy mines
until one of your robots

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.350
has stepped on it.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:21.990
So that means that you can't--
I don't think you can defuse

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.520
something you can't see.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.630
But actually I don't know,
I'll have to check with that.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.420
Because it may be that
you could just spam

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.620
defuse on terrain
that you don't know.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.370
And that might actually defuse
things that you can't see.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.930
At the same time, that's
not a fantastic strategy,

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:41.870
because defused takes 5 turns.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.410
And during those 5
turns you cannot attack.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:47.440
So that leaves you--
or can you attack?

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.875
I'm thinking maybe
you can attack.

00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:49.666
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:53:49.666 --> 00:53:52.165
PROFESSOR: You know what, you
can't-- it's a very vulnerable

00:53:52.165 --> 00:53:54.260
position, to be
defusing something.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.231
Because you're concentrating
on something else.

00:53:56.231 --> 00:53:57.980
How do you going to
perform as effectively

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.280
on a different task?

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.950
Pickaxe is the tool
that you really

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.050
need if you want to
lay a ton of mines.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.760
Because instead of laying just
one mine, where your robot is--

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.354
I guess I'm going
to have to come up

00:54:09.354 --> 00:54:11.314
with a system for
describing robot--

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:12.480
that's sort of like a robot.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.630
Maybe it's a Chinese character.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.240
So that's a robot,
and ordinarily he

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.740
would lay a mine here,
but if you have pickaxe,

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:22.300
he will lay mines in
all of these positions

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.110
for the same cost of
laying just one mine.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.250
Pretty useful to have.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.130
And it takes the same amount.

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.090
So laying a mine cost
25 rounds, defusing

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:35.219
a mine costs five rounds.

00:54:35.219 --> 00:54:36.260
So you could do the math.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.210
If you have pickaxe,
you could lay them

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.530
as fast as the other
team can defuse them,

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:44.210
provided you can get into an
open space where you can do it.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:48.040
Realistically they might be
able to encroach, and get you

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.630
during that time.

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:52.160
And why do you
want to lay mines?

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.950
Doesn't that slow the game down?

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.800
Doesn't that mean
that things will just

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.640
move to slowly, make it
a boring thing to watch?

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.270
I would say no, because
during that time

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:04.190
you could be researching
the nuclear missile.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:05.500
That's right.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.200
That's right, we
knew that it would

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.830
be interesting to watch
players build nuclear missiles.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.670
If you research that,
you win immediately.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:15.540
So--

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.400
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.000
That's yet another
fun way to win,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.950
and I'm going to show you an
example of somebody attempting

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.020
to win that way.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.380
This will only take as
much time as it took me

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.510
the last time I tried to do it.

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.360
It's under-- golly, you won't
have nearly-- oh, it's right

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.380
here.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.960
It must be so hard to watch
me, because it's like, oh man,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.830
he's looking right at it.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:43.580
Let's see, so let's
put do nothing bot--

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.980
because that's a decent
match for the nuke bot.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:48.680
Where is he?

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.305
Is he not here?

00:55:49.305 --> 00:55:50.390
AUDIENCE: No, he's
in the middle.

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:51.050
PROFESSOR: He's in the middle.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:52.258
Oh, I'm looking right at him.

00:55:52.258 --> 00:55:53.010
All right.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:57.080
All right, well it's by no
means a foregone conclusion

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.070
who wins this match.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.910
This is an old version
of the code where

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:05.670
nuking took 1,000 turns
instead of 400 turns.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:08.670
But that's not to say that
the red team will necessarily

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.120
win on turn 1,000.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.150
Oh wait.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.130
It could only take 400
turns wait a minute.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.550
Oh, that's 1,000 and
this was-- OK yeah, hey!

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.650
It happened.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:18.860
There you go.

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.260
So yeah, the nuclear
missile has-- I mean,

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.986
it's not a very
impressive graphic.

00:56:23.986 --> 00:56:27.904
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:56:27.904 --> 00:56:29.570
PROFESSOR: It's
technically the same one

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.370
we use for every
other explosion.

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:33.710
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:37.710
PROFESSOR: But I think what
we'll do is for the finals,

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.510
we've got a new
match visualizer.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.160
So this was an old
version of the code,

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.618
because of course I wouldn't
show you something up to date.

00:56:44.618 --> 00:56:46.935
That would be that help
you instead of hinder you.

00:56:46.935 --> 00:56:49.490
And what we're trying to do
is train you to be amazing.

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.961
And it's working, I swear.

00:56:51.961 --> 00:56:54.210
So what I'll do is I'll show
this version of it, which

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.327
is great, because it shows
the thing researching.

00:56:56.327 --> 00:56:58.160
All right, well later
versions of the client

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.535
that you're going
to receive will

00:56:59.535 --> 00:57:02.360
show what things are researching
in the client window.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.914
And I think it really would
not be in an excessive--

00:57:05.914 --> 00:57:07.580
the pizza should be
arriving any moment,

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.413
so I know that the
gurgling of your stomachs

00:57:09.413 --> 00:57:14.780
is totally reasonable and
will be resolved imminently.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.610
If I run this version,
then I think-- let's see,

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:21.574
is there-- so let's put do
nothing against the nuke guy.

00:57:21.574 --> 00:57:22.740
Is the nuke guy still there?

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.060
He is, OK.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.360
So this version of
the map viewer shows

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.830
researches that are going on.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:28.330
Yeah.

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:31.870
And you can see he's researching
pickaxe, diffusion, sight

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:34.770
range, the fusion
thing that reduces

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:35.960
the amount of energy loss.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.710
He's researching everything.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:39.870
And whereas the other do
nothing guy-- you know,

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.740
you could describe
him as a pacifist.

00:57:45.945 --> 00:57:48.820
The philosophy that
he is developing,

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.220
using three bytecodes per
round, may change the world.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:58:00.290
So I see no reason to hate
on his choice of vocation.

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:02.820
I would definitely not--
yeah, no, definitely.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.340
OK.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.800
So you can see here that
nuke is researching.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.540
So in a tournament
scenario we could all

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.252
start getting excited
and going ohhhhh!

00:58:11.252 --> 00:58:12.210
What's going to happen?

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.510
Is it going to be close?

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.957
And that sort of thing.

00:58:14.957 --> 00:58:16.540
I mean of course at
the end it's going

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.290
to be a bit of an
anti-climax because it's

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.390
going to show a
little puff ball,

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:23.640
like somebody made
popcorn on one tile.

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.020
But we'll be able to overcome
that because we can just

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.115
switch to YouTube
and show a clip

00:58:30.115 --> 00:58:33.640
of some giant nuclear test.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.020
All right, that's all
I have for you now.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.850
I mean to say that
we're going to show

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.130
you a whole bunch of things.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.680
You can get up and go,
I know a lot of you

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:47.460
have appointments with very
attractive young women and men.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.700
And that's totally OK.

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.760
But I recommend that you
stick around, eat some pizza,

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.770
hear about how to
set up Battlecode.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:59:02.030
And know that we will have
our developer testing code up.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.550
The team name, here on
the Battlecode website.

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:07.900
You can see here, team list.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:12.164
We just made a team that you can
use to test your code against.

00:59:12.164 --> 00:59:13.455
That's down here at the bottom.

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:21.850
It's test, somewhere.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.300
Yeah, Teh Devs
Test, there you go.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.307
Did you guys make this many
teams in the last 2 seconds?

00:59:26.307 --> 00:59:26.890
You must have.

00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:29.110
You know, it's
important to multitask.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.490
Yeah, so you can
upload your player

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:35.860
and test it against
Teh Devs test player.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.460
And that'll be
available all the time,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.060
and that's probably
sort of your first step

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.060
on your road to success.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:45.370
Thank you very much for coming,
and if you have any questions

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:49.110
you can come to us after.

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.660
[APPLAUSE]

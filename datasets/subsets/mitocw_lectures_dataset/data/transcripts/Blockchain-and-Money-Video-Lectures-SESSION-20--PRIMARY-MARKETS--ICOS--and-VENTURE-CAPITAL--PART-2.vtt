00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:25.080
GARY GENSLER: We're going
to turn back to ICOs

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.480
and spend a little bit
more time on initial coin

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.820
offerings in the markets and
the regulation of initial coin

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.920
offerings today.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.580
But before I did
that, I was going

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.045
to talk about one short
announcement that happened.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:45.300
In the US, we've talked
about how fiat currencies are

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.508
accepted for taxes.

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:48.336
AUDIENCE: Ohio!

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:50.913
GARY GENSLER: Ohio.

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:52.830
James, what do you want
to tell me about Ohio?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.977
AUDIENCE: They're taking
Bitcoin for taxes, right?

00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:55.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.143
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.390
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.735
What's that?

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.360
So do you want to
say a little bit more

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.753
about it, Hugo, or Ross?

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:02.545
AUDIENCE: Go ahead.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:03.760
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.170
Yeah, so they're accepting
Bitcoin for taxes

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.320
through BitPay, which
means that it's instantly

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.000
transferred into fiat.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.130
But still, that's
a pretty big thing.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.630
You know?

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.202
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, so the state
of Ohio, I guess it was the--

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:19.035
AUDIENCE: Treasurer.

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:20.760
GARY GENSLER: --treasurer.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.050
Tom, you're shaking your head.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.227
AUDIENCE: Oh, as an Ohioan,
just Ohio today breaks my heart,

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.560
not related to this-- unrelated.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.652
GARY GENSLER: So Ohio
breaks your heart

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.485
because they're accepting
Bitcoin for taxes?

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:32.318
AUDIENCE: Unrelated.

00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:34.730
GARY GENSLER: Unrelated.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.670
Do you want to share
for the class, or?

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.045
AUDIENCE: I'll let [INAUDIBLE]
and his next four years

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:40.350
of policy speak for itself.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.182
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:42.320
GARY GENSLER: Oh, I see.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.960
So the state of
Ohio has announced,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
the state treasurer-- is this
an elected office, the state

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.380
treasurer?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.810
So he saw that it would be good
for Ohio, for the economics

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.850
and for the job creation
in Ohio, and maybe

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.170
for his politics,
to move forward

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.450
and say the state of Ohio
would accept Bitcoin for taxes.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.550
It's the only US jurisdiction
that I know that has done that.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.730
Now, you can think
of them as a vendor,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.710
like they're saying
they will take it.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.180
And they've arranged it, as
Hugo said, through BitPay.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.010
BitPay is an application
where, whether you're Starbucks

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.680
or the state of Ohio, you can
take a cryptocurrency like

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.260
Bitcoin, and they will
take that Bitcoin,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.290
sell it quickly on an
exchange, take some price risk-

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.800
BitPay takes a little
bit of price risk--

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.920
and for a 1% fee, give
you fiat currency.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.430
Now, it's 1% and
whatever exchange rate,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.400
because I don't know how
much VIG, or margin, is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.730
in the exchange
rate transaction.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.560
But their stated fee is 1%.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.123
Hugo?

00:02:56.123 --> 00:02:58.290
AUDIENCE: I think the big
question is whether or not

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.180
that's a taxable event, too.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.530
GARY GENSLER: Is a
taxable event for who?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.800
AUDIENCE: For the person who's
paying their taxes in Bitcoin,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.720
if any transaction from Bitcoin
to fiat is a taxable event.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.720
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.450
So Hugo's raised the
question, is the sale

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.220
of the Bitcoin to fiat--

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.860
because the fiat is,
in essence, being

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.590
used to pay the
state of Ohio taxes--

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.600
is the sale of that
Bitcoin a taxable event?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.492
And I think somebody
in the class will know.

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:27.075
It's knowable.

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:30.310
AUDIENCE: If you sold Bitcoin
to acquire fiat, it would be.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.350
But if you use fiat
to acquire Bitcoin,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.210
which I think the
big application here

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.020
is the marijuana
industry in Ohio,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.970
if they're not able to back the
bank-- if they are acquiring

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.718
Bitcoins and then paying
them to the government,

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.260
I think they don't
have to pay taxes.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.310
GARY GENSLER: What if you
bought Bitcoin at $3,700,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.200
and the day that you
sent in your taxes

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.562
it's valued at $3,800 bitcoin?

00:03:55.562 --> 00:03:56.700
AUDIENCE: Congratulations.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.330
AUDIENCE: You would pay
taxes on the profit.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.980
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.680
So at least here in the US--

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.640
the IRS has spoken to this--
if you acquire Bitcoin

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.090
and then you use the
Bitcoin in commerce,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.870
if you're using it to fulfill
an obligation, in this case

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.220
a debt to the Ohio government,
and if it moved from $3,700

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.032
to $3,800, you would, yes.

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:23.490
You would have a
short-term capital

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.990
gains on the $100 difference.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.770
Whether everybody will
comply and report properly

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.580
is another thing.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.190
But that is certainly my
reading of US law at this time.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.530
Ross?

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.530
AUDIENCE: This rate--

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.340
I saw this, and I looked
up a couple of things--

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.840
it strikes me it
would be taxable

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.990
given what you've said
about the US thing.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.240
And it really is just
changing it for fiat.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.190
It's just the structure, really.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.280
But what might make it
seem more interesting

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.190
or gain a little
traction is if, Ohio,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.290
if they have a state income
tax, agreed not to tax the gain.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.300
Ohio could agree not to do it.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.370
You split the pay
on the federal side.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.038
But then they could make it
more like a real transaction

00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:15.080
if you're paying Bitcoin.

00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:18.890
GARY GENSLER: And
how many of you

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.964
are from Ohio here
other than Tom?

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:24.490
Tom, as an Ohioan,
would you want

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.930
them to not charge the taxes?

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.411
You're one voter, I know.

00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.828
AUDIENCE: So
there's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:32.683
GARY GENSLER: Oh, [LAUGHS] OK.

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:34.600
AUDIENCE: So they charge
the state income tax.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.080
But I don't know if they charge
a state capital gains tax.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.497
AUDIENCE: But
that's the question.

00:05:38.497 --> 00:05:41.115
I'm just saying that's how they
could make it more real than--

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:41.990
like Hugo was saying.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.102
It's not real right now.

00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:45.560
We're just converting it to
dollars and taking the dollars.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.500
GARY GENSLER: They did,
in this announcement--

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.830
if you read the fine print as
I was want to do because I was

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.230
fascinated by this--

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.540
for the first three
months of the program,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.520
Ohio negotiated with BitPay
that BitPay would charge a 0%

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.380
fee for the first three months.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.200
But this was BitPay foregoing--

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.035
it appears that that was their
bonus to the state of Ohio--

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:15.100
0% fee for three
months, again, not

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.560
knowing exactly what
exchange rate you're getting

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.590
and so forth.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.565
And you think that it would
be the cannabis industry?

00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:28.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so Ohio passed
a state constitutional amendment

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.588
two years ago.

00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:31.630
GARY GENSLER: We're talking
about Ohio that's now

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.370
accepting Bitcoin for taxes.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.155
And Tom is our
resident Ohio expert.

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:38.030
AUDIENCE: I guess so.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.570
So yeah, Ohio will
legalize-- the state voters

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.056
passed an amendment to allow
marijuana legalization.

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:49.840
It's subject to,
I think, some time

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.600
delay or regulatory approval.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.150
But the expectation is
it will be approved.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.650
And the marijuana
industry is still

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.280
restricted from accessing
the federal banking system.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.420
So an alternate way
for them to avoid

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.250
carrying large sums of cash--

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.840
GARY GENSLER: Is carry the
value in cryptocurrency.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.270
And do you think that's what
motivated the Ohio State

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.990
Treasurer?

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.605
I see.

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:15.780
Shawn?

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.100
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.740
So if that's the
case, and if I may--

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.500
well, look, I don't
know of capital gains,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.420
but if we can cut losses on
Bitcoin, does that part of loss

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.980
get carried forward
that allows you

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.340
to upset some of your income?

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.650
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
it's a capital loss,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.720
just as if you
bought Apple stock

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.970
and had a loss on Apple stock.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.590
AUDIENCE: So this cannot be
carried forward to offset

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.180
the future--

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:43.900
GARY GENSLER: Under US law--

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.150
I can't speak to other
jurisdictions' tax--

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.250
but you can apply
losses against gains.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.250
And to the extent you have
greater losses than gains,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.765
you can actually take
some of those losses

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:57.640
against your income--

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.180
I don't remember the limit any
longer; it's 3,000 US dollars--

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.710
and then, otherwise,
carry it forward.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:12.250
So for most citizens, they
would just take that loss.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.640
If you had greater than that,
you would carry it forward.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.210
Any other thoughts on Ohio?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.213
I mean--

00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:20.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm
just wondering, sort

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.830
of philosophically,
Ohio isn't actually

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.410
carrying the price for this.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.490
But given they're converting
it to fiat instantaneously,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.870
philosophically are
they really accepting

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.179
Bitcoin as payment for taxes?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.700
Or is it just a
marketing gimmick?

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.840
GARY GENSLER: I don't know.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.539
I mean, any other views on that?

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.280
So the question
is, is Ohio really

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.550
taking cryptocurrencies,
Bitcoin,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.916
or is it just marketing?

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:50.487
AUDIENCE: I think it's marketing
because if you have BitPay,

00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:52.320
the whole point of
BitPay is turning it back

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.300
into fiat, which is why I think
they should pay taxes on it.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.850
If the state of Ohio had
a wallet with Bitcoin

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.120
and they would accept those
bitcoins into their wallet

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.450
and hold those proceedings
in their wallet,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.310
then they would be formally
accepting Bitcoin for taxes.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:17.010
And you will not need to pay
taxes on that transaction.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.830
GARY GENSLER: But I
would raise the question,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.640
with all respect,
what's the relevance?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.400
Why does it matter
to a taxpayer in Ohio

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.730
if this facilitates
my paying my taxes,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.840
whether it's in the cannabis
trade or some other trade?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.350
They're facilitating another
means of paying my taxes,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.660
fulfilling my
obligation to society.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.630
So my response to
that would be in how

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.370
we define what a currency is.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.900
And one of those criteria is,
are they accepted to pay taxes?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.807
I think it's relevant
to that distinction.

00:09:51.807 --> 00:09:53.150
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.560
Tom, do you want to defend
your fellow Ohioans?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.910
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.160
I mean, I think it's relevant.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
I mean, the Ohio State
Treasurer doesn't

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.138
take pork bellies or cotton or
even corn as paying for taxes.

00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:09.430
I don't know if they take gold.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.610
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.150
To the best of my knowledge, no.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so even for
the short-term transfer,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.010
I think it's relevant.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.680
GARY GENSLER: So it's
a bit of a hybrid,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.950
I guess, is what Tom's saying.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.925
Ross?

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.280
AUDIENCE: There's a real
question about whether they

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.490
could take it
directly for taxes,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.030
because under the Constitution,
the states cannot make anything

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.750
legal tender.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.590
Only the federal government
can make that determination.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.050
Only the federal government
can establish legal tender, not

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.620
the states, other than gold.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.170
So it would actually
be a question

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.275
about whether Ohio could--

00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:51.430
who would object is
another question.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.650
But it's an issue.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.740
What they're doing is
marketing, I think.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.190
But they could, for example--

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.520
GARY GENSLER: Though
I'm not studied

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:06.880
in the law of legal tender,
I could see a case that says,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.830
this is not making
it legal tender.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.710
This is just saying
you can pay your taxes

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.266
in another form of property.

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:15.625
AUDIENCE: That's the question.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:16.583
GARY GENSLER: You know?

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.880
Does that make it legal tender?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.380
No.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.160
It just makes it that we,
the government of Ohio,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.380
will accept it for taxes.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.350
But it doesn't mean that we
are saying that Starbucks has

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.400
to take it for a cup of coffee.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.010
AUDIENCE: I also
see it as a gateway

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.490
as taking it in a few years,
having their own wallet.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.700
So testing it out, see how
many people actually use it.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.200
And if they want
to eventually avoid

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.870
the fees of the
processing service,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.050
they could eventually
rule that out of it.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.490
If they set it is
a precedent now,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.770
and whether or not they're
converting it immediately,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.250
doesn't really have an
effect as to whether it

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.990
sets a precedent
for future years

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.340
to actually use it as legal--

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.173
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:58.380
AUDIENCE: --tender,
as their own wallet,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.903
as [INAUDIBLE] was saying.

00:12:00.903 --> 00:12:03.070
GARY GENSLER: And they might
just be testing it out.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.570
James?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.612
AUDIENCE: I guess, reverting to
Ross's point, in legal tender,

00:12:06.612 --> 00:12:07.570
the money is different.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.260
Right?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.720
So the criteria here,
where you're talking money,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.970
you could pay taxes,
which, in this case,

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.770
I think this is verging
on to the hybrid situation

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.720
where it's not a cow.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.920
It's not some corn.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.550
But it certainly can pay
the taxes via [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.360
So they kind of make it
more and more like money.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.630
Where about this legal
tender, that's money,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.670
[? well, ?] [? 2.0. ?]

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.670
AUDIENCE: I think it's--

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.860
AUDIENCE: --a question
of whether you

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.965
can get to a hybrid using bits.

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:35.998
I agree with that.

00:12:35.998 --> 00:12:36.790
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.140
And they're testing it out.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.000
And maybe this state
treasurer feels

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.560
that it's good for
his politics, it

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.610
will appeal to some
portion of the electorate,

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.710
whether it's
millennials, whether it's

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.390
Bitcoin maximalist, whether
it's the cannabis trade.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.358
Or maybe he just
looks more tech savvy,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.900
that they can put
out an announcement

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.485
saying we are the only
state in the land.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:08.410
The website says that they're
promoting it to lower fees.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.910
Now, I don't know
how many people

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.080
would pay their taxes in Ohio
using the credit card rails.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.610
But literally on
the website, they

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.380
talk about, well, this has lower
fees than the 2 and 1/2% or 3%

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.640
you get charged on
your credit cards.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.780
But I think that that would
only be a very small portion

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.640
of taxpayers.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.830
And they're accepting
it for sales tax.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.650
They're accepting it
for all forms of tax.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.670
It's not just income tax.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:41.470
So it's all the small
transactional taxes as well as

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.210
income tax and real estate tax.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.260
So it's just an
interesting thing.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:48.760
Jake?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.552
AUDIENCE: What's the
actual benefit for it,

00:13:50.552 --> 00:13:53.020
because can't they just go
sell the Bitcoin on the market

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.955
and pay the taxes in cash?

00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:56.495
GARY GENSLER: So benefit for?

00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:57.620
AUDIENCE: For the taxpayer.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.190
GARY GENSLER: For the taxpayer?

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.190
This is a good question.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.740
What's the benefit
for the taxpayer?

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.860
It's the same
question of, what's

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.360
the benefit for any consumer if
I want to use Bitcoin, maybe,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.430
to buy a Starbucks?

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:18.880
So any vendor could say,
we'll accept Bitcoin here.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.140
The benefit for the
consumer or taxpayer

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.820
is if they find it
more convenient,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.390
if it's lower fees, if this
is where they're storing

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.070
their value rather than fiat.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.430
Not many people are.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.960
But that would be--

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.710
and maybe as Tom
pointed out, that there

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.460
is a specific
idiosyncratic thing in Ohio

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.050
that they've just moved forward.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.055
And they legalized the
marijuana trade in Ohio?

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.930
AUDIENCE: I don't think
it's fully legalized.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.745
It's been authorized
to be legalized.

00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.573
But I don't think that they--

00:14:53.573 --> 00:14:55.240
GARY GENSLER: So
they're in the process.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.700
And Tom has a theory
that maybe there's

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.350
some that can't access the
banking system, the fiat.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.720
In essence, they're
off fiat rails.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.820
So here's, at least,
Tom's theory of the case.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.630
So those might be some of the--

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.360
anyway.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.510
So what else happened
in the last week,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.870
by the way, since
we came together?

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.885
Anything else in
the crypto space?

00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:26.330
AUDIENCE: 30% drop in Bitcoin.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.150
GARY GENSLER: 30% drop.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.630
I haven't checked
recently, but yeah.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.700
Do you have any theories
on that before we

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.598
go to crypto exchanges
and ICOs and everything?

00:15:39.598 --> 00:15:41.074
AUDIENCE: Not that come up.

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:41.782
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:15:41.782 --> 00:15:43.790
No theories.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.800
Oh, well, Brotish we
haven't heard from Brotish.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.250
You have a theory
as to the 30% drop

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.450
since we were last together?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.150
AUDIENCE: I have
a different point

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.550
about what happened recently.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.890
We saw the news
article [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.635
postponing the launch
of the Bitcoin future

00:15:57.635 --> 00:15:59.885
to February, which was
supposed to happen in November.

00:15:59.885 --> 00:16:02.302
GARY GENSLER: Do you think
that was because they were here

00:16:02.302 --> 00:16:03.670
to talk with us?

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.045
I mean, your
questions were good.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.980
Do you have any views on--

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.724
Sean, we'll come
back to the back.

00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:14.420
AUDIENCE: Because
of the hard fork,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.890
there was a hard fork that
happened last Saturday,

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.635
a week ago, on Bitcoin Cash.

00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:23.150
And then people, kind of, caused
the skepticism in the market

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.900
to say which is going to be
the majority of the consensus

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.990
for the currency.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.590
GARY GENSLER: So there was
a hard fork in Bitcoin Cash,

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.790
that Bitcoin Cash split
into, yet, Bitcoin Cash.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.157
And is it now settled
as Bitcoin SV?

00:16:41.157 --> 00:16:42.935
S-- what's that?

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.060
AUDIENCE: Satoshi's Vision.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.370
GARY GENSLER: Satoshi's
Vision, so SV.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.370
I couldn't make this stuff up.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.380
But that hard fork
was, timing wise,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.597
right at the center of
a break in the markets.

00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:07.430
And so there's some
that have written, well,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.280
is that the reason?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.440
I've been around
markets long enough

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.930
to think that might
be a news event.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.930
But I don't think that
was the reason there

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.190
was such a softness in demand,
that a news event like that

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:28.085
comes along, and then the market
breaks and finds no support,

00:17:28.085 --> 00:17:32.230
and it drops from,
what was it around,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.950
$6,300 all the way through
to $3,700 or $3,800?

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.700
I don't know where
it's trading right now.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.075
But it's somewhere
in that range.

00:17:40.075 --> 00:17:41.570
AUDIENCE: $3,714.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.570
GARY GENSLER: I'm sorry.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.560
AUDIENCE: $3,714.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.360
GARY GENSLER: The
Ohioan has spoken--

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.000
$3,714.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.710
So that type of not
finding a price support,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.150
there's other reasons,
I would think,

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.280
which really goes back to the
heart and soul of valuation.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.780
Yes.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.155
AUDIENCE: What about, we were
talking about tax stability

00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:05.690
earlier.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.588
It is approaching December,
so tax-loss selling for people

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:10.880
in taxable [? jurisdictions. ?]

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.030
GARY GENSLER: So maybe
tax-loss selling.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.905
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? for a ?]

00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:16.940
company and news about
Visa and MasterCard

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.390
[INAUDIBLE] anything
related to cryptocurrencies

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.600
and initial coin offering,
so any transaction related

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.317
to them.

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:27.150
So there was something
in the news about it.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.700
GARY GENSLER:
There is also news,

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.190
which we're going to review
today, that the Securities

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.920
and Exchange Commission
took two additional actions

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.480
in the initial coin
offering space.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.600
But these actions were
a little different

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.760
than the past actions.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.000
So they've already taken about
a dozen enforcement actions,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.410
or settlements, or orders,
in the initial coin offering

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:49.910
space.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.070
But these two, Paragon and--

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.830
AUDIENCE: Airfox.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:19:00.590
GARY GENSLER: --Airfox were
different in that, one, they

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:07.400
weren't surrounded by
obvious scam or fraud.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.110
I'm not going to speak
to their motivations.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.910
But they were more traditional,
$12, $15, $18 million

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.140
raised in each of
them, situations.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.330
Two, they're about a year old.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.570
And here they are finally
coming to a settlement

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.650
where the entrepreneurs, the
venture capitalists behind it,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.210
said, all right, we get it.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.170
We're going to come
into compliance.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.480
We're going to do an
offering statement.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.810
We're going to put out the
full and fair information

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.900
about this.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:45.560
But also, we're going to be
willing to give back money

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.060
to people who were--

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.300
so they're not
fighting in a court.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.360
Some have gone into
court against the SEC.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.820
But here, also, the other
thing was the first time

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.380
they paid penalties,
I think they

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.890
were modest, relatively modest--
quarter million dollars,

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.330
if I saw.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.290
But that also happened
in the midst of this.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.070
The SEC for the first time
actually assessed penalties,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.500
had settlements.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.980
They were also not
the, sort of, clear,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.200
obvious scam and fraud cases.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.570
They were simply, hey,
you didn't register,

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.400
and you were
supposed to register.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.690
You're, in essence, an
illegal securities offering.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:30.040
But now, come into compliance,
pay a penalty, move forward,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.610
as well.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.400
So a lot going on.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.010
So today, we already did
Ohio, which was more fun

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.270
than the rest of this stuff.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.820
We're going to talk a little
bit about the Howey Test

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.100
again, which we talked
about about a month ago.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.890
But I wanted to bring it
back into the discussion

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.860
about initial coin offerings.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.110
We're going to talk a little
bit about some realities.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.090
Ernst & Young put
out a recent report

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.380
that wasn't in your readings.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.640
It just came out last week.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.680
But I want to review some of the
findings that Ernst & Young did

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.780
on, what they call,
the class of 2017.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.920
They look at the top
140 ICOs from 2017,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.180
and where are they as of the
end of September of this year,

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.080
not even speaking about the
last six or eight weeks.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.600
Some SEC enforcement
actions I want

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.660
to walk through just to give
you a flavor for, at least,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.560
this country's approach
to initial coin offerings,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.890
how you can actually
comply with securities law.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.880
I promise you that I'm not
going to go deep diving.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.990
But I want to give you a
little bit of a flavor for,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.780
if you were to be involved
in an initial coin offering,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.070
how to do it in a compliant way.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.920
And some personal thoughts
on the path forward

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.310
in ICO [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.770
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.570
The study questions,
we'll get to.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:22:00.160
But I just want to ask the
class the middle question,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.730
which is the easiest,
or maybe the hardest.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.440
Why is this market so rife with
scams and fraud, whether it's

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.090
Christian Catalini's
work that said

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.560
25% of the market or
the smaller survey

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.390
status group that was part of
today's readings, up to 80%?

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.530
Why do you think this
market has so many scams?

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.990
Aline what do you--

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.292
AUDIENCE: It's so easy to con.

00:22:25.292 --> 00:22:26.470
GARY GENSLER: What's easy?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.857
The question's easy, or
scamming the market's easy?

00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:30.440
AUDIENCE: It's so
easy to scam people.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.690
Like, why wouldn't you do it?

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.680
It's so damn easy.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680
GARY GENSLER: I'm sorry.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.210
The first part I got.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.220
Remember we're on video.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:40.720
All right.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.440
AUDIENCE: It's a
rhetorical question.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.148
GARY GENSLER: It's a
rhetorical question.

00:22:44.148 --> 00:22:45.700
It's so easy.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.440
And thus, it's easy
for bad actors.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.095
Jihee.

00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:51.140
AUDIENCE: I thought there
were two main reasons.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.080
One is because it's
such a new thing,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.410
there is lack of the
regulatory environment

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.460
that happens with the IPO and
other ways of raising funds.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.260
And I think the second one
is it's, as Alin pointed out,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.770
I think it's very easy to
just go say, I'm going to do

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.490
ICO when there is only an idea.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.540
So I think that's why a lot
of investors or consumers

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.146
just fall into these
scams and fraud.

00:23:19.146 --> 00:23:22.570
AUDIENCE: And I mean,
the fact that you're just

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.560
publishing a white paper, that
no one actually is interacting

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.158
with you unless it's on a
blog or something like that,

00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:30.700
they're publishing
a white paper that

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.790
could have this grandiose
idea, and then all of a sudden

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.660
they just run.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.050
And there's really nothing
stopping them from doing that.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.215
So it's just difficult.

00:23:40.215 --> 00:23:42.700
GARY GENSLER: So
I've heard it's easy.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.220
It's not yet in a
regulatory space.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.650
It's at a distance.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.033
It's just the publishing
of a white paper.

00:23:51.033 --> 00:23:53.450
AUDIENCE: And there's simply
demand because of immediate--

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.210
GARY GENSLER: So demand.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's
just a lot of demand.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.240
With the media around Bitcoin
going up towards $20,000

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.960
last year, there's demand to
get into the bottom of one

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.210
of these ICOs to hope to get
the same kind of returns.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.060
GARY GENSLER: So there is
tremendous demand and, related

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:14.410
to demand, fear of missing
out, so whether it's greed--

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.170
the animal spirits, the
human spirits of market's

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.355
around fear and greed.

00:24:18.355 --> 00:24:22.270
So the greed of participating
or the fear of missing out

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:28.540
was certainly part of
late 2017 and into 2018.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.040
Kelly?

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.620
AUDIENCE: We could
talk a little bit more

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.120
about what Jihee
said about the lack

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.190
of a regulatory environment.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.060
That sort of leads to--
because a lot of these ICOs

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.810
are not in compliance
with securities acts

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.220
and regulations that allows
them to sort of skirmish

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.680
around investor protection.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.790
So investors, they're
not necessarily

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.450
privy to material information
about the financing

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.240
and what they might
reasonably expect as a return.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.920
So it kind of--

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.530
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.142
AUDIENCE: They're just taking
advantage of it a little bit.

00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:01.450
GARY GENSLER: I agree,
but I think the court--

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.260
Kelly is touching
on one other thing.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:03.760
Guillermo.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.005
AUDIENCE: I had one
question on this.

00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:07.960
The scams are
defined as a company

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.970
that you can no
longer reach or see

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.440
if they came out with a product.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.420
But I was wondering,
given that this

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.610
is a very early-stage
venture, how much, really,

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.570
do people maliciously
run away with the money,

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.250
or just tried
something and failed?

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.917
Do they just raise money,
and because they did it

00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:28.750
with a PowerPoint, they
realized this is not

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.340
going to be a good
business case,

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.890
and they just abandon
it, not as a scam

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.490
but as a new
venture that failed?

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.270
GARY GENSLER: I think Guillermo
raises the right question.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.600
It's why one study says it's
5% to 25% scams or frauds,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.640
and another study says 80%.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.850
It's what's in the definition.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:53.790
A good-faith actor could
say this is easy money.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.590
A good-faith actor could
say this is cheap money.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.140
I can raise money
fast just on the backs

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:05.530
of a white paper in the middle
of a bull market, maybe even

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.790
a bubble, and then find
out three months later

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.690
that their idea
doesn't work out.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.970
And I accept that
there are probably

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.450
a lot of good-faith actors
that raised tens of millions

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.010
of dollars.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.900
And I wouldn't necessarily
personally call that a scam.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.990
But nonetheless, somebody
else might call that a scam.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:35.560
So Telegram raised $1.7 billion
in February of this year.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.140
I don't know-- how
many people have ever

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.395
read the white paper, I mean,
not that it was ever assigned?

00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:43.270
All right, all right.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.490
So all right, I've
read the white paper.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.650
I couldn't figure
out in February

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.690
when they raised the
money what they were going

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.880
to use that $1.7 billion for.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.420
Now, it's a
remarkable technology.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.790
And they have, I think,
somewhere around 200 million

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.710
users in their
non-blockchain use.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.080
And so they were able
to raise a lot of money

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.990
with a lot of fancy words.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.210
But they still
haven't gone live.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:17.800
They haven't taken the $1.7
billion and created a network.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.800
Filecoin seemed
to be a good-faith

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.060
concept about using
a token to motivate

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.320
the exchange of file storage.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.320
Assume for a moment
it's good-faith actors.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.050
They raised the money
in October of 2017.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.410
It's 13 months later.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.730
They still do not
have a live network.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.430
And the latest
announcement says it

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:50.470
will come either in the first
or second quarter of 2019.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.610
Some people might
call that a scam.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.500
I wouldn't.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.400
But so I think you're right.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.600
There's a range of activity.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.300
But there's one
other thing about why

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.800
I think this has been an easy
place for scams and frauds.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.580
And it's the technical
nature of it, as well.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.575
Like, I hope at the end
of this class, whatever

00:28:12.575 --> 00:28:14.450
you think of the lectures,
whatever you think

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.825
of the assignments,
you come away

00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:19.520
with some critical reasoning
skills, that the 80 or so

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.940
of you who have been on
this journey together

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.530
will leave and say,
all right, I get it.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.120
But for most, for the
hundreds of thousands

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.030
or even millions of
people that have invested,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.300
there's a lot of technical--

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.560
whether it's hash functions
or digital signatures.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.600
And so I think it's
easier to scam the public

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.300
when it's shrouded in jargon.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.860
And so maybe it's a
lesson for all of us

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.130
to always be careful
about our own investments

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.620
when something is
shrouded in jargon.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.620
And it doesn't have to
be cryptographic jargon.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.900
It could be other types
of jargon, as well.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.840
I think that's also
one of the reasons

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.980
why it's been easier
to scam and fleece

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.400
the public in the midst
of a bubble, in the midst

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.040
of a nonregulated
space, in the midst of,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.420
just throw a white paper up.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.920
Jake?

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.635
AUDIENCE: It's also the
nature of it just being,

00:29:21.635 --> 00:29:23.320
we're investing in
such an early stage.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.260
So plenty of tech that
ends up IPOing and has

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.850
public investors when it's early
on, it's only VCs investing.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.210
And they understand the tech.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.503
But you don't have regular
consumer retail investors

00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:37.670
actually putting money into
those really early-stage

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.770
companies, where
with ICOs, we're

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.050
investing at the white paper.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.490
So regardless of
whether it's blockchain

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.500
or a robotics
company or whatever,

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.056
it is very confusing
that early on.

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:48.950
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.540
So it's also very
early-stage investing,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.970
which is a good point.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.730
So I'm going to skip
over the reading.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.500
So investor protection.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.470
I found in a conference in
Paris, an OECD conference--

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.520
we got into a debate.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.230
And there were regulators--

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.760
I was not a regulator
at the time;

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.500
this was earlier this year--

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.450
regulators from 30
or 40 countries.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.310
And we got in a
debate of, what's

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.920
the difference between investor
protection and consumer

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.240
protection?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.160
And so these are
just some thoughts.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.390
But investor protection, which
has been the hallmark of the US

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.050
markets that's in the 1930s,
and in other jurisdictions,

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.540
other decades it's
been adopted, I

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.610
think is part of why the US
capital markets were really

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.240
at the forefront of this
incredible economy for 70

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.770
or 80 years here in the US.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.720
And it's helped other
economies subsequently.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.970
But it's four big things.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.450
Investors do take risk.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.930
But they get full and fair
disclosure from an issuer.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.800
And there's a concept that
there's asymmetric knowledge,

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.580
that an issuer has a
bunch of information

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.890
and an investor does not.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.500
Through the laws
of the land, can we

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.750
balance that a little bit?

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.020
Investors still have every
opportunity to take risk.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.680
But can we address the
asymmetry of information?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:18.540
And that's really a core
part of investor protection,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.540
a little bit different
than consumer protection.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.960
You still want to be protected
that a crib that you buy

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.810
is not going to hurt your
child or that the clothing you

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.840
put on an infant isn't
instantly flammable.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.000
Those are important
consumer protections.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.420
And often, we protect
them in the laws, as well.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.630
But information asymmetry
and the difference

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.630
between information between an
issuer, somebody raising money,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.550
and an investor is
something we try

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.890
to embed in securities
laws around the globe.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.680
Two is the concept
of sales practices.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.740
Various fraud and sales
practices are prohibited.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.720
Sometimes you hear this
around securities laws

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.510
about the marketing
information, what information

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.120
you need to provide.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.090
So the first and
second are principles

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.390
that go into why there's
information statements.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.990
Or securities offerings come
with all that boilerplate,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.920
and sometimes you might
say it's too much.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.820
But all of that is to address
information asymmetries

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.040
and try to lessen
or make it harder

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.220
to have fraud and
deceptive practices.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.810
Then we have something called
secondary markets, where

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.110
buyers and sellers meet, like
on the New York Stock Exchange

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:39.150
or on a crypto exchange,
and the concept being,

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.850
can we promote market integrity?

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.990
Can we promote those markets
either through transparency--

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.640
transparency is really being
able to see what buy orders

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.525
and sell orders--

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.920
what's the price that
people are willing to pay?

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.560
What's the amount they're
willing to buy or sell?

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.800
So pre-trade
transparency says, I'm

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.430
going to share in
the marketplace,

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.420
that there's not somebody
over here, some high frequency

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.150
traders, that get
transparency, but retail public

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.180
does not get transparency.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.670
It brings it into one market.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.430
And some rules
against manipulation.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.210
Now one person's manipulation's
another person's market

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.380
practice.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.950
I respect that, too, just
like the word "scam."

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.800
But there's traditional
things about manipulation

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.460
that have come to
be, no, we should

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.430
forbid certain practices.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.400
Front-running is one,
where a customer gives you

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.280
a sell order, and you say,
well, the customers sell order,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.320
good, I'll sell in
front of them because I

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.920
know that when they
sell, it's going

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.135
to be market pressure, either
up pressure with a buy order

00:33:54.135 --> 00:33:57.640
or down pressure
with a sell order.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:02.940
So one is address asymmetries
through information.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.600
Prohibit or limit fraud and
deceptive sales practices

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.010
and marketing--

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.929
lying, sort of.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.840
Promote the integrity
of the secondary markets

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.060
through, first,
price transparency

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.690
and, secondly, antimanipulation.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.540
And then, lastly, recognizing
that all financial markets

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.219
have conflicts.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.739
And we are not going
to repeal conflicts.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.380
Anytime any one of
you goes to a broker,

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.690
that broker does
want you to transact

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.210
so that they earn more money.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.330
But by the way, when you
sit down at a restaurant

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.100
and they ask you if you want
a drink before you order,

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.969
there is a bit of
a conflict, too.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.489
They want you to buy the
drink because your tip

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:50.790
amount is a percent of your
final bill, well, in most

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.409
countries.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.570
I can't speak for
every country here.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.820
But in finance,
those conflicts are

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:02.190
so evident that there are
sets of rules, usually, that

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.327
promote some transparency
that you know

00:35:04.327 --> 00:35:06.840
what the advisor is getting.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.460
But some practices
are prohibited.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.410
So these are some of the
core things that, at least,

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:17.850
I think are embedded as
concepts in our securities laws,

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.970
and not just here in the
US but around the globe.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.070
Any questions on that before--

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.000
Brotish?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.490
AUDIENCE: So on the
first point, if we

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.160
are saying that we have some
sort of a minimum disclosure

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.385
requirement for ICOs, do you
think in this kind of a field,

00:35:33.385 --> 00:35:35.880
do we have the regulators
who have the expertise

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.338
to judge whether those
requirements are met or not?

00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:40.380
Like, they can say that--

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.360
GARY GENSLER: Are you
asking whether the investors

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.250
will have the expertise,
or the regulators?

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.921
AUDIENCE: Regulators.

00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:47.500
GARY GENSLER: It's
a good question.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.910
I think that the concept is
that issuers should share

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.240
a certain level of
material information

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.470
with potential investors, and
then investors assess the risk,

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.620
not that the regulator assesses
the risk but the investors.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.220
So the question is,
what is material?

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.820
And what needs to be shared
in what readable fashion?

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.380
And maybe it's the
case in this ecosystem

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.530
that the information should
be a little different.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.500
Historically, you'd have to
share three years of financials

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.270
or two years of financials.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.170
But what do financials mean if
it's a new concept, a new idea?

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.530
So I think you
raise a good point

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.410
that it might need to
shift a little bit.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.610
But the core concept is that
the material information

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:41.880
to make an investment
decision should be shared,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.590
and then investors
have an opportunity

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.342
to assess that risk.

00:36:45.342 --> 00:36:46.050
And you're right.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:50.500
The regulators are less
experienced in this space

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.580
to say what is a material bit
of information beyond here's

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.575
the team, and
here's the concept.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.510
The Howey Test.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.740
So there is an
individual in Florida.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.750
He ran for governor
twice in Florida

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.390
and lost twice, just
a little background--

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.670
William Howey.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.560
He was also very
successful in real estate,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.610
and he had a hotel.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.520
And he had something
called Howey on the Hills.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.470
And he started buying
a bunch of land.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.870
And then he thought, well,
I'll sell some of the land

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:31.060
and grow orange groves.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.300
And when he sold the land,
he gave the opportunity

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.850
to investors in
the land to enter

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.210
into a separate
contract with a company

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.950
he had, but it was not required.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:46.300
You could buy the land, you
know, an acre, three acres.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.460
But he said, if
you want, you can

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.040
enter into a contract
with my affiliate--

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.390
Howey on the Hills, I think,
was the affiliate, as well--

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.910
and we'll grow your
oranges for you

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:03.110
and give you the revenues
from growing the oranges.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:08.650
So there was a new law
in the US in the 1930s.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.080
He was doing this
in the late 1930s.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.640
And the new law was called the
Securities Laws of '33 and '34.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.730
The question was, was what
William Howey was doing--

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.235
and then he passed
away-- was his estate

00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:25.540
and what they were doing
a security under the US

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.220
Securities Law?

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.560
Well, in the US,
the word "security"

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:36.410
was defined by our Congress to
include equity, bonds, options,

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.150
and there was a comma, and
said, "investment contracts."

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.070
So the real question
was, what was

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.790
the definition of this, two
words, "investment contracts?"

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.360
In 1946, it went to
our US Supreme Court.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.580
And this was the four-part test.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.510
And this four-part test is going
back to the US Supreme Court

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.550
three or four times since then.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.790
And it's been
affirmed every time,

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.010
in the Edwards case and
other cases and so forth

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.870
over 70 years.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:09.220
This same four-part test went
to the Taiwanese high court

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.130
in 2011, and they adopted it.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.040
I don't know enough
about Taiwan law.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.650
But it was adopted
in Taiwan in 2011.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.260
And it's a similar
test as in Canada.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.430
So there's three jurisdictions
that basically have this.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.840
Is it an investment
of money or assets?

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.390
Is the investment in
a common enterprise?

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.060
Do you have a reasonable
expectation of profits?

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.970
And is it based on
the efforts of others?

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:40.490
So they determined that William
Howey, and then his estate

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.580
afterwards, was basically
a common enterprise growing

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.240
all these oranges, and so it
was the expectation of profits.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.840
That's the Howey Test.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.390
I've talked to you before
about the Duck Test.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:01.630
But when I see an investment
that walks like a duck,

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.730
swims like a duck, and
quacks like a duck,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.420
I call that investment
a security, in a way.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.150
But that's really it, you
know, using your common sense.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:17.910
Ethereum, when it was
first promoted in 2014,

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:22.430
I believe passed this test.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.510
And the word "passed" means
that you are a security, just

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.460
a little vocabulary thing.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.660
You want to fail the
Howey Test, by the way.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.370
Like, if you are a
venture capitalist

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.640
and don't want to be regulated,
you want to fail this test.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.400
But to pass the Howey
test, Ethereum, in 2014,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.050
exchanged Bitcoin for an ETH.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.910
It was an investment
in a common enterprise

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.990
at that point in time, a 20-
or 21-year-old Vitalik Buterin

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:58.860
running Ethereum Foundation
out of Switzerland.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.270
It was one group.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:04.280
An expectation of profits--

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.900
they had no functioning network.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.230
It was just an idea and a white
paper-- a really good idea--

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.620
and good-faith actors.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.200
And it was reliant on whether
Vitalik and his team of coders

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.500
were going to stand
this project up.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.720
To me, I don't even think
there's much doubt what

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.890
this was in 2014 when they
raised the $18 million.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.640
Now, it was the largest
ICO done at the time.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.526
There hadn't been anything
of its size, at $18 million.

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:40.070
And our US Securities agency
and others around the globe

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.260
really weren't
looking and watching

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:49.340
until the DAO happened in 2016
and raised $160 or so million.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.850
And then that sort of
caught the attention.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:57.890
So regulators start to wake up
and think about it after that.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.200
So initial coin offerings,
we've already talked about this.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.960
But the proceeds are
used to build networks.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.690
And purchasers anticipate
profits through appreciation.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:12.350
So that's like the
core of the Howey Test.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.690
Now, some jurisdictions
don't have the Howey Test.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.790
And some jurisdictions
don't have those two words

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:21.440
in the definition of security--
"investment contract."

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.500
So I actually think, in
a lot of jurisdictions,

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.560
an initial coin offering may not
be a security because it's not

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.080
defined in their statutes.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.350
It's not some legislative
body like ours in the 1930s

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.380
included it in a definition.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.783
But I believe if this
market were to grow,

00:42:38.783 --> 00:42:40.700
and it might not grow,
but if it were to grow,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.070
other countries might want
to address that and change

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.220
their statutory language
because investors still

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.530
have an asymmetry and could
benefit with more disclosure.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.180
As we've talked
about, the tokens

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.700
are usually prior
to being functional.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.960
What was the statistic?

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.880
Does anybody remember?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.180
In the third quarter
of 2018, what

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.370
was the percent
that was functional?

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.790
Anybody?

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.460
What's that, Alpha?

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.235
5%?

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:10.110
You're a little high.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.175
AUDIENCE: 2%-- 2% or 3%?

00:43:12.175 --> 00:43:13.110
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:19.550
1.4%-- 1.37% was
fully-ready product.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.270
Or 1.7 was code,
so we'll round up.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.940
But 76% were on ideas.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:32.040
And this is in the third quarter
of 2018 by CryptoCompare.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.250
And here are some
large tokens offerings

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.410
that have yet to go live.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.600
And I just picked
five really big ones.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.570
That doesn't mean that all
big ones haven't gone live.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:51.450
But you were asking me about
Filecoin in our last class.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.865
I think Filecoin--

00:43:55.695 --> 00:43:57.570
I went back, and I looked
at the white paper;

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.445
I've looked at a lot of
things about Filecoin

00:43:59.445 --> 00:44:01.130
since last Tuesday--

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.330
Filecoin is basically
coin that says

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:08.340
you can use this coin when we
go live, which hopefully will be

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:13.110
by the second quarter of '19,
to buy file storage from others

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.350
that are on the network.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:21.100
Their business model--
Filecoin sold 10% of the token.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:25.920
So if it was truly worth
$257 million at the time,

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.860
they, in essence, had a total
value of $2 and 1/2 billion.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.060
Some of the tokens were
kept by the company.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.290
Some of the tokens
were kept by founders.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:43.340
But it, in essence, capitalized
the total stock 10 times that.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:48.320
So in that model,
the usage of the coin

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.430
was amongst the
community, to answer--

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.980
I think that was a question
you asked me to go back.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.580
But that's not the
case for every ICO.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.470
There's two stark variations.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.310
One is one where you use the
token to buy a good or service

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.660
from a service provider.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.870
Let's, in the case
of Filecoin, say

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.330
it's directly from Filecoin.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:14.150
Or you use the token to
buy a good or service

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.400
from other people
in the community.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.470
The Filecoin white
paper suggests--

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.010
it's a year since
they wrote it--

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:26.940
that it's a token to be used
amongst the community, which

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.440
I think was your--

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.430
it's a little confusing
because they haven't gone live.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.020
We don't really know.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.520
Hugo?

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.395
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about Ripple--

00:45:36.395 --> 00:45:37.260
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.910
AUDIENCE: --and if
you have an opinion

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.610
on whether XRP is a security
that was sold by Ripple,

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.080
or currently continuing
to be sold by Ripple,

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.100
as they own, like, 55
billion of the clients,

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.910
because, also,
their product, what

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.740
they want XRP to be used on,
xRapid, isn't really live.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.548
xCurrent is the thing that
they're using most right now.

00:46:00.548 --> 00:46:02.965
And that's just an alternative
for SWIFT that doesn't even

00:46:02.965 --> 00:46:04.470
use their coin.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.760
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo has
asked about the token XRP

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.130
and whether I think it's
a non-compliant security.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.210
I've spoken publicly.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.200
Yes, I do think it's a
non-compliant security.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.560
But this will not be resolved
just by the Securities

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.560
and Exchange Commission.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.540
It will be resolved
by some courts,

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.300
whether it's appellate
courts or the Supreme Court.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.600
So what I believe is just that.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.830
It's a belief.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.680
But why would I say that?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.600
I think back to the Howey Test.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.310
I think they are exchanging XRP.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.190
Ripple, the company,
is exchanging

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.220
XRP for something of value.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.930
And they're using it right now.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.300
They sell it every month.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.460
It's in a lock-up.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.530
It's in an escrow.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.890
And they sell XRP every month.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:54.540
Ripple, the company, initially
did the genesis block back

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.720
in 2013 but kept
80% of the tokens.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.460
Now they have about
60% of the token.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.050
But they sell it on a continuous
100 million to 200 million

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.980
or so a month of value.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.100
Two, I think it is reliant
on a common enterprise.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.830
I think Ripple, the company--

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:23.710
XRP investors are very much
reliant on Ripple, the company,

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.590
and that if Ripple, the company,
went away, as you noted,

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.440
there's not much use of XRP.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.010
In fact, for the first
three or four years,

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.990
or five years even,
there was no use.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:41.410
And then they prototyped
something called xRapid.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.590
xCurrent, the main product
of Ripple, the company,

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.790
is a messaging-- and
apparently a clever one

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.220
that's competing with SWIFT.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:59.410
But xRapid, the prototype,
doesn't have a large community

00:47:59.410 --> 00:47:59.950
right now.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:05.050
So it's highly centralized
around Ripple, the company.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.600
The development,
the node network--

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.650
the ownership is 55%
or 60% owned by them.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.280
They're promoting it as such.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.310
But it will be settled in some
court at some point in time.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.310
And there might be
regulatory forbearance.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.830
And maybe they'll be
determined not to be.

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.340
But I've expressed my thoughts.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.750
I don't own any of this stuff.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.710
I don't have any
particular conflict.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:34.420
I'm just speaking as I believe.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.440
Catalina?

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.120
AUDIENCE: Regarding
how do you determine

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.990
where the ICO took place--

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.165
GARY GENSLER: Where, what?

00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:44.050
AUDIENCE: Where
the ICO took place,

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.520
what is the jurisdiction?

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.320
Like, which will
be the regulator

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.990
if they are under the laws
of the US or everywhere else,

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.167
because the blockchain--

00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:55.000
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.990
GARY GENSLER: No, it's
a very good question.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.125
So jurisdiction.

00:48:59.125 --> 00:49:01.930
When does any country
have jurisdiction?

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.730
Or maybe I should
ask it differently.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:08.410
When do you think countries
try to exert their jurisdiction

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.660
in the context of
capital markets?

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.330
We're not talking about the
context of consumable goods.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.610
But in terms of the
capital markets,

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.460
where do jurisdictions usually
exert their jurisdiction?

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.530
AUDIENCE: I think that this
should be a [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:29.750
which investor
will take the ICO.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:30.620
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.870
AUDIENCE: So even if they're
not majority of investor,

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.400
it will be a US person.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.820
So it should be a US
regulator who handles this.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.030
GARY GENSLER: So
one approach theory

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.210
is it's where the investors are.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.680
And you even used the word
a "majority" of investors,

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.150
or just where the investors are?

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's correct.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:48.910
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.297
So where the investors are.

00:49:50.297 --> 00:49:52.630
And then the question is, how
many investors-- minority,

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.600
majority, de minimis, so forth.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.975
Another point of view,
any, just, counter--

00:49:59.975 --> 00:50:01.850
AUDIENCE: Where the
company was incorporated.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:02.850
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.200
So where the company's
legal jurisdiction is.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.630
Maybe the company's
incorporated somewhere.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.780
So in essence,
where the issuer is.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.340
And there's a third one.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.557
AUDIENCE: Tax considerations.

00:50:13.557 --> 00:50:14.640
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.848
AUDIENCE: Tax considerations.

00:50:15.848 --> 00:50:18.380
GARY GENSLER: Tax
considerations, you know,

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.720
can you collect taxes?

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.730
AUDIENCE: Where the team
is physically located.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.690
GARY GENSLER: Where the, what?

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.650
AUDIENCE: Where the
team is physically--

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.350
GARY GENSLER: The team,
the physical team.

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.642
So you might legally incorporate
in the Cayman Islands,

00:50:27.642 --> 00:50:30.805
but your executive team might
be in New York or in Beijing.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:37.300
And the one other, which I
think all of these go in--

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.550
AUDIENCE: The exchange.

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:39.790
GARY GENSLER: The exchange.

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:40.290
All right.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.380
The secondary markets.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.210
So all of these things
somehow influence

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.600
the concept of jurisdiction.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.890
And there's various laws.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:53.260
And each country has
their own different--

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.830
I'm not going to do a
whole review of this.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:01.265
But usually countries want
to exert their jurisdiction

00:51:01.265 --> 00:51:04.030
if their citizens
somehow are affected

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:07.810
or if their tax base
is somehow affected.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:13.870
So in the US securities laws,
if it's affecting US citizens

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.240
or if the exchange
or secondary markets

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.690
are in our physical
jurisdiction, in the 50 states

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:27.400
and so forth, or the issuer, so
it's all three of these, often

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.060
there's some exertion
of jurisdiction.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.670
And it's upheld in the courts.

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.650
And then you get
to some issuers who

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.050
have to deal with
multiple jurisdictions.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.780
And almost every
large corporation

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.600
that has investors in
multiple jurisdictions

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.260
has to deal with the investor
laws in multiple jurisdictions.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.910
So initial coin
offerings, if they

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:56.575
want to tap into US 328 million
people to buy some of these,

00:51:56.575 --> 00:51:58.420
it's more than a de minimis.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.010
It's not a majority.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.507
US law doesn't need a majority.

00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:04.090
It just has to be
more than a handful.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.210
US Securities and
Exchange Commission

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.575
might exert its jurisdiction.

00:52:11.575 --> 00:52:12.535
It doesn't always.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.915
So please.

00:52:16.915 --> 00:52:20.440
AUDIENCE: So some of these
ICOs, Filecoin, I think,

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.650
included, only sold to
accredited investors.

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.360
In my mind, that
doesn't really change

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.085
the definition of security or
highly taxed or jurisdiction.

00:52:29.085 --> 00:52:31.810
So what is the benefit
of only selling

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:32.820
to accredited investors?

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.570
GARY GENSLER: Can I
hold that, because I'm

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:35.528
going to slide on that?

00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:38.800
But it's a very good question.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.380
So the Ernst & Young study--

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.760
and I promise we'll get to it.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:49.462
So one year later, they looked
at the top 141 ICOs of 2017.

00:52:49.462 --> 00:52:50.920
I haven't looked
at the whole list.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.100
But I think they pretty
much got the top end.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:00.580
86% are trading below listed
price as of September 30.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.610
This does not take into
consideration the last week.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.130
But the number would go up--

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:07.930
86% nine months later.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:13.450
30% have lost substantially
all their value, and not

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.320
necessarily scams and frauds.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.040
But it's interesting to compare
that to Christian Catalini's

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.380
25% scam or fraud number.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.650
But these are the
top 141 in size.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:28.630
These aren't the
small riff-raff size.

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:32.230
Collectively, the
portfolio is down 66%.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.450
I didn't go back to
compare what that

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:38.050
would be versus Bitcoin
because some of these

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.470
were issued in
October, some December.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.350
But collectively, if you
invested in the port--

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.680
it's not January
1 to September 30.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.840
It's from investment day.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.770
And only 13% have
working products and 16%

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:57.240
have prototypes.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.580
Another interesting
thing is the 13%

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:04.170
that have working products,
which is about 25 of these.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.370
Is that right?

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.985
Roughly, yeah, about
25 or so, 20 to 25.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.020
Seven of them have decided
subsequent to launch

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:20.920
to accept fiat currency to
get the good or service.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.870
So literally, if you dig into
the Ernst & Young report,

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:28.630
they've chosen to
take something else.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:33.630
And Hugo, back to your question
about XRP, as I understand it

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:40.890
and as I studied it, I might
be mistaken, but xRapid,

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:43.770
you can actually use
something other than XRP

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:44.730
as the bridge currency.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.290
It has to be another crypto.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:56.620
But 7 of 25 live projects
that Ernst & Young followed

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.710
have decided subsequently
maybe to take a fiat currency

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:03.600
for the good or
service, as well.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.460
So that kind of
gives you the sense

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.720
this was a note about the
Catalini report and that status

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.500
report, as well.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.930
What's going on on Ethereum?

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:18.150
This is the most recent report.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:21.360
I summarized
something from a site.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.350
These are exchanges.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:27.840
There's 179 DApps.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:33.120
This is just
looking at Ethereum.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:41.880
But there's only 25,000
uses a day for 179 sites.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.650
17,000 in gambling.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:48.100
But it's exchanges, gambling,
games, finance fourth.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.260
And then you can go down.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.990
The other category, which
only has 275 daily uses,

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:59.080
covers governance, identity,
security, energy, insurance,

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.510
and health.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.510
Of six of those use cases--

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:08.410
218 DApps, which means they're
all being used zero or once

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:08.910
a day.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:15.540
I believe I pulled this
for the month of October.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.100
I think all these stats are--

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:23.270
yeah, this was for
the month of October.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:28.863
So it might be September, but
it's all current information.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.180
So what has the SEC
done in this space?

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.790
Well, they brought the DAO
report in July of 2017.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:45.650
If you remember, this was
the big $150, $160 million

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:48.200
big ICO in 2016.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.450
A third of it was hacked.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:53.450
It led to the break in
the Ethereum network

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.045
between Ethereum Classic,
the hard fork, and Ethereum.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.960
DAO actually shut down.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.640
It didn't take off.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.940
And a year later,
the SEC did not

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.590
bring an enforcement action.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:12.960
They chose not to
penalize anybody.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.850
But they laid out in pretty
good detail as to why

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:19.700
these things were securities.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.428
I don't think they
had planned for what

00:57:21.428 --> 00:57:22.470
was going to happen next.

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:26.690
But the ICO, boom, took off, I
don't think because of the DAO

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.710
report.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.540
But it's an
interesting coincidence

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.818
whether this kind of
gave a bunch of lawyers

00:57:31.818 --> 00:57:33.360
and entrepreneurs
a sense, all right,

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.980
if I avoid doing what
they did specifically--

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:42.170
and the DAO, they actually
paid part of the revenues

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:47.310
to the token holders, and they
gave a sense of voting rights.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:50.120
So it was so security-looking
because there

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.330
were a form of
participation in governance

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:56.030
and a form of
participation in profits

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.760
that everything took off.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.030
Then then the SEC
did two other things.

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:07.580
One was-- the REcoin complaint
was a real fraudulent player,

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:11.360
and the Munchee order
in December last year.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.460
I read that in
January or February.

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.440
And I thought, well,
that's pretty clear.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.630
And Jay Clayton,
who runs the SEC,

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:19.880
has said in congressional
testimony in February

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.660
that he hadn't met an ICO that
he didn't think was a security.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.400
His words were a
little different.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.320
But I thought between
the Munchee order

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.760
and Chairman Clayton's
statement in February,

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.390
he had really said it.

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:38.980
But it wasn't quite enough.

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.450
And the Munchee order, again,
they didn't assess penalties.

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:42.980
But it was an offering--

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.040
I can't remember the
size-- $20 to $30 million.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.010
They knocked on Munchee's--

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:51.810
Munchee, by the way, does
anybody know what the coin did?

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:54.350
It was for restaurant reviews--

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.910
munchie, food.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:56.660
Yeah.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.110
But they knocked on the
Munchee folks' door right

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.470
as they were doing the offering.

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:03.230
And they basically
shut down the offering.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.920
But then they did
a whole bunch of--

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.320
there's five or six of
these, almost all of which

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.630
are really scammy,
fraudy-type things.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.060
I mean, I can't
speak to each one.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.760
But they'd have some celebrity
that was paid a lot of money

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.890
to go out to hawk the coins.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:27.080
And there wasn't much
behind it, and so forth.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.490
Asset freezes, filing
complaints in courts,

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:34.460
emergency court orders,
one settlement--

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:36.530
it takes a long time
to build a case.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.250
Having been the chairman of
a smaller regulatory agency,

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.790
I can tell you it just takes
a long time to build cases.

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:46.610
It's not, like, three months.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:47.780
Sometimes it's a year.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.430
Sometimes it's even three years.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.370
But the last two, Airfox
and Paragon orders,

00:59:56.370 --> 01:00:01.080
were two offerings that were
done 12 to 15 months ago,

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.180
so a long time to
bring it together.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.920
But they were settlements.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.470
And Paragon and Airfox,
which each raised,

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.920
I don't know, $12 or $18 million
each or $15 or $18 million

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.940
each, appeared on the surface
to be more good-faith actors.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.850
I can't speak-- I
don't know for sure,

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:21.172
but the first time the
SEC has gotten penalties,

01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.755
the first time they've
gotten somebody

01:00:22.755 --> 01:00:26.430
to say yes, if somebody wants
their money back a year later,

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:27.840
we'll do that.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.640
And yes, we'll come
into compliance,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.447
and we'll do offering documents.

01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:35.280
So now I'm going to
talk a little bit about,

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.350
what can you do?

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:41.572
And I think Zhenyu asked this
question, what can you do?

01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:43.530
And I'm going to do it
in two different charts.

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:47.070
But the first one is called
restricted offerings.

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:49.060
And this is not a
securities law class.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:52.670
This is just to give you a sense
of what are the potentials.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:58.440
A restricted offering,
which came out 30-plus years

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.880
ago at first, was
the concept of,

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.830
I'm not doing a public
offering, I'm only

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:08.268
selling these securities
in a private placement.

01:01:08.268 --> 01:01:09.810
In my day, when I
was on Wall Street,

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.210
we called these
private placements.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:16.020
But a restricted offering-- and
there's three different ones.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:21.180
The most likely
one is the 506(c)

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.700
which came out of a recent law
passed in 2012 called the JOBS

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.605
Act in Congress.

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:31.350
Don't you love how we
name our laws in the US?

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:32.460
The JOBS Act.

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.420
Accredited investors only.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.930
And an accredited investor--
and every jurisdiction

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.990
is different--
the concept is you

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:46.410
have a little bit of net
worth, or a lot of net worth,

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:48.870
depending upon your
view about money,

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:52.470
but you have enough net
worth that you supposedly

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:56.430
are sophisticated or
accredited or you can have less

01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:59.130
protection under
this securities law,

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:03.450
unless you need
less information.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:09.780
So 506(c) says,
"accredited investors."

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.780
If that's all it is, it's
a restricted security,

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:16.740
"restricted" meaning you cannot
sell it publicly for either six

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.720
months or 12 months depending
upon how you structure these

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.220
things.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.420
And the big thing about all
of the restricted offerings

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.450
is you don't have to do one
of those detailed information

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:31.580
statements.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.200
So the SEC says, all right,
if you keep it restricted,

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.080
it's only accredited investors.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.810
Or the 506(b)--
accredited investors,

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.260
but 35 people can be
sophisticated rather than

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.130
accredited.

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.200
Please don't challenge
me on the definitions

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.480
of what's sophisticated
and not accredited.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.420
It's basically, you
can show sophistication

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.710
even if you don't have money.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:54.980
Accredited is about how
much money you have.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:03:01.800
Sophisticated is knowledge but
not money, roughly speaking.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.410
And then there's a small
thing for small offerings.

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.150
Regulation D is
what most of them--

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:11.070
Telegram did a Regulation D.
[INAUDIBLE],, to let you know,

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:14.370
I think Filecoin did
a Reg D offering.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:19.500
Generally speaking, it's, quote,
"accredited investors," meaning

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.580
they have enough money.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.080
They have over,
I can't remember,

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.500
a million bucks or
whatever that number is.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.300
Regulation A is
offering statement.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.890
So you have to give a statement.

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:35.530
You have to give something
with the financials.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:39.490
Not many ICOs want to
do a Reg A offering.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:41.950
But if you were doing a startup,
if you're thinking about,

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.980
like, you're in one of
the wonderful venture

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.220
classes, fintech ventures
or other venture classes,

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.840
you might consider doing a Reg
A offering rather than a Reg D.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.960
The benefit of Reg
A, Regulation A,

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.160
is you can go to any investors.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.030
You don't have to only limit
to accredited investors.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:05.090
So Regulation D, only
accredited investors, generally,

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.980
with a little footnote about
sophisticated investors.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.760
Regulation A, you've got to
give them more information.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.790
You have to address some of
that information asymmetry.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:20.050
There's two tiers-- $20
million and $50 million.

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:23.440
The $50 million offering,
you have ongoing reporting

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.250
obligations.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.100
The $20 million, you
just have to get yourself

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.120
around doing something
at the beginning.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.600
But how do you do financials
for an ICO when there's--

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.760
oh, I guess you just say you
have no revenues, no income,

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.550
et cetera.

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:42.050
There's something very
new called Regulation CF,

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:43.920
or crowdfunding.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.580
Unless you're raising less
than a million dollars,

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.950
you wouldn't put
it on your list.

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.020
So almost no initial
coin offerings

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.880
are looking at Reg CF.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.640
They're basically
looking mostly at what

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.050
we used to call private
placements or restricted

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:04.110
offerings, Regulation D.
That's where most of them are.

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:08.930
And you have to use
good-faith efforts

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.170
to make sure that every
one of your investors

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:16.120
is, in fact, an
accredited investor.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.080
And that's where it is.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.650
Questions.

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:20.266
AUDIENCE: Do all of
these regulations, D, A,

01:05:20.266 --> 01:05:24.370
and CF, entail KYC and AML?

01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:25.840
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
so the question

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.010
is, do you have to know
your customer and any money

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:31.510
laundering?

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.320
And the answer is yes because
over the last couple of decades

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.190
what's happened is finance
ministries around the globe,

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.140
and this is not
just here in the US,

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.510
have kind of layered
on top of securities

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:45.610
laws, hey, we need
your help here

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.850
because there's this public
policy goal of making sure

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.730
that you can't money launder.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:56.360
So yes, but in varying degrees.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.835
So in the Regulation
D requirements,

01:05:58.835 --> 01:06:00.460
you have to make the
good-faith efforts

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.550
when you do the initial sale.

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.270
And purportedly,
it's restricted.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.210
And it's not supposed to be
resold for either six or 12

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.680
months.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.960
But on the resale,
the issuer doesn't

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:17.280
have the same obligations,
where some of the others, you

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.940
would have more continuing
obligations on the resale.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.340
So I think that some
have tried to get around

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.830
this in doing a Reg D
offering and then said,

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:30.180
can I get some crypto
exchange to list this ICO?

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.060
And I'm going to
turn a blind eye--

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.670
I think it's bad legal
advice they're taking--

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.210
but turn a blind eye as to
where it gets sold on that.

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:40.340
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.030
But I think some are doing
that on the resale and not,

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:49.170
maybe, doing KYC or
AML on the resale.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:52.600
At least that's
what some tell me.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.180
Please.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.480
AUDIENCE: I've heard
some crypto folks argue

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.920
that the definition of
the accredited investor

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.730
is not particularly
relevant in this ICO space.

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.220
And actually, having
investable assets

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.955
doesn't make you well-placed
to understand whether an ICO is

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:06.580
a good product.

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.260
And actually, having
technical skills

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.970
and being able to
read a white paper

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.390
is a more relevant qualification
to allow you to invest

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.820
and that by having these
regulations, in a way

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.170
you're restricting access.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.518
And that promotes inequality,
that only rich people

01:07:19.518 --> 01:07:21.310
are getting these
investment opportunities.

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.268
So I've heard crypto
people make this argument.

01:07:23.268 --> 01:07:25.630
So I guess, what would
your response to that be?

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:29.080
GARY GENSLER: And I will hear
your classmate's response.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I would
say that rich people don't

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.180
know how to handle money,
necessarily, anyway.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.370
So there isn't a
direct correlation

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.630
between having wealth and
knowing how to use it.

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:41.850
The law exists the way it does
because of diversification

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:44.740
and because of asset allocation
theory and the idea that people

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.180
don't understand that.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.600
And I think that even if
you have technical expertise

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.760
in crypto, you may not
understand asset allocation

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.940
theory and be able to
balance what you need when.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.250
And basically, the
law is set up such

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.910
that you can lose all of that.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:02.080
And even if you're very
savvy, you can be very savvy

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.160
and still be wrong, and
you've lost more than you own.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.710
And that wouldn't be OK.

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:10.440
So I think from the government's
perspective, it is what it is.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.070
AUDIENCE: I would
just respond to say

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.028
that I don't know if it's
the government's role

01:08:14.028 --> 01:08:15.180
to police that.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.970
GARY GENSLER: Sorry,
can you speak up?

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:20.710
AUDIENCE: I think both
of the points are right.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:23.319
It's my opinion that it's
not the government's role

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.350
to decide that you don't get
to invest in something that you

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:31.060
believe in or worked on
because you may not understand

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.279
portfolio theory,
just because you

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.359
don't have a two-year
track record of making

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.939
$200,000 a year.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:41.560
GARY GENSLER: No, it's
a very good question.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.649
And there's this public
policy debate as to,

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:49.540
if you have a belief that
investor protection helps

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.000
promote markets and investor
protection is about addressing

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.270
some information asymmetries
and protecting against fraud

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:04.290
and bad actors, do you tier it?

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:10.170
Now, in the US, we've decided
on some multiple-decade--

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:12.600
Republicans and Democrats
alike, somehow we've

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.319
come to a tiered system,
meaning that there's

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:20.550
more investor protection,
more rules and regulations,

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:27.880
for what's usually called the
retail public than some tiering

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.649
of usually higher net
worth individuals,

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.250
this term "accredited investor."

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.620
And that tiering, you could
come to a point of view

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.069
that we shouldn't have any
tiering, that everybody should

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:42.399
have the same protections, and
it should be, maybe, somewhere

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.140
in the middle of the two.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.359
Or you might be
more pro-protection

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.180
or less pro-protection.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.340
But we have come to
a place in the US

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.370
over multiple decades
of this tiering, where

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.805
the, quote, "accredited
investors" get a little less.

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:05.960
They're allowed to risk their
capital with less information.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.680
That's, in essence, what
happens in the system.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.580
And Congress even pressed
harder because the Regulation

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.750
D, restricted
offerings, the 506(c)

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:25.430
was added in this thing
called the JOBS Act in 2012.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.760
Some of the politics behind
it was a venture capital space

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.300
and a lot of entrepreneurial
space were saying,

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:39.720
we'd like a less-regulated,
restricted offering exemption.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.270
Remember, these are all called
exempt security offerings.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:46.380
They're exempt from
the traditional roles.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:50.640
And there was a coalition
that came together in Congress

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.460
with the support
of President Obama,

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.330
actually not with the support
of the head of his Securities

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:57.330
and Exchange Commission.

01:10:57.330 --> 01:11:00.640
Mary Shapiro at the time was
not in favor of some of this.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.760
So it was an interesting
event in 2012.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.100
But I think 506(c),
if I remember,

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.422
was either expanded or
was added, to say, well,

01:11:11.422 --> 01:11:12.880
if it's accredited
investors, there

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.110
will be no limitation
on general solicitation.

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:18.570
If you see, 506(b),
traditionally, there

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.420
was a limitation on
general solicitation.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.000
And the thought was, in
2012, now with the internet,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.530
we should be able to--

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:29.460
and crowdsourcing had started.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.730
And Kickstarter and
GoFundMe had started.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:37.290
So maybe we can have, quote,
"general solicitation" if it's

01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:38.820
only accredited investors.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.505
So it was a bit of a legislative
and policy compromise.

01:11:43.505 --> 01:11:44.880
But you could take
the other side

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.380
and say everybody should have
the same, one way or the other.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.367
But whether you're
thinking about blockchain

01:11:53.367 --> 01:11:55.950
or you're thinking about all the
other wonderful things you're

01:11:55.950 --> 01:12:00.120
thinking about as startups,
these are your three main ways.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.330
And really, probably,
Regulation D and Regulation A

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.787
more than the small million.

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.620
I have high hopes for
all of you that you'll

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.905
be raising more than a million
dollars in your startups.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:14.850
This is a much more detailed--

01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:15.820
I'm not going to go through it.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.112
But it's going to be in Canvas.

01:12:17.112 --> 01:12:19.500
I decided to throw it in the
slide deck so you have it.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.130
But this really is a
much more detailed review

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.800
of the CrowdCheck put together.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.050
And I thought it was a
good review of all these.

01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:30.390
So what do I think
the path forward is?

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:33.570
And then we'll wrap.

01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:35.250
So I think we're
going to continue

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.990
to see high failure rates.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:45.100
Something like 3,000 ICOs have
raised some bits of money.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.530
I mean, some of them
only raised $200,000.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:51.370
But you can only
find about 700 or 800

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:53.470
of them listed on
various websites,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.200
if you want to see
where they're traded.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.270
But there's probably more than
700 that are still around.

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:02.860
But I think you're
going to continue

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:08.980
to see high failure rates like
the Ernst & Young study showed.

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.310
I think it's going to lead to
a further decline in funding

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:13.210
totals.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:16.810
We've already seen
that we were running

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:21.110
$1 and 1/2 to $3 billion
a month earlier this year.

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:23.920
And now we're less than a
billion dollars a month.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.650
But I think high failure
rates will probably

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:31.600
lead to lower funding totals.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.370
It's just Gensler's view.

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:37.240
Predicting markets is always
a treacherous thing to do.

01:13:40.242 --> 01:13:42.700
I think that there'll be an
increased number of enforcement

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.380
cases and private litigation.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.200
We've seen only 11 or
12 actually at the SEC.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.590
These cases are hard
to put together.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.980
They take a long time.

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.690
A lot of evidence
and a lot of paper

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:55.620
trails to put
together and so forth.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.513
And even a civil law enforcement
agency like the SEC--

01:13:59.513 --> 01:14:01.180
I don't know their
headcount right now--

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.460
the whole agency might
be about 4,000 people.

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.310
Their enforcement arm
might be 1,000 people.

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.830
They can't dedicate--
you know, what are they

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:09.890
dedicating to this?

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:10.890
I don't know the number.

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:12.440
It's not a public figure.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.820
But could it be 50
or 100 people at most

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.960
to this whole world, which
probably has hundreds of frauds

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:26.420
and scams and a couple thousand
of unregistered, basically

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.230
illegal, offerings?

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:34.520
But I do think the enforcement
actions will pick up,

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.760
and also private
litigation, which is also

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.560
what you have in the XRP case.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.770
But you have it in
other cases, as well.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.380
I think regulators and courts
will bring greater clarity

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.670
to the security definition.

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.370
At some point in time, things
like XRP will decide it.

01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:51.340
It might be decided
it's not a security.

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.420
You know?

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.220
But I think that's
going to roll out

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.440
over the next 18 to 36 months.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.740
It's not like the next
three weeks or six weeks.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.430
But I think that even the
Securities and Exchange

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:09.590
Commission will speak more
definitively than Bill Hinman's

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:13.040
speech he gave in, was it June?

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.120
Yeah, June.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.740
That was one of the
readings, right--

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.550
Director Hinman's.

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:20.960
I like that he used my name
in his speech, the title.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.620
He was talking about
Gary, Indiana, though.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:28.800
But I do think, just like
what happened with Airfox

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.390
and Paragon, more ICOs will
be brought into compliance

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:36.230
either by registering in
the US under Reg D, or maybe

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:39.410
Regulation A. Or they'll just
come into compliance even

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:43.160
if they didn't earlier
come into compliance.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.690
I think that the
early tokens will

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:51.260
be tested as some platforms
become functional.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.670
Most will fail.

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:55.920
Most we'll never hear from.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.080
But what happens when
Filecoin actually-- they

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.715
raised a quarter of
a billion dollars.

01:16:02.751 --> 01:16:06.060
Let's at least for now presume
they will become functional

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.410
sometime in 2019, or Telegraph.

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:11.010
That will be
interesting to see what

01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:15.140
the test of these
large-cap ICOs are.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.500
We'll learn from that.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:21.100
I also think markets will
better differentiate viability.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.750
They'll go through,
when do you need

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:28.380
an append-only log, consensus
among multiple parties,

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:33.810
and a native token on
a distributed ledger?

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:36.240
That wasn't happening,
probably, enough

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.470
in late 2017 and early 2018.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.970
I don't think they had to take
this class, even though we'll

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:45.070
put it out live, and people
will be able to see it.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:48.090
But I think markets will start
to differentiate viability

01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:51.210
by CO use cases a little better
than they have the last 12

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.620
months.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.130
So any questions?

01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:56.630
Eric?

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:57.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.990
There's a bunch of startups
we've been checking out.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:03.390
They're going through
a new approach.

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:06.210
There is actually a lot
of venture capital firms

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:10.740
that are doing a
financing stage pre-ICO

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.060
to help these startups
build the actual network.

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:18.420
And in that case, when
they go to post-ICO,

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.740
you could argue that that helps,
building the network before

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:27.060
the ICOs can actually make
them fail the Howey Test,

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.010
because there's no--

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:33.030
in a sense, you have a network,
a decentralized arrangement,

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.830
that you don't have
the single enterprise--

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:38.970
GARY GENSLER: So I think, Eric,
you're raising two questions.

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:42.540
Are there ways to
stage your financing

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:48.600
to help build a network, just
as a pure money and finance?

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.480
And secondly, what is the
regulatory implication,

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.630
because I think it's two-part.

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:57.570
I think, like in
any form of venture,

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:00.790
you might stage your
financing and, in this case,

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:04.770
sort of address the
network possibility

01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:07.320
before you do the regulatory.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.950
And it may be enough.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.340
I mean, the US Securities
and Exchange Commission

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.600
and Hinman's speech sort of
said you could be sufficiently

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.056
decentralized as Ethereum.

01:18:19.056 --> 01:18:22.800
They, in essence, had some
regulatory forbearance.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.250
And there's a key sentence
in that speech as to,

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:29.110
I think the words were,
regardless of what Ethereum

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:31.460
might have been in 2014--

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.260
like, Hinman kind of pushed
that to the side and said,

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:38.670
I'm not going to address
that question implicitly.

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.890
But it's sufficiently
decentralized.

01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.780
That's the debate
that's going on now

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.260
between a bunch of
venture firms and the SEC.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.210
When are you sufficiently
decentralized?

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:55.720
And so that form that you
just mentioned might get us

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.900
there-- might.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.308
I don't know.

01:18:58.308 --> 01:18:59.600
Did you have one last question?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.283
And then we're going to--

01:19:00.283 --> 01:19:02.700
AUDIENCE: Maybe, just on the
second point about likelihood

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.667
of [INAUDIBLE],, [? which I ?]
obviously agree,

01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:06.750
is there any research on--

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.417
GARY GENSLER: This
is just a prediction.

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:09.745
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.620
I'll bet on it.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.950
How much of the ICO
funding was crypto to fiat

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:20.385
to crypto, people selling
appreciated bitcoins--

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:21.820
GARY GENSLER: Terrific question.

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:29.530
Almost all ICOs are
priced crypto to crypto.

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:31.900
So if you look at
whether the initial ones,

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.510
all the way back when the
Ethereum was priced vis-á-vis

01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:40.620
Bitcoin or, the most recent,
iOS that raised $4.2 billion,

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.180
their actual pricing mechanism--

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:48.820
I'm not familiar with any
that priced versus fiat.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:53.940
Their pricing mechanism in
their auction or offering,

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.950
it's almost always
crypto to crypto.

01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:59.938
But somebody might be
funding it fiat to crypto.

01:19:59.938 --> 01:20:01.480
But I think, to
answer your question,

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.920
you should assume 99% the actual
exchange is crypto to crypto.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.890
AUDIENCE: So I mean,
just the decline

01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:13.460
in the price of Ethereum to
Bitcoin, Bitcoin to cash almost

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:13.960
has to--

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.270
GARY GENSLER: It has
to put pressure on it.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:20.020
But I also think it is likely
that the decline in the ICO

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:24.360
market has put price pressure
downward on Ethereum, for sure.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.470
And so Ethereum was the
second-most valued crypto.

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.900
And now it's third.

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:37.030
And it's had more price
decline than Bitcoin or XRP.

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:38.950
And I think part of
that's narrative.

01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:42.940
Part of that story is
the decline in ICO space

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.260
is likely to put a
little decline on that.

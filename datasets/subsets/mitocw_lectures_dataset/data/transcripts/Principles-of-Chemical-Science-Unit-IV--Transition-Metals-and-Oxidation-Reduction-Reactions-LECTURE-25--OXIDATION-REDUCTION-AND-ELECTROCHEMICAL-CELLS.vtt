00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.230
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So this is
on oxidation--reduction go.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.600
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, so the demo
involves a strip of magnesium.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.769
And the magnesium is a
pretty reactive metal.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.560
Right now it's coated
with magnesium oxide.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.976
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to light it on fire.

00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:44.110
When it gets lit, it's going
to glow very, very brightly,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.710
and it's going to react with
this block of carbon dioxide.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.650
And magnesium oxide is
what you have up there.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.360
Both of those magnesium
oxide molecules

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.060
will react with one
molecule of carbon dioxide

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.750
to form just graphene, carbon,
as well as magnesium dioxide.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.350
So you're going to get
a white and black powder

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.287
inside of here.

00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:05.620
And it's going to be really
bright and really dangerous.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.500
And can we lower the lights?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.270
Is that something we
can do, because that

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.520
makes it a whole lot more fun?

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.380
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:58.010
CATHERINE DRENNAN: You can
try it one more time, OK?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.990
All right.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.485
OK, good try.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.080
So oxidation-reductions
are really fun.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.000
And so we're going to
continue and tell you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.590
about those on Friday.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.890
So oxidation-reduction,
or redox-- so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.320
redox is the shorthand
for oxidation-reduction.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.001
Let's bring out your hands,
but let's bring the noise level

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:28.500
down.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.916
People have still
been complaining

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.440
about the noise in class.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
All right, so a redox
reaction, a chemical reaction

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.250
that involves an
exchange of electrons.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.640
And so we saw what happens when
we mix this with some dry ice.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.870
All right, so let's
do some definitions.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.500
We always start units
with definitions.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.470
And most of you know some of
these definitions already.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.330
Oxidation, electron loss.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.540
Reduction, electrons are gained.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.590
This one you may or may
not be familiar with.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.780
Oxidizing agent, it
accepts electrons.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.360
So it oxidizes other things,
but it itself is reduced.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.530
And reducing agent
donates electrons.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.930
It reduces other things.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.570
It itself is oxidized.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.910
And before you turn
the page, I just

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.190
want to try to get you to
remember these two terms.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.640
So one way that I
like to think about it

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.130
is that a reducing
agent might be somebody

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.620
who is a little bit shady.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.890
They might walk up to someone
and say, in a crowded space,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.272
don't look at me, just listen.

00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:48.420
Do you want to buy an electron?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.960
So that would be an agent
of reduction going around.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.720
Now, there could be ones
that are a little bit

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.210
shady, selling electrons
to the highest bidder.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.720
But there could also
be agents of good.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.220
I told you about
free radical species.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.400
There's a lot of free
radicals in the universe.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.870
They can be dangerous
because they

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.510
have a single, unpaired
electron, which makes

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.660
them really highly reactive.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.970
So there might be an agent,
a secret agent of oxidation.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.170
And it might want to shield
the universe from the power

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.030
of free radicals.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.980
And so it will go along
and it would oxidize that,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.365
take that electron
away and oxidize

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:35.370
and become reduced itself,
take that free radical away.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.321
Because the free radical species
might not know how dangerous

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:38.820
it is.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.660
It's for everybody's good to
shield you from that power.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.700
You might also have
an agent of reduction

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.350
that's a secret
agent, that might

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.920
go up to the free
radical species

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.170
and give it an extra electron.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.130
And then it has two.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.710
And then it's more
stable and less reactive.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.434
So you might have these agents.

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:56.100
So that's how you
should think about it.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.720
Think about an
agent of oxidation

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.870
wants to go out and oxidize
for the good of mankind,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.600
or an agent of reduction that
wants to go out and reduce

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.460
other things.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.030
So that might help you
remember those definitions.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.440
We'll hope so.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.750
All right, so let's take
a look now-- we always

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.240
start every unit
with definitions,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.460
and then we have a set
of rules and guidelines.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.360
So let's take a look
at the guidelines.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.470
Luckily, these guidelines are
really pretty straightforward.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.200
And you really shouldn't have a
lot of difficulty keeping them

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.310
in mind.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.280
Some of them we've
really seen already,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.880
we just didn't
realize that they were

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.440
going to be the guidelines
that we would have.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.520
So guidelines for assigning
oxidation numbers--

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.990
in a free element, every
atom has an oxidation number

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.760
of zero.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.980
OK, that seems pretty
straightforward.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.190
H2, oxidation number, zero.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.580
Rule two-- ions composed
of only one atom,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.600
also called monatomic ions,
have an oxidation number

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.530
that's equal to their charge.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.130
If this wasn't true, it
would be deeply disturbing.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.420
Lithium plus 1 ions has an
oxidation number of plus 1.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.280
I think we're good.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.220
Also in number two,
in forming compounds,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.150
compounds Group 1 metals
have an oxidation number

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.890
of plus 1, lithium and all of
its friends, sodium, et cetera.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.690
Group 2 metals have an oxidation
number of plus 2-- calcium

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.130
for example.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.820
And aluminum is plus
3 in its compounds.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.040
This is also something
that we've seen before.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.100
Those Group 1 and Group 2 metals
are not all that exciting.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.550
They pretty much want to get
their noble gas configuration

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.340
and they want it to lose either
one, if you're in Group 1,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.860
or two electrons if
you're in Group 2.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.987
And so that's what they do here.

00:06:50.987 --> 00:06:52.820
So this is good to keep
in mind because it's

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.370
going to help you
figure out the oxidation

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.710
number of other elements
for which there are not

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.480
such hard and fast rules.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.440
Number three, oxygen-- oxygen
in most compounds is minus 2.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.840
Again, not that surprising
that it would want

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.610
to gain those two electrons.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.160
However, there's
some exceptions.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.580
Oxygen is just an element
full of exceptions.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.970
If it is in peroxides-- hydrogen
peroxide, O2, 2 minus-- then

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.720
it's going to have an
oxidation number of minus 1.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.740
So peroxides, and later we'll
see superoxides are exceptions.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.520
But if it's not a
peroxide or a superoxide,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.260
it's going to be minus 2.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.830
All right, rule number
four, hydrogen-- hydrogen

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.280
is mostly plus 1.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.910
You probably could guess that.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.675
But there actually are
some exceptions for this.

00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:52.300
And you're going to see a lot of
those exceptions in this unit,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.530
and pretty much after this
unit, not so much ever again.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.870
The exceptions are for the
Group 1 and the Group 2.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.970
So the Group 1 and Group
2 rules supersede the fact

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.160
that hydrogen is usually plus 1.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.530
So if you have
hydrogen with lithium,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.390
lithium is going to be plus 1.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.060
So hydrogen will be minus. one.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.560
Sodium is the same here.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.510
And calcium, that's Group 2.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.890
Again, hydrogen
would be minus 1.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.660
So Group 1, Group 2
rules supersede hydrogen.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.400
All right, what
about our halides?

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.780
We have fluorine.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.774
It wants to be minus 1.

00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:33.820
Other halogens--
chloride, bromide,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.770
iodide-- are negative
when they are in salts,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.809
such as sodium chloride.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.980
But if oxygen is
there, the oxygen rules

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.730
are the ones that follow.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.950
So here, if you
have Cl with oxygen,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.770
then you're going to
have a positive oxidation

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.380
number for the
chlorine, because oxygen

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.400
is going to be minus two.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.180
And you'll see a number of
these so-called oxyacids

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.700
in this unit.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.780
All right, six-- this one,
you probably already know.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:17.080
But in a neutral molecule, the
sums of the oxidation numbers

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.450
must equal zero.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.230
So the sums must be neutral
if the molecule is neutral.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.870
And if you have something that
is a polyatomic multiatom ion,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.720
the sum of the individual
oxidation numbers

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.250
needs to be equal to the
overall charge on that ion.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.040
So again, we've seen
things like this before.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.740
So we should have no
trouble with these words.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.550
OK, so let's just look
at an example of this.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.230
Suppose we have our
friend NH4 plus.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.710
What is hydrogen's
oxidation number going to be

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.700
in this molecule?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.680
It will be plus one.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.800
So it's not with a Group
1 or Group 2 element,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.810
so it's going to be plus 1.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.920
What about nitrogen?

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.480
There were no rules
about nitrogen,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.180
so we have to figure out
based on the other rules what

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.261
the oxidation number
of nitrogen will be.

00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:12.427
What is it going to be here?

00:10:12.427 --> 00:10:13.327
AUDIENCE: Minus 3.

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.160
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It's
going to be minus 3.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.090
And the reason for that
is because of the rule

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.290
we just talked about, that the
sum of the oxidation numbers

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.690
needs to be equal to the
charge on the molecule.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.440
The charge is plus 1.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.230
So we have four hydrogens,
4 plus 1 minus 3

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.640
is going to equal plus 1.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.370
So nitrogen would
have to be minus 3.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.330
Nitrogen can have a lot
of different numbers,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.140
so you want to pay attention
to what's around it

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.940
and whether there are
rules or guidelines

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.000
about those other elements.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.320
All right, seven,
oxidation numbers

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.180
don't have to be integers.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.320
They almost always are, but
there is one notable exception,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.160
and it's from oxygen.
Perhaps not a surprise,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.820
oxygen is always
causing trouble.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:07.600
So in superoxide,
you have O2 minus 1.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.140
So what is the oxidation
number on each oxygen

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.840
in that O2 minus one molecule?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.040
Yep, so it's minus 1/2.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.390
So oxygen is usually minus
2 except in peroxides

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.910
and superoxides.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.680
All right, so let's take
a look at some examples.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.100
And I'll write some
of these on the board.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860
And here are all of your rules.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.770
So you can yell
out what you think

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.710
I should be doing with
these as we go along.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.860
OK, so we have lithium 2 oxide.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.350
So here we know
a lot about this.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.090
What's the oxygen
going to be-- minus 2.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.630
The overall charge on
the molecule is zero.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.100
And we have two lithiums.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.810
And what's the
charge on each one?

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.790
AUDIENCE: Plus 1.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.330
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Plus 1.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.260
And so plus 2 minus 2 is 0.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.130
Great.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.920
Let's do another one.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.150
We'll do PCl5 next.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.100
So what do we know about Cl?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.045
What charge do we expect here?

00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:21.160
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.030
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Minus 1,
and there are five of those.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.660
So chlorine likes to be minus 1.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.960
Exception is with oxygen, but
it's not with oxygen here.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.200
The overall charge is going
to be zero, because it's

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.820
a neutral molecule.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.020
So what does that mean about
the charge on our phosphorous?

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.520
AUDIENCE: Plus 5.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.600
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Plus 5, right.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.045
OK, so now let's try HNO3.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.340
So let's do oxygen first.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.140
What charge do we
expect on oxygen?

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.715
AUDIENCE: Minus 2.

00:12:57.715 --> 00:12:58.840
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Minus 2.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.590
So we have three
of those minus 2.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.750
Overall this is
going to be zero.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.260
Nitrogen can be varied,
so let's do hydrogen. What

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.120
do we expect hydrogen to be?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.050
AUDIENCE: Plus 1.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.425
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Plus 1, right,

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.620
because it's not in
Group 1 or Group 2.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.990
So what does that
leave for nitrogen?

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.932
AUDIENCE: Plus 5.

00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:20.760
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Plus 5.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:27.000
So we have plus 6
then minus 6 is 0.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.610
All right, so why don't
you try the next one

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.490
as a clicker question.

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.445
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.930
So oxygen is minus 2.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.830
It's not in a peroxide
or a superoxide.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.930
The overall charge is zero.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.460
So that means that each
nitrogen must be plus 1.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.070
So we have plus 2 minus 2 is 0.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.950
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.950
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.542
AUDIENCE: What
exactly is a peroxide?

00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:24.980
CATHERINE DRENNAN: A peroxide--
so there really only goes

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.230
the hydrogen peroxide example.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.490
So it'll say that it's a
peroxide, or a superoxide.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.540
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.498
It's going to be clear.

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.920
OK, good.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.320
So now let's talk
about some reactions

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.140
that involve oxidations
and reductions.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.240
And to talk about
these reactions you

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.250
need to know how to do this.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.190
And then we're going to talk
about balancing reactions.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.230
And you need all
of these skills.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.840
All right, so first I just want
to tell you about something

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.240
called the
disproportionation reaction

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.340
where you have one element
that is going to be

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.200
both oxidized and reduced.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.870
And this is a good
example to allow

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.490
us to think about
what's happening

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.390
in a different reaction.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.650
So in this reaction,
the element that

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.600
is going to be both
oxidized and reduced is Cl.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.240
Sodium is going to
be a spectator ion.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.950
And the oxygen is going to
stay in its minus 2 form here.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.060
And so we have chlorine going
to chlorine in this compound

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.110
and in this compound.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.500
So we can break
this down and think

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.190
about what's happening with
this species going to this,

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.640
and then also going to Cl minus.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.420
So let's think about what the
oxidation number of chlorine

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.300
is in ClO minus.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.680
So first, oxygen, I already told
you, is going to be minus 2.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.770
The overall charge on
the molecule is minus 1.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.630
So chlorine has to make
this equation work.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.030
So what is the
oxidation number of Cl?

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:11.820
AUDIENCE: Plus 1.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.690
AUDIENCE: Plus 1, thank you.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.270
So yeah, plus 1 here.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.130
Now let's take a look at this.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.295
So oxygen, we're going
to have as minus 2.

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:23.930
There are three of them.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.440
That's going to equal,
overall, minus 1.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.284
So what's the oxidation
number of chlorine here?

00:16:30.284 --> 00:16:31.616
AUDIENCE: Plus 5.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.140
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Plus 5, right.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.350
So we have a case
now where we're

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.980
going from plus 1 to plus 5.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.700
Is that an oxidation
or a reduction?

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.000
That's an oxidation.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.700
So we're increasing the number.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.440
It is losing electrons.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.960
It's becoming oxidized.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.100
So down here, we already
have done all of our work

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.490
and know that this is
also going to be plus 1.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:04.890
So in this case, we're going
from plus 1 to minus 1.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.109
Is that an oxidation
or a reduction?

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.099
AUDIENCE: Reduction.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:08.796
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
That's a reduction,

00:17:08.796 --> 00:17:10.720
and that's good
because it wouldn't

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.359
be a very good
disproportionation

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.040
reaction otherwise.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.450
Something has to be oxidized.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.190
Same thing has to be
oxidized and reduced.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.839
So this is how you think
about this type of reaction.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.420
So to consider
whether something's

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.579
being oxidized or
reduced, you need

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:32.100
to be able to dissect out what
the oxidation numbers are.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.670
All right, now we're
going to balance.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.950
So balancing is going
to become very important

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.540
for doing problems later on,
balancing redox reactions.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.980
You balance
differently if you're

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.590
in acidic conditions
versus basic conditions.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.370
So first we're going to
do acidic conditions.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.040
And we're going to run through
the steps for doing this.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.070
First step is we're
going to write two half

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.720
reactions for this.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.397
So we have iron in here and
we have chromium in here,

00:18:03.397 --> 00:18:04.980
and we're going to
separate those out.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.490
So we're going to think about
what iron is doing separately

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.980
from what the chromium is doing.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.450
So first, let's write
out our chromium

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.210
and think about what is
happening to it here.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.560
And that is a clicker question.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.180
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.910
OK, so let's take a look
at why two is correct.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.672
For one thing, you just have
to remember the definitions.

00:18:53.672 --> 00:18:55.380
For another, you have
to recognize what's

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.480
happening to the chromium.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.390
So let's take a look
at the chromium now.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.240
So we have oxygen at minus 2.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.900
There's seven of them.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.700
And the overall charge on
the molecule is minus 2.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.920
And so what does that
mean for the oxidation

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.581
number of this chromium?

00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:15.443
AUDIENCE: Plus 6.

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:16.901
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It's going to be

00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:20.750
plus 6, because we're going
to have 12 minus 14 equals

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.090
minus 2.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:28.600
So we're going from plus 6
over here to plus 3 here.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.060
So is that an
oxidation or reduction?

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.910
So that's a reduction.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.120
So I kind of like this unit
coming after acids and bases

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.190
because a lot of those
problems, I think,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.140
make people's brains
hurt a little bit.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.290
And you get here and
it's, like, basic math.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.120
So it's kind of exciting.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.550
All right, so the
iron is even simpler.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.910
We're going from
plus 2 to plus 3.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.920
So that's an oxidation.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.080
So one thing is being reduced.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.880
The other thing
is being oxidized.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.280
That's what makes
it a redox reaction.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.280
All right, so we
know what's happening

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.150
in terms of what's being
oxidized, what's being reduced.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.760
And we've broken these
into half reactions.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.402
Now we need to balance.

00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:17.360
All right, so the first
thing we're going to do

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.630
is we're going to balance
our elements that are not

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.710
oxygen and hydrogen. So we're
going to balance chromium

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.200
and we're going to
balance our iron.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.390
What do we need to add to
this top to balance chromium?

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.680
We need to add a 2.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.450
And we don't need to do
anything to our iron.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.350
We have one iron on one side,
one iron on the other side.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.160
All right, so all you need
to do is insert the 2.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.260
Next step, we're going to
add water to balance oxygen.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.940
So how much water do we need
to add to the top reaction

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.155
to balance the oxygen?

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:07.560
So here we're going to add seven
waters to balance the oxygen.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.120
And again, we have
nothing to do down there.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.440
All, right, so let's keep going.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.350
Next, we want to
balance the hydrogen.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.780
We're just added those waters.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.970
And so now we have
to balance hydrogen.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.390
So we're going to balance the
hydrogen by adding H plus.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.760
Some books have you
balance the hydrogen

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.070
by adding a more
correct species, which

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.660
is hydronium ion.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.810
But when you do that,
you screw up your oxygens

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.400
that you just balanced.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.810
So that is infinitely harder
to balance equations that way.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.210
So I say let's not do that.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.970
So let's just use H plus.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.670
So how many H pluses
do we need to add over

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.840
here to balance the hydrogen?

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.410
14-- you've added 14.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.150
And again, you don't
have to do anything

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.430
to the bottom expression.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.020
Next, we are going
to balance the charge

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.090
by inserting electrons.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.350
So over here we have
14 minus 2 plus 12.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.750
And over here we have plus 6.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.814
So how many electrons are
we going to need to add?

00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:21.190
We're going to need to add six.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.740
So we've added six
over here, because they

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.450
have a negative charge.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.730
So now we should be
balanced on both sides.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.700
And now we finally
get to do something

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.620
with the bottom expression.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.890
And we can add an electron over
here to balance the charge.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.730
So plus 2 here, plus 2
net on the other side.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:50.900
All right, now we want to
multiply so that the electrons

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.990
are going to cancel.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.230
Because this is an overall
oxidation-reduction reaction,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.510
our electrons should cancel.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.170
So what do we need to multiply
the bottom equation by?

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:10.130
6, and there we go-- 6
here, 6 here, and 6 here.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.330
Now this is one of the places
that people often, in exams,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.080
make a mistake
where they write 6

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.020
and then put a parentheses
around it indicating

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.330
that you're multiplying
the whole thing by 6,

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.290
which is fine.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.050
But then they forget to
actually carry that out

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.380
on the next step.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.270
So when you multiply, make
sure that you continue

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.060
to-- sometimes it's better
to just write it all out,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.390
because otherwise it's
really easy to forget and not

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.210
multiply, and then things
won't make sense at the end.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.270
All right, so now we can
add the half reactions

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.150
and make the appropriate
cancellations.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.070
So we've now added all together
six electrons, 14 H plus.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.800
We have our chromium
oxide compound.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.290
We have now our six iron plus
2s, our two chromium plus 3s,

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.940
our seven waters, our six iron
plus 3s, and our six electrons.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.900
And if we did everything
right, then the electrons

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.650
should cancel.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.776
And we can double check.

00:24:11.776 --> 00:24:13.400
It's always a good
idea to double check

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.750
that it's balanced.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.010
So we have 14 H's
here, 14 H's there.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.960
Chromium two, two.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.910
Oxygen seven, seven.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.530
Iron, six, six.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.180
This can catch a mistake
that you might have made.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.860
And then check the
charge-- plus 14, minus 2,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.080
plus 12 on one side.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:39.790
Plus 6, plus 18, so
24 on both sides.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:40.895
That's pretty good, right?

00:24:40.895 --> 00:24:41.770
That's pretty simple.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.390
So balancing.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.440
That's an acidic solution.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.460
We know it's in acidic
because we have 14 H plus.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.290
That feels quite acidic.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.170
What do you do for a
basic solution now?

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.770
So for a basic solution
what I recommend is just

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.940
do the exact same thing that you
did for your acidic solution.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.730
And here again was the
answer that we have.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:09.910
And then, quote, neutralize
the acid and make it basic.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:15.250
Adjust your pH by adding
OH minus or hydroxide iron

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.050
concentration to each side.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.930
So if we do that
now, we're going

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:26.830
to add 14 OH minus to this side
and 14 OH minus to that side.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.910
Now 14 OH minus
plus 14 H plus are

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.640
going to give us 14 water
molecules over here.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.010
And on this side we
still have 14 OH.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.520
This is not simplified, because
we have 14 waters on one side

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.290
and seven on the other side.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.480
So we can take that,
cancel out these seven.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.830
And we have seven
left over here.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.460
So we have seven
waters now on one side

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.470
and 14 hydroxides on the other.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.150
So if we look at both of these
expressions in acidic solution

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.450
and in basic solution
here, in acidic solution

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.530
we have 14 H plus on one side
and seven waters on the other.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.650
In basic we have seven
waters on this side and 14 OH

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:12.910
minus on this side.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.780
Everything else
should be the same,

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.450
and they should all add up.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.480
All right, so there we go.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.300
That is balancing
oxidation-reductions.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.000
It seems really straightforward,
but it's very important.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.130
We'll see next week that we
need to use this information

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.860
to be able to do problems.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.030
All right, so end of 14.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.630
Now to electrochemistry--
so today's handout.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.640
So we're talking about
oxidation-reduction.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.490
We're continuing talking
about oxidation-reduction.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.020
I just want to
remind you how really

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.770
important oxidation-reduction
reactions are.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.230
So we've talked about
photosynthesis in this class.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.210
We've talked about fuel cells.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.660
All of these reactions
that make energy involve

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.140
oxidation-reduction, loss of
electrons, gain of electrons.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.230
Basically the human
body is a big battery.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.510
We have lots of
oxidation-reduction reactions

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.890
going on inside of us.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.450
This is how we live.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.900
This is how we make energy.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.410
This is how we survive.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.470
All right, so
electrochemistry is the study

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.760
of redox reactions,
usually thinking about how

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.640
they occur at an electrode.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.280
So there are two
types of reactions

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.860
that you will be considering.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.160
You might be considering
a reaction that

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.170
generates an electric current,
electron flow, or electricity,

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.110
from a spontaneous reaction.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.630
And you might
consider one where you

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.200
need to drive a reaction
that is nonspontaneous

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.280
using an electric current.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.880
So a spontaneous
reaction, delta G

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.058
is what, positive or negative?

00:27:54.058 --> 00:27:55.372
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:27:55.372 --> 00:27:56.540
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Right.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.580
So a spontaneous reaction,
delta G is negative.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.080
It's less than zero.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.530
A nonspontaneous
reaction is positive.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.450
Just a little review
there for exam three.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:16.460
All right, so electrochemistry,
study of these redox reactions.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.030
Electrochemical
cells are devices

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:25.280
where you generate electrons
and they flow through the cell.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.000
And so you have the flow of
electrons through a circuit.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.140
And again, that can be generated
by a spontaneous reaction.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.740
And if it is generated by
a spontaneous reaction,

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.410
that's called a galvanic cell.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.420
Or you can use an
electric current

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.360
to force a nonspontaneous
reaction to go.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.730
And that's called an
electrolytic cell.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.920
And it's important to
remember those definitions

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.440
because a lot of
problems tell you,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.510
oh, in this electrolytic cell.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.420
And that's telling you key
information about what's

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.980
going on in that problem.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.130
So if you don't have these
committed to memories,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.780
you will find
yourself in trouble.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.780
But it's not too
bad, just two terms.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.860
So a battery then-- so
I have a battery here.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.837
A battery is a collection
of galvanic cells.

00:29:12.837 --> 00:29:14.420
And it's going to
give us-- it's going

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.800
to use spontaneous reactions
to give us electric current.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.600
And again, electrodes,
the definition for those,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.330
they're just the
conductors through which

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.310
the electrons travel.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.180
And there are two types.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.330
Let's quiet down again.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.780
I hear the noise.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.280
Two types of electrodes--
we have anodes and cathodes.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.270
All right, so let's look
at an electrochemical cell

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.250
and consider, again, the
anodes and the cathodes.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.650
So this is my
beautiful depiction

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.110
of an electrochemical cell.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.630
This might be a better
depiction of what it looks like,

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.689
but I think mine is not bad.

00:29:54.689 --> 00:29:56.230
Just to help you
out, that's supposed

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.990
to be a beaker that
has fluid in it.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.600
This is also a beaker
that has fluid in it.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.670
And this is my electrode.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.380
That is an anode in this case.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.979
There is the anode there,
the electrode there.

00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:09.770
Here's another one.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.100
That's the cathode,
another type of electrode.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.450
It's over here.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.250
This is my salt bridge.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.920
The salt bridge here
is this plastic tube.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.680
And here I have a wire
connecting my electrodes here.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.600
And you can't
really see the wire.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.810
But in both cases it goes
through some kind of volt meter

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.280
that measures the
electric current.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.070
All right, so now we get
rid of this better picture.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.740
But you can think about this
pictures or that picture

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.790
if that helps.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.800
And I always like
to joke that you

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.469
think you have a bad here
at MIT, in the old days,

00:30:40.469 --> 00:30:42.510
before you could do your
problem set at 2 o'clock

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.030
in the morning you had to
build your own batteries

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.040
to be able to do it.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:54.450
All right, so anode-- electrons
are produced from oxidation

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:55.530
at the anode.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:01.240
So the electrons produced
here flow out of the cell.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.640
And in this particular type
of electrochemical cell,

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.010
zinc solid is oxidized
to zinc plus 2.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.720
So if we look at
this over here, this

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.390
is my little beautiful
depiction of the blow

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.610
up of the electrode.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.650
We have our zinc solid here.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.860
And we have zinc plus
2 in aqueous solution.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:26.630
So when the electrons
leave the zinc solid,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.990
so that the zinc then
leaves the electrode

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.780
and goes into solution,
forming zinc plus 2,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.820
those electrons go out.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.390
So the electrons will
then go into the cathode.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.340
And notice I had a
typo in the handout.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.401
I find this pretty funny.

00:31:41.401 --> 00:31:43.400
I don't know if it's me
or spellcheck right now.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.630
I wrote elections are consumed.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.440
Oh man, it's been a long week,
between the national elections

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.700
and our T-shirt elections.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.510
Anyway, I didn't mean elections.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.280
I meant electrons.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.550
Yes, of course,
electrons are consumed

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.950
by a reduction reaction.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.720
Of course I noticed that after I
had printed hundreds of copies.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.860
And this particular
reaction here, copper plus 2

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.110
is reduced to copper solid.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.850
And if we look over
here, we have copper

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.670
plus 2 in aqueous solution.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.140
When two electrons come
in, those two electrons

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.010
go to the copper plus 2 and
reduce it to copper solid.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.510
And the copper solid actually
plates on the electrode.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.880
So we can measure the flow.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.410
We can have a
meter that measures

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.110
the volts or the
flow of electrons,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.790
the electric current.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.890
And also what's that
salt bridge doing?

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.010
Well, the salt bridge
can help maintain

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.960
the neutrality in the system.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.540
Because over here, we're
generating plus charge.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.990
And over here we're
losing plus charge.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.050
And so ions can flow
through the salt bridge

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.770
and keep the charges
more similar in our two

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.880
different beakers.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.240
All right, so I know my
pictures are gorgeous,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.040
but I have a little animation
to show you that will also

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.570
show you what I
was talking about,

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.326
oxidation at the electrode.

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:20.820
Zinc solid is going to lose
electrons and form zinc plus 2.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.830
And let me just show
you that happening.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.350
So there are the
electrons going away.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:31.210
And here is zinc popping
off as zinc plus 2.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.630
And then the zinc plus 2
is going to be in solution.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.000
So there the electrons go again.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.700
And the zinc solid pops
off as zinc plus 2.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.490
All right, so now let's consider
reduction at the cathode.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.550
So here we have
our copper solid.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.920
Here we have a copper plus 2.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.720
And here the electrons are
going to come in and join up

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.460
with our copper plus 2.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.466
And it's going to plate
onto the electrode.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.370
There come the electrons.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.730
There they come again.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.830
And now we have added solid
copper to our electrode.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.830
And just one more
time-- and I think

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.690
it's so cool that
we can just watch

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.536
those electrons move like that.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.679
All right, so there's
our electrochemical cell

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:31.210
where we have an oxidation
and reduction reaction.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.690
Instead of drawing this
admittedly beautiful picture

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.110
every time, we can have a
shorthand representation

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.100
for this.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:44.080
So we can say zinc solid.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.540
And then we have a
little line here.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.320
That little line indicates
we have a phase boundary.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.210
So that means we're going from
solid to a different phase.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.659
And in this case we're going
to aqueous, so solid zinc

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.880
to zinc plus 2.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.360
The two lines here
indicate the salt bridge.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.360
So this tells us that
the reaction on this side

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.060
is in one beaker, and
the reaction on this side

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.590
is in our other beaker.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.030
The reaction in
the other side is

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.920
copper plus 2 aqueous, a single
line for phase boundary going

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.220
to copper solid.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.160
Now if we had, say,
two aqueous species,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.870
we wouldn't have
a phase boundary,

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.380
we'd just have a comma.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.400
But if you have a phase
boundary, you get the line.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.100
All right, so it's a
clicker competition.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.740
Let's consider another cell.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.680
It still has zinc,
but now it has tin.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.890
Why don't you tell me which
reaction is at the anode

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.450
and which reaction
is at the cathode?

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.120
And also, which of
those is oxidation

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.300
and which is reductions?

00:35:58.357 --> 00:36:00.065
All right, we'll just
do 10 more seconds.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.330
Great.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.900
OK, so some of these
had parts of it right,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.980
but there was a mistake.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.920
We have AnOx, so that is wrong.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.040
So you had to pay attention
to whether these match,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.190
and then also that the
reaction is written consistent

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.880
with the word.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.800
So only number two had all the
various different parts right.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.510
So we can come back
here and you can

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.710
enter-- so the reaction at
the anode was a zinc reaction.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.020
And that is an oxidation, AnOx.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.870
The reaction at the cathode
is the tin reaction.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.380
Tin plus 4, two electrons,
tin plus 2 aqueous.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.540
And that's a reduction.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.870
And while you have your
clickers out, why don't you

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.870
tell me how you would represent
that electrochemical cell?

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.840
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.150
So right.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.490
So I mentioned
this very briefly.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.500
This was my tricky
clicker question,

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.880
because it's a competition.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:47.170
So there's no phase transition
here, so you have a comma.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:52.510
And the top one a few people put
down, but it's not solid here.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:56.050
So that one is not correct.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.240
So here you can write
down in your notes,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.970
you have this zinc
phase transition,

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.890
zinc plus 2 aqueous.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.390
And then we have our
salt bridge, zinc

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:11.500
plus 4 aqueous comma per zinc,
tin plus 4 comma, tine plus 2.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.910
And now we're ready for winners.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.296
We'll see if Sam's also
ready to present the winners.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:31.380
All right, we need a strategy
to defeat Dan's recitation,

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.970
but we know what T-shirt
we're playing for now.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.290
All right, have a great
weekend everybody.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.380
All right, let's just
take 10 more seconds.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.120
All right, does
someone want to tell me

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.585
how they got the right answer?

00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:13.958
Yep?

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.747
AUDIENCE: You know that your
hydrogen will have a plus 1

00:39:22.747 --> 00:39:24.830
charge, and your oxygen
will have a minus 2 charge

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.520
because it's not a peroxide.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.830
And you know your sum
is going to be neutral.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.226
So you add one.

00:39:30.226 --> 00:39:32.700
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yep, that's right.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.870
So this one, chlorine
is usually minus 1.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.940
The exception is when
it's with oxygen.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.910
And so oxygen is always
minus 2 unless it's

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.970
in a peroxide or superoxide.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.220
And hydrogen's always
plus 1 except when

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.960
it's with a metal like sodium,
something Group 1 or Group 2.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.800
OK, so today take
out lecture 25 notes.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.610
We're just going to
wrap those notes up--

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.410
that shouldn't take
too long-- and then

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.955
keep going with lecture 26.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.150
So we were talking
about this cell.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.520
And we're going to talk about
this electrochemical cell

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.950
a lot.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:14.810
So we had zinc on one
side, zinc at the anode.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:19.940
And the zinc was being oxidized,
generating electrons, which

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.830
come around to the copper.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.590
And then the copper
plus 2 ions were

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.840
being reduced to copper solid.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.710
So the zinc anode
was being consumed.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.370
And the copper cathode
had copper solid being

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.140
plated onto it.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.530
So Faraday's law
says that the amount

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.460
in which an anode, like
the zinc anode, is consumed

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.870
and the amount of copper that
gets plated on at the cathode

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.020
is proportional to the charge
that passes through the system.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.010
So according to
Faraday's law, there

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.540
is a proportionality
between the consumption

00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.520
and also depositing of metal
and the amount of charge

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.080
going through the system.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.790
So we can think about
how much zinc is consumed

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:15.230
and how much copper is deposited
on its cathode or its electrode

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.430
if you have a current of
1 amp flowing for 1 hour.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.700
So let's just take a look at
how we do a problem like this.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.220
First step is we
want to think about,

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.100
calculate the charge that's
going through the system.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.710
And so Q here, we have another
Q-- not the reaction quotient,

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.330
but the magnitude of the charge.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.160
And that's in coulombs.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.620
And that's going to be equal
to the current times the time.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.210
So we have the current, I.
And the current is in amps.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.950
And t is in seconds.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:49.860
And conveniently, amps
equal coulombs per second.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.350
So this equation works out.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.540
Our units will work out.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.580
So Q is going to be equal
to-- we have 1.0 amps.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.720
And it was 1 hour, so
that's 3,600 seconds,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:09.620
or 3,600 coulombs, because
we have an amp times second.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.180
And then here, we have
this number of coulombs.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.690
And now we want to convert
to the number of moles

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.620
of electrons that that is
equivalent to, that that charge

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.690
in coulombs is equivalent to.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.280
And here, our Faraday's constant
is our conversion factor.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:35.090
So Faraday's constant, we
have 96,485 coulombs per mole

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.590
is one faraday.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.720
And its this kind of
funny looking F over here.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.390
So we have our coulombs.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:45.830
So we can use now the
Faraday's constant to convert.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:50.580
And we get 0.00373
moles of electrons.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.550
So that's the number
of moles of electrons

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.880
that would be going through
our system that correspond

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.500
to that amount of charge.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.550
All right, so now we
need to relate this back

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.860
to the zinc and the copper.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.630
So step three, we
want to know first

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.960
the number of moles of the
zinc and copper involved,

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.810
and then convert that to grams
because the problem asked us

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.610
for grams.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.980
So we have the number of
moles of electrons that

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.730
are going through the system.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.050
And so for every one
mole of zinc consumed,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.500
how many electrons
go into the system?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.938
What's the ratio, one,
two-- how many electrons?

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:29.162 --> 00:43:35.094
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So one zinc
solid going to one zinc plus.

00:43:35.094 --> 00:43:35.822
AUDIENCE: Two

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:36.780
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.870
So that's going to be
two moles of electrons.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.390
And then we need to look
up, how are we going

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:49.162
to convert our moles to grams?

00:43:49.162 --> 00:43:50.120
What are we looking up?

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.770
AUDIENCE: Molar mass.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.680
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep,
molar mass, molecular weight,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680
atomic mass.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.590
So in our periodic
table, grams per mole.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:08.290
And so we get 1.2 grams
here for this equation.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.440
All right, so for copper,
so we have the same number

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.440
of moles of electrons that
are going through the system.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.860
So for every one
mole of copper solid

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.510
deposited on its electrode,
how many moles of electrons

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.100
have to come into the system?

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.600
Louder?

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.270
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.610
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two, yes.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.980
So that's two as well.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.180
And then we look up again,
in the periodic table,

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.210
the atomic weight,
molecular weight.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.370
And it's almost the
same, copper and zinc.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.030
So to the number of
significant figures

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.280
it's the same amount of grams.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.690
Now this will not
always be the case.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.480
They're just very
close to each other

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.100
in their molecular
or atomic weight.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.560
OK, so we have two
significant figures.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.230
Also our current in time only
had two significant figures.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.820
So we only have two significant
figures in this problem.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.880
All right, so in this
particular electrochemical cell,

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.210
again, our anode
is being consumed

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.570
and the electrons
that were generated

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.760
ended up plating the copper on.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.040
Sometimes you're not
going to want to do that.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.400
Sometimes you're just going
to want to actually plate

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.960
something with
copper, for example.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.200
And so let's look
at some of the uses

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.030
for this kind of chemistry.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.920
So here's some electroplating.

00:45:31.474 --> 00:45:32.140
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.640
- This steel spoon will
have a thin coating

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.920
of copper deposited on it.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.560
The cell consists of an
anode of pure copper,

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.850
a solution of copper sulfate,
and as a cathode, a spoon.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.500
There is no net reaction.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.066
The copper metal is transferred
from the anode to the cathode.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.607
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It's pretty nice.

00:45:56.607 --> 00:45:57.190
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.970
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
OK, so is kind

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.700
of electroplating is
pretty common where

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.850
you use these kind of reactions
to get your copper, which

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:11.120
is in that solution, to plate
as copper solid onto something.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.529
So it could be a spoon.

00:46:12.529 --> 00:46:13.570
It could be an electrode.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.069
Yeah?

00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:15.680
AUDIENCE: Why is it dangerous?

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.420
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Why is it dangerous?

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.400
You know, I've seen
these demos before,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.220
so I think that's
just like security

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.970
[INAUDIBLE] to say that.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.100
I don't think it's
incredibly dangerous frankly,

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.170
but I probably
shouldn't say that.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.836
I'll get myself in
all sorts of trouble.

00:46:30.836 --> 00:46:31.830
Don't try this at home.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.702
I don't know why.

00:46:33.702 --> 00:46:35.910
AUDIENCE: Usually when you're
doing jewelery plating,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.850
the chemicals that you
use are relatively toxic.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.990
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
but not that much worse

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.900
than the lab stuff.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.950
Allena makes jewelry, so
she knows all about this.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.550
But she does it very
safely-- very safely.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.550
All right, so let's look
at a couple other kinds

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:52.570
of electrodes.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.950
It is not always the case
that an electrode is consumed

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.040
or that an electrode gets
stuff deposited on it.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.320
Some electrodes are inert.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.380
An example for this is
a platinum electrode.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.490
It is inert.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.080
So it doesn't get
consumed and it

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.070
doesn't get reacted onto
during the reaction.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:15.530
And so here's an example
of a cell that uses this.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.940
So over here now we have
still our copper system.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.870
So this is our cathode,
again, over here.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.480
And a cathode does what,
oxidation or reduction?

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.476
AUDIENCE: Reduction.

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.100
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
There's a reduction.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.680
And so this is our
same reaction, copper

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.140
plus 2, two electrodes,
coated copper solid.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.950
So this is doing
the plating again.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.270
But this time it's different.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.390
Before we have the
zinc on an electrode

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.950
that was being consumed.

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.200
But now we have this platinum.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.780
And the reaction that happens
at the anode-- it's still

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.540
an oxidation, always an
oxidation at the anode.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.510
But the oxidation
reaction is chromium

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:54.780
plus 2 going to chromium
plus 3 and an electron.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.450
So here, the electrode is
inert, and the reaction

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.520
is all happening
in the same phase,

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.600
all happening in solution.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:10.020
So we can also write the
notation for this kind of cell.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.100
And so here we would
have platinum solid,

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.180
the single line, which
means the phase difference.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:19.530
Chromium plus 2 aqueous
comma, because now there's

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:24.060
not a phase transition between
these, a chromium plus 3

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.050
aqueous.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.700
The two lines, that means what?

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.773
What do those mean again?

00:48:28.773 --> 00:48:29.760
AUDIENCE: Salt bridge.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.650
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Salt bridge.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.480
So this indicates
that's one beaker.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.070
This is the other beaker.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.200
And here we have the
copper plus 2 aqueous,

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.520
single line for phase
change and a copper solid.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.335
So again, our anode reaction
and our cathode reaction.

00:48:44.335 --> 00:48:46.990
All right, so this
is another kind.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.440
You can also use platinum
electrodes in combination

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.100
with what's known as
a hydrogen electrode.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.340
So these are often together,
the platinum with the hydrogen.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.270
And many reduction potentials--
and when you get problem set

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.340
eight, you're going to be
looking up in your book

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.160
a lot of standard
reduction potentials.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.720
And many of them will
say, measured against SHE.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.450
And a lot of people
say, who is this SHE

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.730
that measures all
of these potentials

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:16.960
in the back of books?

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.710
And that SHE is a standard
hydrogen electrode.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.480
All right, so let's
think about how

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.160
this electrode is being used.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:32.290
So when it's used as a cathode,
we have H plus aqueous phase

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.520
transition to H2 gas, and
then another phase transition

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.580
to our solid platinum
inert electrode.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.830
And here when it's
used as a cathode,

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:45.040
H plus is being reduced.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.850
But it can also be
used as an anode.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.560
And this is a clicker question.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.050
Why didn't you tell me
what would be happening

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.900
when the hydrogen
platinum electrode is

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.870
being used as an
anode, or reaction's

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.628
being used an an anode?

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.160
10 Seconds.

00:50:17.936 --> 00:50:21.650
Let's see if you can
get 90%-- 89, 89%.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.700
Oh, far away.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.040
That is the right answer though.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.400
So some of these,
platinum is inert,

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.530
so it's not doing anything.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:37.400
And it's over here.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.710
So it's not doing anything.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.100
So we can rule
out all the things

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.200
that platinum are doing stuff.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.350
All right, H plus being
oxidized-- you ever

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:48.150
heard of H2 plus?

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.030
No, so we don't want that.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.250
We know at the anode
it should be oxidized,

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.960
so we can eliminate all
the ones that are reduced.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.300
OK, so we only have really
kind of one good option if you

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.450
say that the platinum is inert.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:11.270
So H2 then gets oxidized in
this case, forming H plus.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:15.920
All right, so let's look
at a cell like this that

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.760
uses the hydrogen electrode.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.620
So here's an example.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.040
Now on this side we have
our regular zinc system

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.420
for our anode.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.200
And so over here we're using,
as the cathode, the hydrogen

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.280
electrode.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.370
And so here in this beautiful
drawing that I made,

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.970
we have a glass tube
here where you're pumping

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.520
H2 gas in at 1 atmosphere.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.030
In the middle of the tube
we have our inert platinum

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.350
electrode.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:51.520
And then these are H2
gas bubbles down here.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:57.520
And we have strong acid HCl,
which is our source of H plus,

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.260
in solution.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.000
So over here again,
this is our cathode.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.690
So we have a reduction
at the cathode.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:11.080
And we have H plus aqueous,
phase transition H2, and gas,

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.550
and then another
phase transition

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:14.890
to our solid platinum electrode.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:18.910
And over here is our standard
anode, our oxidation, that

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.730
involves zinc and zinc plus 2.

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:25.870
So we could also have had the
hydrogen electrode over here as

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:26.639
well.

00:52:26.639 --> 00:52:28.180
All right, so that
gives you a number

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.670
of different examples
of types of electrodes

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:35.230
that you could have and types
of cells that you can have.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:42.170
And that is the end of this,
today's-- or lecture 25 notes.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.240
And as soon as you
finish writing that down,

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.280
we'll go and look at lecture 26.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.480
Again, we're continuing
on the same theme.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.090
And now we're going to
talk about the potential

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:53.050
of these cells.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.000
So we've talked about
the reactions happening

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.400
at anodes and cathodes,
how to write them.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.250
And now we're going to think
about the change in potential

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.990
that occurs when you
run these reactions.

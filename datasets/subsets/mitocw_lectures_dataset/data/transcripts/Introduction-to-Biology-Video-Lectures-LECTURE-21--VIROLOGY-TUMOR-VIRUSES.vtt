WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning class,
nice to see you again.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I trust you had a relaxing
weekend and a Happy Halloween,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whatever a Happy Halloween is.
You recall that last time we were

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
talking about the process
of cell transformation,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and recall, what I said was that
transformation represents the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
conversion of a normal
cell into a cancer cell.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In fact, there are a variety of
traits of a cell which suggest it's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a cancer cell, it
changes its shape,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it can get along with [foralized?
growth factors. Normal cells

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
require tethering to the bottom
of a Petri dish in order to grow.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Cancer cells, you can put
them into a semi-solid medium,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like agar, and cancer cells
will often grow like this,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
as colonies in suspension,
without direct tethering, without

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
direct adhesion to a
solid, underlying substrate.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And that, that's a trait of cancer
cells, the phenotype of cancer cells,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is sometimes called,
anchorage independence.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But ultimately, the best litmus
test, whether a cell is truly

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
transformed, is tumoraganisity,
i.e. the ability of a cell, when

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
plucked out of a Petri-dish like
this, and implanted into a host

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
mouse, to actually
grow into a tumor.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So there are various gradations
of becoming transformed,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but tumoraganisity is the ultimate
arbiter of whether or not a cell is

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
truly transformed. Now,
you'll recall from our

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
conversation last time that
if you put a transformed cell,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a mixed a mono-layer of normal
cells, that the transformed cell will

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
overgrow the mono-layer, it will
have lost contact inhibition,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and that when viewed from above,
such a Petri-dish yields a thick

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
clump of cells, which
is called a focus,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
plural, foci. And I will
tell you that beginning

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in the late 1960's, one
began to use a variety of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
different techniques, with
which to transform cancer cells

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
into normal cells. One of
the techniques one used was

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to apply chemical carcinogens to
cells, and keep in mind that we're

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
reserving the word,
carcinogen, for a chemical or a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
physical agent that causes
cancer. Ultraviolet radiation is a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
carcinogen, as are x-rays,
and there are many chemical

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
carcinogens, such as
those in tobacco smoke.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And certain experiments in the
early 1970's began to reveal that one

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
could get foci of transformed cells,
by applying chemical carcinogen to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the cell in-vitro, and
when I say in-vitro,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I mean growing here, in the
Petri dish. And, in fact,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
one could begin to use a whole
variety of different types of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
carcinogens, chemical carcinogens,
and what seemed to be shared in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
common between all these carcinogens
was that they were all mutagenic.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
By mutagenic, I clearly mean the
ability to inflict damage on the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
genome of the cells that were being
exposed to these various compounds.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
In fact, one could draw an
interesting correlation because many

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of these mutagenic compounds had,
also by chance, been tested in

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
laboratory animals for
their carcinogenicity.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And so plots were derived in the
mid-1970's, between the mutagenic

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
potential of a compound, and
the carcinogenic potential of a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
compound. And when
I say a carcinogen,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
how carcinogenic is a compound, I
mean, how many milligrams of this

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
compound does it take
to make a tumor? And so,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
what one could do, is
plot over a log-log scale,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
how many milligrams of a
given compound was required,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or micrograms, to make a
tumor in a rat or a mouse.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And, at the same time, how
mutagenic were these compounds,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
i.e. how potent were they in
their ability to inflict damage

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
on the genome?
Because it turns out,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that if this log-log scale
is by orders of magnitude,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
powers of ten, compounds range
over at least five or six orders of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
magnitude in their potency
in inflicting mutations,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and similarly, in their potency in
inducing tumors in mice and rats.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And what one found was the
following, that there was a log-log

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
relationship that was roughly linear,
but there was violations to this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Some compounds were extraordinarily
mutagenic, they could create

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
mutations in very low doses,
and at the same time could create

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
tumors, they were
carcinogenic in very low doses.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Other compounds required an enormous
amount of material in order to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
induce mutations on the abscissa,
and an enormous amount of material

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in order to induce tumors on
the ordinate. And this log-log

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
relationship over five orders of
magnitude, suggested the following

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
obvious idea, that carcinogens are
mutagenic, and to the extent that

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
carcinogens are able to induce
cancer, they do so through their

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
ability to inflict mutational
damage on the cells within certain

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
target tissues.
And this, therefore,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
obviously suggested the notion
that within cancer cells,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as we said last time,
there are mutant genes,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and that these mutant genes are
moreover instrumental in conferring

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the transformed phenotype on the
cells that carry these mutant genes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In the, in the late 1960's and
early 1970's, a man named Howard

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Temin, began to use a virus
called Rous sarcoma virus,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
which had first been discovered
in 1909 by a man named Peyton Rous.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Rous was then a professor
at the Rockefeller Institute,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
later the Rockefeller University,
in New York. A Long Island chicken

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
farmer brought in a prized hen
of his who had been growing a big

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
muscle tumor, or sarcoma, in her
breast muscle, and asked Rous,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the famous chicken doctor,
if he could cure this chicken,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and Rous said, thank you,
cut off the hen's head,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
extracted the tumor,
and ground up the tumor,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and after having homogenized
the tumor, passed the homogenate

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
through a filter. And
this filter would trap all

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
cellular material, but it
would allow non-cellular

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
material, or material that was
smaller than the size of a cell,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to pass right through. And so,
therefore, Rous took the material

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that passed through the filter,
which you can call the filtrate,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and he injected the filtrate,
which passed through the filter,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
into a young chick. And what he
observed thereafter was that chick

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
soon came down with sarcoma
after a period of some months,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and when he ground up the tumor in
that chick, and once again injected

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
into another chick, he
once again got a tumor.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The fact that the agent,
which was inducing the cancer,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and could be transmitted
from one animal to another,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from one chicken to the other,
was filterable, suggested it was

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
extremely small, and at
the time one had already

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
begun to appreciate the fact that
there were sub-cellular infectious

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
agents, which we now call viruses.
And Peyton Rous made this very

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
important discovery in 1909,
1910, and in 1965 he was awarded a

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Nobel Prize for this.
It's a rather long wait,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
wouldn't you say? So he
only had to wait 55 years,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
anyhow, he died a happy man,
we can only presume. Now, what's

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
interesting about this is the
life cycle of Rous Sarcoma virus.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
As we will discuss in greater
detail later, viruses are

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
sub-cellular particles, they
don't have their own energy

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
metabolism, and they parasitize on
the macromolecular machinery of the

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
cell that they infect. And
therefore, what we can imagine

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
here is the following scenario,
which actually happens to be true.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
A virus particle, which is
vastly smaller than a cell,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
enters the cell, the virus particle
carries into the cell its own genome,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and this genome, in this
case of Rous Sarcoma virus,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is single-stranded RNA, and this
genome, which is carried into the

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
cell, carries the information
for making more virus particles.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And what happens is, in the
case of Rous Sarcoma virus,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
as Temin later speculated in a
speculation that caused him ridicule

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and ostracism for many years, that
the single-stranded RNA of Rous

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Sarcoma virus, once
it gets into the cell,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
is reverse-transcribe, i.e.
copied into DNA molecules.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So now we have double-stranded DNA,
a double-stranded DNA copy of the

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
viral genome, and this
double-stranded DNA molecule,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
which came to be called a pro-virus,
then became integrated into the host

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
chromosomal DNA. So
here's the host-chromosome.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And now, the pro-virus, which
I'll depict here in the middle,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
in white, became physically inserted
as a double-stranded DNA molecule,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
it was slipped right into the
genome. We now realize that any,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
any of tens, of hundreds, of
millions of different sites in

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the genome of the host cell.
And this pro-virus, once

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
established or integrated into
the genome, could thereafter,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
function essentially like
a cellular gene, i.e. from a

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
molecular-biological perspective,
it was indistinguishable from a

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
cellular gene, it was
double-stranded DNA,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
it had a promoter it carried
in a promoter with it,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and it had a polyadenylation
signal, and therefore, this pro-virus

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
thereafter, could use, or
parasitize, the host-cell RNA

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
polymerase 2, to make
viral messenger RNA,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
on the one hand, and
progeny-genomic RNA.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now when I say genomic, I'm
not talking about the host-cell

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
genome, I'm talking about the
viral genome. How big is the virus?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Well, it's about nine or
ten kilo-bases in length,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
so it's genome, obviously,
is vastly smaller than the 3.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
mega- bases that constitute
the haploid human genome.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
The viral mRNA, once transcribed
in the nucleus, and exported to the

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
cytoplasm, could make viral proteins,
and the viral proteins could then be

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
used to encapsidate, and when
I use the word encapsidate,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
keep in mind, I never use a
simple word when a polysyllabic

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
one is possible. So when
I, when the viral proteins

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
encapsidate the viral-RNA, you
get a virus particle like this,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which has virus proteins on the
outside, almost on the outside,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
viral RNA in the middle,
single-stranded RNA,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and this single-stranded RNA
comes from the transcription of the

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
pro-virus that has now been
integrated into the genome.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Integration is an important
concept here, i.e. it becomes

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
covalently linked. And
this suggests to us that the

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
virus actually encodes
several specialized proteins.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
One set of specialized
proteins is required for the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
reverse-transcription, and
in fact, the virus actually

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
carries with it, into the
cell, not only its RNA,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
but also, reverse transcriptase. So
if you isolate the virus particle,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
it has, in addition to this coat,
it has within it already reversed

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
transcriptase, molecules,
so that the moment that

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
this virion, a virion
is a virus-particle.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The moment that this virion, or
virus-particle, penetrates into

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the cytoplasm of the cell,
there is then, immediately,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
an abundant supply of the
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the process of reverse-transcription
can begin, the double-stranded DNA

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
can be produced,
exported to the cytoplasm,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
where a second viral protein is
responsible for integrating the

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
resulting double-stranded
reverse transcript into the

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
host-cell genome. Again,
that's a highly specialized

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
function. The forward
transcription, we just talked about

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
reverse-transcription, but
the forward-transcription to

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
make progeny RNA, obviously
can rely on the host cell

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
polymerase, the virus doesn't need
to make that. The viral mRNA can be

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
translated by host cell
ribosomes in the cytoplasm,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the virus doesn't need to make that.
Some of the viral aren't, the new

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
viral RNA, is genomic RNA, which
as I say, becomes encapsidated

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to make progeny virus particles.
And a cell, which is infected in

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
this way, can suffer two fates.
It could be, as is in the case with

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
many viruses like this, that
the viruses, that the cell is

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
not actually killed
by this infection, i.e.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that the cell can tolerate an
infectious, an infection like this,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and therefore, if you look at such
a cell, for days and weeks later,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it will be producing virus particles,
which are being released from the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
cell, continuously, continually
released from the cell,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and are able then, to pass
and infect yet other cells.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The alternative to this is what
is called a cytopathic effect,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and the truth of the matter is,
many kinds of viruses, when they go

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and infect a cell, and
they produce their progeny,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
they end up killing the
cell that they've infected.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So, for example, when we
get infected by a cold virus,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
which has a different
metabolism than this one,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
by the way, then the cells that are
infected and produce progeny-virus

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
particles are rather quickly killed,
as a consequence of the infection,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
which is why we have
damage to our nasal mucosa.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But in this case, in the
case of Temin's virus,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
actually RSV, Rous Sarcoma Virus,
that isn't the case. And therefore,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
in fact, one has RSV particles that
are continually being released from

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the cell. If one looks under
the electron microscope,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
at the surface of a virus-infected
cell, one sees structures like this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Where here is in the green
is the lipid by-layer,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the plasma membrane of the
cell. And here, in the middle,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is a viral-protein capsid,
a protein capsid like this,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
encoded by the virus, and
carried in the capsid is actually,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
are actually, the
viral-RNA molecules, and the

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
reverse-transcriptase molecule.
And in saying that, what I mean to

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
suggest to you, is that
actually the viral particle,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the virion, is slightly more
complicated than I represented

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
it to be. As the virus,
as progeny particles

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
are made, they are pushed out
through the plasma membrane of the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
infected cell,
on which occasion,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
they become enveloped with
a layer of plasma membrane.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And this layer of plasma membrane
is actually stolen as a patch from

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the plasma membrane of the
infected cell. So in truth,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
actually, a virus particle like RSV,
has some membrane around it, it has

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
a protein-capsid encoded by the
viral mRNA, and in the middle it has

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
RNA and reverse
transcriptase molecules.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Note, by the way, that
most viruses actually,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
everything that the virus carries,
the virus has encoded in it's own

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
genome, in this case, the
virus has stolen, has absconded,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
with a patch of plasma
membrane from the infected cell.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Now what Temin observered,
several other people before him had

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
done so, was that when he infected
a mono-layer of chicken cells with

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Rous Sarcoma virus,
he was able to in fact,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
observe the appearance of
foci of transformed cells.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And he observed that these foci of
transformed cells actually released

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Rous Sarcoma Virus. So, the
infection by Rous Sarcoma

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Virus, had led to the production
of progeny virus particles,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
which we kind of expect of a virus.
Keep in mind that if a virus can't

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
produce progeny,
it's out of business.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Or, to put it another way, the
only thing a virus is really

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
interested in, is making
more copies of itself.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So, the cells in these foci of
transformants were transformed,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but they were also releasing
progeny virus particles.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And if you took these virus
particles, and he could isolate them

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
away from any contaminating cell,
the way Peyton Rous did, just by

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
filtering them, or the
filter will trap all of the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cells, and allow the much tinier
virus particles to pass through,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
then he could take these virus
particles and infect another plate

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
of cells, and once again, he
would get foci of transformants.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And therefore, this virus
was actually bipotential, it

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
could do two things.
It could replicate,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
here I've been talking about the
life cycle or the replication-cycle

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
of the virus, on the one hand,
and on the other hand, it could

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
transform cells. And
subsequent work demonstrated

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that actually, the
replicated functions of Rous

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Sarcoma Virus,
on the one hand,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and the transforming functions
of Rous Sarcoma Virus,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
on the other hand, were
encoded in separable genes.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
For example, Howard Temin
was able to demonstrate,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and others later, that one
could get mutants of RSV

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that had lost the ability
to transform cells,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
but could still
replicate perfectly well.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And there were yet other mutants
that had lost the ability to

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
replicate, but could
transform perfectly well.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And so there were two
classes of specialized genes,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
one involved in replication,
the other in transformation. In

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
1975 and 1976, the
laboratories of Harold Varmus

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and Mike Bishop, at
University of California,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
San Francisco, or UCSF, as
it's called in the trade,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
began to exam the origin of
the viral transforming gene.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Now the viral transforming gene,
because it was assumed there was

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
only one of them, the
genome is so small,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
it only has about ten kilo-basis,
and only enough room for three, or

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
four, or five, genes in
it, not a hundred or a

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
thousand, the viral transforming
gene came to be called SRC,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
S-R-C. And what they
observed was the following,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
they made a radio-labeled probe,
which was specific for the SRC gene.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And they could use
the radio-labeled

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
probe to anneal to two kinds of
viruses, wild-type Rous Sarcoma

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Virus, and a deletion mutant, I'll
use the Greek -delta, a version

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
of Rous Sarcoma Virus, which
was lacking, which apparently

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
through process of genetic deletion,
was lacking the ability to transform

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
cells. And that loss of ability to
transform cells was ostensibly due

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
to the lesion of it's
genome of the SRC gene.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And what they observed is that the
SRC, the radio-labeled SRC probe,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
as one would've hoped, was able
to anneal to this wild-type genome,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
but it couldn't anneal to
the deletion mutant of RSV,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
which had lost the SRC gene through
a process of genetic deletion.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So, so far, so good. By the way,
the fact that the SRC gene could

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
transform cells, led
to it's being called,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
an oncogene. The term "oncos" in
Greek means, a tumor or a lump,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
an oncogene therefore,
was a cancer-causing gene.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And therefore, Rous
Sarcoma Virus possessed at

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
least one cancer-causing gene,
or oncogene. Now the mind-blowing

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
result that happened shortly
thereafter, was the following.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
People in the Varmus-Bishop lab
began to look for the origins of the

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
SRC oncogene of Rous Sarcoma Virus.
It turns out that the vast majority

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
of genes that have been in virus,
that are present in viral genomes,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
have been in viral genomes,
as far as we know, for the last

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
billion years. i.e. we
have every reason to think

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
that the evolutionary origins
of viruses can be traced into the

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
distant past. It could even
be the case, some people think,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
some perfectly sane people think,
that this whole retro-virus life

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
cycle that I just told you about,
recapitulates one of the earliest

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
stages of cellular evolution on
the planet. People believe now,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
with ever-increasing conviction,
and keep in mind, class, people who

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
are convinced of something are
usually wrong, in a loud voice.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
But people believe with
ever-increasing conviction,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
that the first cells on earth
actually had RNA genomes,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
rather than DNA genomes, and that
the invention of double-stranded DNA

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
genomes in cellular life forms,
came later. And if it did, then the

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
conversion from an RNA to a DNA
state is reflected in the modern

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
life cycle of Rous Sarcoma Virus,
and similar viruses, which as you

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
may know, have come to be called
retroviruses, simply because they

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
transcribe their
nucleic acid backwards.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So, Varmus and Bishop were
interested in the origins of the SRC

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
oncogene that was carried
by Rous Sarcoma Virus.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I say, well it probably,
the Rous Sarcoma Virus, had

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
antecedents, which existed
thousands and millions of years ago,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and carried the SRC oncogene.
But the fact of the matter is,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
the SRC, the Rous Sarcoma Virus,
had only been isolated once in the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
20th century, when this
very trusting, and caring,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Long Island chicken farmer
came in to Peyton Rous,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
hoping that Rous would cure his
chicken, rather than cutting the

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
chicken's head off.
So what happened,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
then, was the following. They
used this radiolabeled probe

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
to look at the DNA of infected,
RSV-infected chicken cells, and

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
uninfected chicken cells.
So they probed the DNA of the

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
infected chicken cells,
with this radiolabeled probe,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and they probed the DNA
with uninfected chicken cell,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
of uninfected chicken cells,
once again with this radiolabeled

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
probe. And
what they,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
what they expected to find was
the following, it's obvious,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
in uninfected chicken cells
you don't find any SRC,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
and in infected chicken cells,
you do find SRC, because the SRC

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
gene has been brought into the
infected cells by the infecting

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
viral genome. Stands to reason,
right? Shouldn't be any in the

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
uninfected cells, after
the cell's infected,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
now they have a SRC, at least one
copy, they may have multiple copies

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
of the SRC oncogene, because
I haven't really dictated

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
how many pro-viruses should
be integrated into the genome

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
of an infected cell. And
what they found was puzzling,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
and eventually mind-blowing.
Because they found that in the DNA

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
of uninfected chicken cells,
they could find a SRC gene, and

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
these uninfected chicken cells had
never experienced Rous Sarcoma Virus

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
in any form, whatsoever. And
as a consequence, they began to

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
develop a theory, a
model, which turned out,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
actually, to be right on,
and the model was as follows,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
that there was a retrovirus,
like Rous Sarcoma Virus, that was

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
the precursor of RSV, and
this retrovirus had replication

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
genes, but it lacked a
transforming oncogene.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
This retrovirus went into a chicken
cell, and when it emerged from the

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
chicken cell, it carried not
only the replication genes,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
but now the SRC oncogene.
It had acquired a new gene,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
which it could then use to
subsequently transform other cells

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
that it had infected. And
this, itself, turned out to be

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
absolutely right. This
SRC gene was of cellular

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
origin, and in fact,
homologs of the SRC gene,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
were present in all vertebrates,
in all chordates, in all metazoan,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
there's even a distant homolog
of the SRC gene that's present in

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
sponge cells, which are
obviously rather primitive.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
So this SRC gene is not a recent
invention, it's been sitting around

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
in the eukaryotic genome, at
least in the genome of metazoan

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
and its precursors,
for a very long time.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It was kidnapped, picked up
by the Rous Sarcoma Virus,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
and subsequently exploited by the
virus to transform cells that it

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
happened to infect. And this
acquisition and activation

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
of a gene was obviously a rare event,
because RSV, as I've just told you,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
was only picked up once,
was only generated once.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It didn't exist in nature, and
Rous Sarcoma Virus was never

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
seen to, go from one chicken flock
to the other, like most infectious

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
agents. The ecology of Rous Sarcoma
Virus is not so much of interest to

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
us, what is of greatest interest
to us in our discussion today,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
is the following notion that,
within the normal genome of a

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
chicken cell, there exists a normal
gene which came to be called a

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
proto-oncogene, a
precursor of the,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
A proto-oncogene which
resides in normal chicken DNA,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
and the fact that the
proto-oncogene is highly conserved,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
evolutionary, dictates to
us that this proto-oncogene,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
this SRC proto-oncogene, must
mediate essential functions,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
otherwise it wouldn't long
ago been lost. In fact,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
just to repeat myself,
virtually identical copies of the

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
SRC oncogene, proto-oncogene,
excuse me, lie, can be found in the

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
genomes of all vertebrates.
So, a proto-oncogene is a normal

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
cellular, growth-regulating gene,
which, on this occasion, became

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
activated, and subverted,
and converted into an active

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
transforming gene, i.e.
an oncogene. So the term

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
-proto in this case,
implies a normal gene,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
which has the potential,
under certain circumstances,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
to become an active oncogene.
In the years that followed,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it's been almost 30 years now,
more than 30 proto-oncogenes have

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
been discovered, by looking
at retroviruses like RSV.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
SRC is not the only proto-oncogene
that lies in our genome,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
and therefore, we begin to
appreciate on the basis of this,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
that our genome carries a
whole repertoire of these

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
growth-regulating genes that,
when a retrovirus happens to swoop

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
in, can be activated into active
oncogenes, they can be converted

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
into active oncogenes, and
thereafter, they can induce

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
cancer. And this
obviously leads to the

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
suggestion that the seeds
of human cancer don't lie,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
necessarily, on the outside of cells
because most kinds of human cancers

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
are not caused by infecting viruses.
That was a puzzle that was already

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
apparent in the late-1970's. If
Rous Sarcoma Virus, or similar

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
viruses, could not be invoked
to explain many kinds of viruses,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
how could one get cancer? And this
work suggested an obvious solution.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Let's imagine that there
are a repertoire of a dozen,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
or two-dozen, or three-dozen,
proto-oncogenes that reside in our

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
normal genome, their purpose
there is not to create

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
cancer, their purpose is to
regulate normal cell proliferation.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
These genes, being genes,
are subject to damage,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
to mutation, and therefore we
can imagine that in cases of human

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
cancer, where there are no viruses
involved, there can be genetic

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
alteration of the DNA sequences
of a proto-oncogene that converted

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
into an oncogene. i.e
chemical changes to the DNA,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
mutagenic changes to the DNA,
can mimic the conversion of a

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
proto-oncogene to an oncogene,
without any virus. There are other

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
ways by which you can skin this cat.
And one experiment to demonstrate

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
that is the following. Did we
talk at the end of last time

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
about the guy who got a bladder
carcinoma after 40 years of smoking?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I'm glad we did. Good. So,
let's say this person gets a,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
has a bladder carcinoma, and
he got the bladder carcinoma,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
and it was called an EG bladder
carcinoma, and he got it for reasons

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
we described last time, and
I can't imagine you have any

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
illusions about whether
smoking is good or bad for you,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
after last time. But anyhow,
so, EG bladder carcinoma, pig DNA

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
from the tumor, so
we make tumor DNA.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And now, and by the way, we
presume correctly that viruses

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
have nothing to do with
this particular cancer,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
with the development of this cancer,
and by the way, the development of a

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
disease is another wonderful
polysyllabic Greek word,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
pathogenesis. Pathogenesis
means the study of how

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
a disease is caused, what
generates the disease.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
So the pathogenesis of bladder
carcinoma has nothing whatsoever to

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
do with any viruses. Maybe
it had to do with the fact

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
that cigarette smoke mutated genes,
mutated, proto-oncogenes in the DNA

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
of Mr. Jones, that happens
to have been his name,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
or his pseudonym, who knows,
Mr. Jones' bladder cells.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
So one takes
tumor DNA here,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
and one uses the procedure of
transfection, where you take the DNA,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
make a DNA, and you put it into
normal cells, by a gene transfer,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
or a transfection procedure.
So, this is transfection,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
or gene transfer, these are
equally applicable names,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
and what was found on this
occasion was, that one got foci of

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
transformed cells. And
these foci, for all practical

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
purposes, looked just like the foci
that Howard Temin had gotten years

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
earlier, by infecting monolayers
of chicken cells, with Rous

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Sarcoma Virus.
And therefore,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
that suggested very strongly,
that the DNA of the bladder

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
carcinoma, carried within it,
an oncogene that was capable of

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
transforming these recipient
cells, into which the DNA had been

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
introduced by the transfection
procedure. It remained,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
of course, to actually find that.
I'll mention to you in passing,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
that one does a
control experiment here.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
If you take normal DNA, you do
the exact same experiment you

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
never get foci. So that
means, it's not as if all

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
human DNA carries oncogenes in
it. The normal DNA doesn't give you

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
foci, the DNA from the bladder
carcinoma does give you foci.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And so, about 20 years ago, one
actually looked at the normal DNA

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
and the tumor DNA, and one
came up with the following,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
that the bladder carcinoma oncogene,
was about, let's say, 6KB long,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
there was a corresponding,
normal proto-oncogene.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
It was also 6 kilobasis long.
This was a normal DNA, this was

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
extracted by cloning, gene
cloning, from the genome of the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
bladder carcinoma. And
having extracted it,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
one then began to look at how
different these two genes were from

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
one another. This transformed
cells, this did not transform cells.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
If one did restriction enzyme
mapping, one found the identical

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
array of restriction enzyme sites.
So it was clear that even though

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
these two genes, we can
call the normal one a

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
proto-oncogene, these two
genes were structurally

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
identical, they couldn't
be absolutely identical,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
because biologically, they
were behaving very differently.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And so, when the sequence analyses
were done, it was discovered that

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
the difference between the normal
proto-oncogene and the oncogene,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
was a single point mutation,
a single-base pair change.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
And that single-base pair
change created a potent oncogene.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And that single-based pair change,
one could show in comparable tumors,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
was a somatic mutation. Remember,
we said somatic mutations are

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
mutations that strike the
genomes of cells in our soma,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
rather than the germ line.
That somatic mutation had almost

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
surely had struck one of the
epithelial cells lining the bladder

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
of Mr. Jones' urinary
bladder. How did this work?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Well, let's go back to our
discussion of growth factor

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
receptors, you recall we
talked about them last time.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Let's say, here's a growth factor
receptor at the cell surface,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
the growth factor receptor
sends signals into the cell,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
and such a sequence of signals,
where you go from a to b, to c to d,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
is sometimes called a signaling
pathway, sometimes it's called a

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
signaling cascade, It's
a molecular bucket brigade

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
where a passes signals to b,
passes signals to c, to do, and so

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
fourth, and they cross-communicate
with one another to process this

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
incoming signal from the growth
factor activated receptor.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Now it turned out that the
protein product of this,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
of a normal proto-oncogene, and
the bladder carcinoma oncogene,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
sat right down here, in
the signaling cascade,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
downstream in the signaling cascade
of the growth factor receptor.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And the protein product was
a very interesting protein,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
it was a protein, which came
to be called RAS, in fact,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
the original proto-oncogene had
previously been associated with a

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
retrovirus. But in this case, it
was clear that the activation of

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
the proto-oncogene to the oncogene
had nothing to do whatever,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
with the intervention, by a
retrovirus, or by the acquisition of

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
a retrovirus, by a
normal proto-oncogene.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
So RAS has the normal, the
following normal lifestyle.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
RAS normally exists in a
quiet state, an inactive state,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
so here's RAS, and while it's
in the quiet state it binds GDP,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
guanosine diphosphate, GDP. What
happens, then, is that RAS on

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
occasion, gets an incoming signal
from some upstream activator,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
and you can imagine what the
upstream activator is from here.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Keep in mind, I'm only
focusing now on, let's say,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
component c of this signaling
cascade, so an upstream activator

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
comes in, and impinges on RAS.
And in so doing, it wants to switch

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
RAS from a quiet to an
activated state. So what happens,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
when RAS gets a signal from,
an upstream signal from here,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
RAS will shed its GDP, and
will instead, allow a GTP

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
to jump aboard. So now
a GTP can jump aboard,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
and now RAS is in its active state
up here. And while it's in its

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
active state, it can emit growth
stimulatory signals into the cell,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
like that. I'm not showing
you exactly what it looks like,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
but it can emit signals.
And this is, by the way,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
called a signal transducing protein,
a protein that tranduces signals

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
receives signals from higher up
in the cascade, and passes them on

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
lower into the cascade. So
it's transducing these signals,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
and so RAS is put, here I
should've capitalized RAS here,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
so RAS is now in
its active state.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It's received upstream signals,
it's shed its GDP, its bound GDP,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
and while it's there, RAS passes
signals on further downstream in the

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
pathway. So, if want to relate
it to the signaling cascade,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
and we imagine that RAS is
component c of this cascade,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
it receives signals from b, and
then RAS passes signals onto d,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
it's sitting in-between
them, it's an intermediary,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
it's a member of this
molecular bucket-brigade.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Now what happens is that RAS is in
this active state for only a period

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
of usually milliseconds, and
after it's in a period of this

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
active stage, and it's emitting
growth stimulatory signals,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
downstream, for a period of
milliseconds, RAS does something

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
very interesting. It
hydrolyzes the GTP,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
and when it hydrolyzes the GTP
into GDP, obviously an inorganic

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
phosphate comes out,
RAS switches itself off,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
i.e. RAS has an intrinsic
GTPase activity, GTPase means

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
it can cleave GTP. So it's
as if there was a switch

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
here, and I could turn it on,
well I'm not going to mess with it

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
since I still haven't figured
out how the switches work,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
but it's as if there was a light
switch here that I could switch on,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
and the lights would be on
for a short period of time,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
and then the switch would
automatically shut itself off.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
A negative-feedback control to
ensure that the period of activation

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
of the RAS protein is only
a period of milliseconds,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
and that the pulse of downstream
signals that are released is finite,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
circumscribed, limited, it's
only a quantum of signals that

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
are released. After
which occasion,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
RAS hydrolyzes it's GTP and shuts
itself off. It's a nice system,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
and it actually works because,
as I've told you before,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
we go through ten of the
sixteenth cell divisions,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
with RAS proteins in our cells,
and rarely, if we lead virtuous

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
lives and listen to everything
I've said in the last lecture,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
do we ever get cancer. So, what
happens when the RAS encoding

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
gene becomes mutated in cancer?
That's another one of those

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
questions that I'm really glad I
asked, because what happens is that

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
the ability of the GTPase activity
to function, is knocked out.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
The GTPase can no longer operate,
and therefore, the ability of RAS to

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
shut itself off, by
cleaving GTP down to GDP,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
is now compromised, and as a
consequence, RAS is trapped for

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
extended periods of time, for
minutes and hours, and maybe

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
even days, in this excited
signal-emitting configuration,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
on which occasion, it sends out
a continuous flood of signals.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
In fact, we now know
that the point-mutation,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
which happens in the gene here,
and is seen, by the way, in about

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
20% of human cancers that have
virtually identical point-mutations,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
those, that point mutation is in
the GTPase domain of the RAS protein,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
that is normally responsible
for cleaving GTP into GDP.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
So now we can begin to get a very
concrete and specific understanding,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
an insight, into the mechanism
by which a point mutation,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
a somatic mutation, can have a
dramatic effect on the ability of a

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
cell to grow.
Note, by the way,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
that if RAS is sending signals
constitutively down here,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
and you may recall that
the word constitutive means,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
at a constant and unrelenting
fashion. So the ability of RAS,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
which I depicted as residing right
in here in the signaling cascade,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
to send out signals
unrelentingly down like this,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
means that the signals up here
are no longer so important.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
RAS might require a brief stimulus
to get into this activated state,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
but then it can sit around for
hours and days, pushing the cell to

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
proliferate. And the subsequent
exposure of a cell carrying a RAS

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
oncogene is now gratuitous,
it's unnecessary, because this

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
downstream signal emitter has gone
wild, and is firing and pushing the

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
cell to grow unrelentingly.
Interestingly, that signal is very

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
critically important in pushing
cells to move through the G1 phase

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
of their growth
and division cycle.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
In other words, it's
during that phase of the

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
division cycle, that RAS
is actually able to send

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
it's signals that perturb cell
cycling, and push the cell to move

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
from G1 up to the restriction point,
and then into the remaining part of

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
the cell cycle. So now we
see how somatic mutations,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and we now know about dozens of such
genes, can convert proto-oncogenes

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
to oncogenes, without the
intervention of any retrovirus.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
There are yet another class
of genes, which are called,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
tumor suppressor genes, and
these tumor suppressor genes

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
operate in exactly the opposite way
as proto-oncogenes and oncogenes.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
The proto-oncogenes and oncogenes,
from what I've told you, you can

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
imagine are functioning analogously
to accelerator pedals on a car,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they push the cell to proliferate
and, when you have a cancer,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
the accelerator pedal gets stuck
to the floor. In other words,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
it's no longer well regulated.
The tumor suppressor genes work in

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
an opposite fashion, as a
breaking system to slow down

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
cell proliferation. And,
as such, tumor suppressor

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
genes operate to counteract,
and counterbalance, and limit,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
the growth stimulatory signals
that are coming from the RAS gene,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
and other growth promoting genes.
So there's two sides to the coin,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
indeed as you can imagine
from circuit theory,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
any positive signal must be counter
balanced by a negative signal,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
so that you end up having some
kind of physical balance that is

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
compatible with normal,
biological function.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
So these tumor suppressor genes
are normally functioning as break,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
break linings of a cell, if you
will, and that also describes how they

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
become involved in cancer. The
mutation that struck the RAS

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
gene caused a hyper-activation
of the proto-oncogene.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
The proto-oncogene
was hyper-activated,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
and now it began sending out an
unrelenting stream of growth-stimulatory

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
signals. As
you can imagine,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
as it is intuitively obvious,
in the case of tumor suppressor

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
genes, when they became involved
in cancer, what kind of mutations

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
affect them? Inactivating mutations.
So there's a very interesting gene,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
it's called the retinoblastoma
gene, and the retinoblastoma gene,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
the retinoblastoma is a
rare eye-tumor of children,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
it happens about 1/20,000 kids,
and the retinoblastoma gene, if you

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
look at the retinoblastoma gene
in the genomes of tumor cells,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
these are the eye cells
that form the precursors,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
the rods and the cones, and
other neuronal cells lining the

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
retina. Here's the
normal retinoblastoma

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
gene, and it's 190 kilo basis long.
So it's a pretty nice size gene,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
it's not the biggest,
it's not the smallest.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
If you look at many retinoblastoma
tumors, what you find is that there

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
are major portions of the gene
that have been just deleted.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Here I'll show you one deletion,
here's another deletion, here's a

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
third deletion, sometimes
the whole gene is deleted,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
and cut out. Obviously
such deletions are not

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
enhancing the function of
the retinoblastoma gene,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
obviously they're wiping it out.
And therefore, we can begin to

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
imagine that the way that the tumor
suppressor genes are recruited into

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
the process of forming cancer
is through their elimination,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
rather than through their
hyper activation. In fact,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
as you might also imagine, a
cell, which has the following

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
genotype, RB+, RB-,
actually grows normally.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Why? Because one of the two
alleles has been inactivated,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
the minus, but the other allele
is still, is still active,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
and still functional, and still able
to create an adequately functional

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
break lining. Only when
a cell becomes RB- like

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
this, homozygous minus, does
it begin to grow uncontrollably,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
because now it lacks all ability
to manufacture the normally required

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
break lining. And this begins, as
well, to explain certain kinds of

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000
hereditary cancers, because
in certain individuals,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
they inherit a defective allele
of the RGB, and therefore,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
at the moment of conception,
they have the following genotype.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Well, you'll say that's all,
that's fine, because each of their

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
cells has a wild-type copy of
their RB gene, and a mutant,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
defective copy. And the wild-type
copy, as you will correctly say,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
suffices to template, to orchestrate,
to program, normal cell behavior.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Why do they then
get retinoblastomas?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Because the surviving wild-type
gene, or the gene copy,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
the wild-type allele, can
be lost with a certain,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
finite probability per cell
generation, through chromosomal

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
mistakes, accidents, or
through crossing-over.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And so roughly, one in
ten to the sixth cells,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
one has an event, a genetic accident,
which causes the accidental loss of

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
the surviving RB allele,
leaving, RB wild-type allele,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
leading now to a genotype that
looks like this, homozygous mutant,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
or homozygous inactive, and now a
rare cell in which that has happened,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
now begins to proliferate
uncontrollably because of the

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
absence of the RB break lining,
which is normally required to

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
control cell proliferation. By
the way, I'll tell you in passing,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
without describing the gory details,
that the RB protein works at the end,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
at the restriction point. We
talked about the restriction

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
point last time, you
remember? The RB protein

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
actually prevents the cell from
advancing through the restriction

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
point gate, unless it becomes
inactivated, and then the cell can

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
sail through into the
rest of the cell cycle.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
In cells that lack the RB protein,
the guardian of the restriction

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
point gate is no longer there, and
therefore the gate is held open,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.000
and cells can sail all the way
through G1, in an unimpeded fashion,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
without the RB protein standing
at the restriction point gate and

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
saying, advance no further, unless
and until, certain conditions

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
have been satisfied. And so
we can begin to understand

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
that the tumor suppressor gene,
the RB gene, is able to act as a

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
quality control, to
ensure that cells don't

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
inadvertently, inappropriately,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
pass through the restriction point
gate into the rest of the cell cycle.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And by now, there are 40 or 50
different kinds of tumor suppressor

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
genes that are found to be
inactivated through various

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
mechanisms, in human cancers.
This was only the progenitor,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the harbinger, of those. How many
tumors does a child who's born like,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
this get in his
eyes, or her eyes?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Well, it might get two or
three or four, in both eyes,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
but that reflects the fact that
there maybe a million or two million

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
cells in each of the retina,
which are susceptible to this loss

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
of the surviving wild-type gene
copy. Having heard all that,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
you will ask me, well why don't
they get tumors all over the body,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
since it is the fact that the RB
protein regulates the restriction

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
point gate in all cells
throughout the body?

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
So therefore, why isn't the
child who's born constitutionally,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
whose genetic makeup is this,
why isn't a child like this

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
sensitive to developing tumors
all over his or her body?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
In fact, children who are born
genetically with this genotype,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
get retinoblastoma's with
high probability early in life,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
and as teenagers, they often
come down with osteosarcomas,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
which are tumors of the bones.
But otherwise, they don't get many

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
kinds of cancer, and the
answer to your question is,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
I haven't the vaguest idea.
No one knows why loss of this

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
critical gene that plays
a key role in the biology,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
in the metabolism, of all
cells throughout the body,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
can be lost to yield cancer
in the eye and in the bone,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
whereas when the same gene,
which must be lost elsewhere in

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
other tissues in the body are lost,
tumors do not arise. And on that

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
puzzling note, I wish
you a pleasant day,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
another happy Halloween, and see you
on, oh yes, tomorrow is election day.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Don't forget to vote. And
remember what the mayor of

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Boston once said,
vote early and often.

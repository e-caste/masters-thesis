00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.497
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.520
Last week we talked
about random variables.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.540
And this week
we're going to talk

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.550
about their expected value.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
The expected value
of a random variable

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.637
comes up in all sorts
of applications.

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:44.720
We're going to spend a
whole week talking about it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.980
and some of next week
talking about variations

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.496
from the expected value.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:49.870
And it's probably
one of the best

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.190
tools you have for
working with probability

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.289
problems in practice.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.747
So let's write down
the definition.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.320
The expected value
also has other names.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:23.570
It's also known as the
average or the mean

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.683
of a random variable.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:41.950
Random variable R over
a probability space S

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.520
is denoted by a lot of ways.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.760
We're going to use Ex
to denote it, Ex of R.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.070
And it's the sum over all
possible outcomes in the sample

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.670
space of the value of
the random variable

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.190
on that outcome times the
probability of that outcome.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.310
In other words, the expected
value of a random variable

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.080
is just a weighted average
of all possible values

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.380
of the random variable where
the weight is the probability

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.910
of that happening.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:27.438
For example, suppose we
roll a fair six sided die.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.810
So the numbers that
come up are 1 to 6.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
And we let R be the
random variable denoting

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.135
the outcome, 1 through 6.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.990
So the expected
value of the role,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.160
we can easily compute
from the definition.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.890
Well, there's a 1/6 chance
that it comes out a 1.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.200
The next outcome would be a 2.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.600
That happens with 1/6 chance.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.025
3, 4, 5, and six all
happen with a 1/6 chance.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.000
If I sum up 1, 2, 3, 4 up to
6, I get 6 times 7 over 2 times

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.910
the 1/6 is just 7
over 2 or 3 and 1/2.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.320
So expected value when I roll
a die, a fair six sided die,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320
is just 3 and 1/2.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.880
And as you can see
from this example,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.210
the expected value doesn't
have to be attainable by one

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.030
of the outcomes.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.730
You don't get a 3 and
1/2 when you roll a die.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.840
But that's the average value.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.080
Now the expected value, the
expectation, the average,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.812
the mean, they're
all the same thing.

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:48.770
They're all defined based
on a random variable.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.890
They all mean the same thing.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.384
They are all different
than the median.

00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:55.800
That's something
that's different.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.400
So let me define the median.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.090
Basically it is the
outcome which splits

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.390
the probabilities in half.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.030
In other words, you've
got a 50% chance

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.260
of being bigger than the median
and a 50% chance of being

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.760
smaller.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.209
Now precisely you can
define it this way.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.950
The median of a
random variable R

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:35.300
is the value in the range of
R such that the probability

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.700
that the random variable is
less than this median point is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.020
at most 1/2.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.330
And the probability
that random variable

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.086
is bigger than the median
is strictly less than 1/2.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.950
Now, some texts
do it differently.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.944
They swap this less than
or equal to with this one.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:58.610
And it could give you
a different answer

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.170
if you do that.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.506
And I think in the text,
actually, we screwed it up.

00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:05.880
So we have to get
that corrected.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.796
I think we might have
put a less than or equal

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.990
here, which is not
the right definition.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.160
So this is the right
definition that we'll use.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.730
So using this definition,
what is the median

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.950
of the random variable that
corresponds to rolling a die?

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.551
What's the median when I
roll a six sided fair die?

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.820
Not 3 and 1/2, because it's
got to be one of the values.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.652
The median does have
to be in the realm

00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:36.610
of the random variable.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.340
It has to one of the
attainable values.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.900
What's the median value
when I roll a die?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.280
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.980
PROFESSOR: Four.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.580
Let's try that out.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.620
If I plug in 4 here, the
probability I'm less than 4

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.790
is 1/2.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.540
Could be 1, 2, or 3.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.330
The probability of greater
than 4 is 5 or six is 1/3.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.470
That's less than 1/2.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.280
So 4 works.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.290
3 doesn't work, because the
probability I'm bigger than 3

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.710
is 1/2.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.296
So it doesn't work.

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:10.170
And the other definition
sometimes people use

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.960
would turn out that
three is the median.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160
Now, we're not going
to spend any more

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.330
time talking about the median.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.430
What's really important in
probability is the mean.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.170
And that's because
you can do a whole lot

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.970
more with it in applications.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.770
Any question about the
definitions so far?

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.890
All right, so now we're going to
do a more interesting example.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.780
We're going to play
a gambling game

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.110
and we're going to analyze the
expected winnings, the expected

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.810
return.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.090
And this is a simple
three person game

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.480
that you can see played
in bars and informally.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.590
But to play it I
need a volunteer

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.625
from the class, somebody
who wants to play.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.250
You've done it.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.041
Who hasn't done it?

00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:00.359
Have you done it?

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:01.150
You haven't played.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.012
Do you have money
in your pocket?

00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:04.220
You got to borrow some money.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.048
If you don't have any money,
you got to borrow some.

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:08.770
AUDIENCE: How much money?

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.560
PROFESSOR: Oh, I
don't know, $5 or $10.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.120
Got it?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.507
All right, come on down.

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:17.620
you're going to play
against a couple of TAs.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.910
Maybe a couple of you
will want to play.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.630
I'll get Nick and
Martyna to play here.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.960
Now, this is a very simple game.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.060
In each round, each of the
players is going to wager $2.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.950
So I can loan you guys
some money here, I guess.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.741
So you have $2?

00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:41.240
All right, I have
to loan you money.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.646
I better count this out.

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:44.354
AUDIENCE: I think I
can find the Zimbabwe

00:07:44.354 --> 00:07:45.900
dollars I had here somewhere.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.260
PROFESSOR: I don't know
if I'm taking those.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.426
Here, you can split that up.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.850
I loaned you guys $10 there.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.880
You got $2.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.780
Put it on the table.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.760
Wager your $2.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.160
Now what we're going
to do is they're each

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.230
going to guess the
results of a coin toss.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.371
We'll put the pot
together here, mix it up.

00:08:05.371 --> 00:08:06.370
You only have to do two.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.250
You can save those for now.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.420
Oh, that's your two.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.220
All right, so we
have $6 in the pot.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.670
Now, each of you is going to
guess the outcome of a coin.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.330
So here's the guesses.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.930
Heads or tails, that's for you.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.399
Heads or tails,
the guess for you.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.690
And you get a heads or a tails.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.270
So instead of writing
it down, you're

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.070
going to sort of
hide those, maybe

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.820
get some advice from
the class, and you're

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.409
going to pick one and put it on
the table here as your guess.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.650
And then one of you out
there is going to flip a coin

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.909
and announce the
result. And then we're

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.480
going to reveal their
guesses and the winners

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.670
split the money.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.940
And if there's no winners,
well, they take their $2 back

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.570
and they split the pot.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.520
So this is a very fair game.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.810
They make their
choices, you guys

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.350
toss the coin, and the
winners share of the pot.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.650
If there's one, winner they get
$6, which is a profit of $4.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.480
Two winners, they each
get three, profit of one,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.790
the other one's out two bucks.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.940
Nobody wins, they get
their money back, profit 0.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.300
They all win, they get
their money back, profit 0.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.520
Is the game clear?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.810
Who's got a coin out there?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.030
You've got a coin?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.870
Very good.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.510
Now you've got to
guess the coin.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.520
Don't show each
other your guesses.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.459
And put your guesses
on the table here.

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:27.750
You get to pick heads or tails.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.583
Put it on the table.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.620
[LAUGHS]

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.950
This is not a hard game.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.710
You got a heads
and a tails, right?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.198
Well, yeah, did you put a
heads or a tails in there?

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:51.650
Yeah, there's one
heads, one tails.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.420
No, that's blank.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.909
You don't win that way.

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:54.450
There you go.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.158
That's the tails.

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:56.940
AUDIENCE: I thought you meant--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.690
PROFESSOR: Heads.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.418
So if you want heads,
you go like that.

00:09:59.418 --> 00:09:59.846
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:01.560
I thought you meant
do it the other way.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.345
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:04.205
AUDIENCE: All right, I'll have
to make these indistinguishable

00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:05.140
now.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.140
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.030
One of them is
all ripped up now.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.490
They already guessed, so they've
already done their guess.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.800
So you pick one
and put it there.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.425
AUDIENCE: This is
what I was originally

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:15.997
going to guess anyway.

00:10:15.997 --> 00:10:17.080
PROFESSOR: So that's good.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:24.690
And you now flip the coin
and tell us what it came out.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.562
AUDIENCE: Heads.

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:26.270
PROFESSOR: Heads.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.811
All right, let's
reveal your choices.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.930
All right, so there's one heads.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.780
Martyna takes all the money.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.377
Just bad luck there, right?

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:38.460
We're going to play again.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.793
We're going to play a few times.

00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:43.490
But let's start recording
what happened here.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.850
So the coin came out heads.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.005
OK, remind me your name?

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:48.630
AUDIENCE: Adam.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.950
PROFESSOR: Adam gassed tails.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.061
And Martyna.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.290
Is it Y?

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:07.680
Martyna guessed heads and
Nick, he also loses at tails.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.780
So in this case Adam is out $2.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.800
Martyna got a profit of $4.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.230
And Nick is also down $2.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.800
All right, let's try it again.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.500
So again, pick another
heads or tails.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.802
Adam's busily working
out probabilities here.

00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:33.010
Well you got to put your
money on the table here now.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.700
You got $2.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.480
That's three.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.517
Here you go.

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:39.990
[LAUGHS]

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.490
There we go.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.330
Two more dollars.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.390
You can make change if you want.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.650
There we go.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.990
All right, make your choices.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.800
You got one?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.050
As long as you guys don't
show him your choices,

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.340
we should be good here, I think.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.790
And you got to pick one here.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.640
Very good.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.370
Can we have a coin toss please?

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.300
AUDIENCE: Heads.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.460
PROFESSOR: Heads again.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.560
What do we got?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.480
All right, good job.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.506
OK, Adam got heads and
Martyna's on a roll here.

00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:12.630
So we got to split this up.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.360
Can you make change
for him here?

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.080
He gets $3.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.750
So it was heads.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.870
Adam had heads, Martyna has
heads, and Nick's in trouble.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.180
Nick's off another
$2 of my money.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.690
Martyna is up $1 because she
wagered two and got three

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.570
and Adam is up $1
here for that one.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.420
All right, let's make
another selection.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.700
Heads or tails?

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.860
Put the money up here, $2.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.786
Going to need another
loan here, Nick?

00:12:47.786 --> 00:12:49.410
AUDIENCE: I can
throw in my keys.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.910
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.889
AUDIENCE: The keys to
my non-existent car.

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:53.930
PROFESSOR: You got money?

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.610
OK.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.335
All right.

00:12:55.335 --> 00:12:55.790
AUDIENCE: I got a lot of money.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.373
PROFESSOR: Oh, very
good, that's good.

00:12:57.373 --> 00:12:59.976
That's what we
like to hear here.

00:12:59.976 --> 00:13:01.600
AUDIENCE: That's what
he likes to hear.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.590
PROFESSOR: Everybody
make a choice.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.050
Heads or tails?

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.690
Now, you all want
to be thinking, OK,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.275
what's going on here?

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.400
We're going to figure out
expectations in a minute,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.191
do the tree method.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:15.080
Is there any catch going on?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.580
Not that we would
have a catch here.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.150
OK, put a heads or tails down.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.475
OK, coin toss please.

00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:24.210
AUDIENCE: Tails.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.920
PROFESSOR: Tails.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.160
What do we got?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.150
A winner, a winner, and a loser.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.130
So we got tails, tails, tails.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.210
Nick has lost another $2.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.840
Martyna's cruising and
Adam is back to even.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.900
Good job.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.110
AUDIENCE: Can I cash out now?

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.040
PROFESSOR: Well,
you're only even.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.354
You've got to get ahead here.

00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:51.562
All right, let's do it again.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.330
$2.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.676
Everybody got $2 on the table?

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.120
I'm going to have to loan.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.370
You got money?

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.870
You got it.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.100
OK.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.150
See, my hope is
Nick loses track.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.110
OK, make a choice please.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.690
Coin toss, please.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.520
AUDIENCE: Tails.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.228
PROFESSOR: Tails.

00:14:24.228 --> 00:14:25.770
What do we got?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.660
Heads.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.746
Martyna, Nick!

00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:31.360
Oh, for goodness sake.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.330
AUDIENCE: She's
psychic, I tell you.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.580
PROFESSOR: Martyna wins again.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.460
You didn't make a deal
with him, did you?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.270
PROFESSOR: Nick and Martyna are
perfect and Adam is down again.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.050
Let's collect your money.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.440
She gets it all.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.380
Oh, she got four here.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.590
Yeah, she made four.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.590
Good point.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.410
Because she won it all.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.610
Very good.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.981
All right, let's put
the next wager up.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.670
Nick, if I were you, I wouldn't
do much gambling in life.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.970
[LAUGHS] You got
any money left Adam?

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.582
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to have a big win.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:16.540
PROFESSOR: There it is.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.498
Working on the big win.

00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:18.660
There we go.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.510
AUDIENCE: I'm running
out of ones here.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.277
PROFESSOR: Martyna can
make change for you.

00:15:24.277 --> 00:15:25.360
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Martyna.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.010
Do you have change for a 10?

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.520
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.655
There we go.

00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:37.530
A couple bucks there.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.779
And then make your selections.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.380
Okey doke.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.550
It's a pretty fair game.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.860
They put the money in,
the winners split the pot.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.760
You guys flip the coin after
they make their selections.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.360
OK, make a selection.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.860
Martyna has hers.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.820
Adam's ready and Nick is ready.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.550
Can we have a coin toss?

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.550
AUDIENCE: Tails.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.390
PROFESSOR: Tails.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.006
What do we got?

00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:03.720
Nick!

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.440
Congratulations.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.450
Nick wins big.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.020
All right.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.790
Tails, heads, heads, tails.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.470
Nick, $4.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.050
He's climbing back.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.800
And Martyna lost for
the first time $2.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.320
Poor Adam is sinking
a little bit here.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.840
All right, one more.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.790
So who collects?

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.960
Nick, do you want
to collect this?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.920
Start paying off the debts,
but save $2 for the last round.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.690
This yours?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.867
Yeah, there's a last one.

00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:37.950
All right, two more bucks.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.704
Last round.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.535
OK, make your selections.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.920
Martyna's ready.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.700
Nick is ready.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.025
OK, Adam, what do you like?

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.290
Coin toss.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:58.962
AUDIENCE: Heads.

00:16:58.962 --> 00:16:59.670
PROFESSOR: Heads.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.930
How'd you do?

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.110
Oh Adam, tough break.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.580
Nick again.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.859
Nick is the sole winner.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.880
So he collects on the heads.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.119
All right, so it's plus $4
for Nick, minus 2 for Martina,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.880
minus 2 for Adam.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.980
All right, let's see
how they did in total.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.020
Oh, poor Adam.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.940
Minus $6 here.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.800
How did that happen?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.560
Martyna is plus $6.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.570
Now we know how it happened.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.655
And Nick is even.

00:17:40.266 --> 00:17:40.766
Even.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.050
Yeah, so that's just a
tough break for Adam.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.659
He came up here and lost $6.

00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:55.700
AUDIENCE: Interestingly,
there's $6 on the table.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.158
I think I should
take that and run.

00:17:57.158 --> 00:17:57.779
[LAUGHS]

00:17:57.779 --> 00:17:59.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you probably should.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.500
But I need to get paid
back from Nick here.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.420
Now obviously this is
a fair game, right?

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.760
So how many people think
that Adam was just unlucky?

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.010
A few.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.450
How many people think we
just screwed him out of $6?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.000
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.260
But let's do the analysis
to see what happened here.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.156
Meanwhile, I probably
should give him his $6.

00:18:26.156 --> 00:18:29.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.376
PROFESSOR: And you got my money.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:34.696
All right, so I have
a gift certificate,

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.570
if you would like, for
playing the game here.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.450
You can have this or you can
have the pocket protector.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.640
I got to say somebody's
last time turned

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.670
in this for one of these.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.560
The nerd pride pocket protector.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.700
So what would you
like for your memento?

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.408
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to take the box where

00:18:51.408 --> 00:18:53.040
[? David Chena ?] is standing.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.820
PROFESSOR: What?

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.280
AUDIENCE: As in [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.110
PROFESSOR: You get one
too for tossing the coin.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.810
So we'll pass this up.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.310
Here you go.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.010
Want to pass that up
for our coin tosser?

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.840
OK, very good.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.247
Thanks very much.

00:19:10.247 --> 00:19:11.330
Just leave the money here.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.377
Yeah.

00:19:12.377 --> 00:19:13.210
Leave my money here.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.420
Oh, we took some
out of your wallet.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.076
AUDIENCE: I got $5
money from you-- $5.

00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:17.868
PROFESSOR: $5 from me, yeah.

00:19:17.868 --> 00:19:19.312
All right, so leave me the $5.

00:19:19.312 --> 00:19:21.672
AUDIENCE: This is your $5.

00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:24.570
PROFESSOR: Oh, I should
give them back their $6.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.304
Well, otherwise they
could report me,

00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:27.220
and I'd be in trouble.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.450
And it's all on film.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.120
That would not be good.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.990
OK, so what we're going to
do now is analyze the game.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.320
And I'm going to
prove to you he was

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.520
just unlucky, despite
the fact that you

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.830
think I screwed him here.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.730
So we're going to analyze
Adam's expected winnings

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.910
playing this game.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:49.840
So let's do that.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.880
So we're going to make
the tree, as usual.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.500
Now, the first thing we
have is Adam's choice.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.467
Now, Adam were you doing
anything besides sort

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.300
of randomly picking?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.883
Were you trying to
psych out the coin?

00:20:07.784 --> 00:20:09.950
AUDIENCE: Apparently I
wouldn't be able to bribe him

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.370
from all the way down here.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
you did lose most of it.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.870
We'll say Adam
was playing 50-50.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.850
It's a reasonable assumption.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.550
And then we have
Martyna and then

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.010
we have Nick and their choices.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.530
And let's say they're 50-50
as well, because none of them

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.280
know what coin is
going to be tossed.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.571
And I'm not going to draw
this bottom half of the tree,

00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:35.000
but it's totally symmetric.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.060
It just gets too deep otherwise.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:45.230
And then we have Nick's choices,
heads, tails, heads, tails.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.027
And they're 50-50.

00:20:50.342 --> 00:20:51.425
And then we have the coin.

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.440
And I'll start
drawing it down here.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.197
And the coin can
be heads or tails.

00:20:57.197 --> 00:20:59.030
And we're going to
assume it was a fair coin

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.780
toss back there, because
it looked like it

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.320
was flipping a bunch of times.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.640
And you don't look
like Persi Diaconis,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.240
so we're going to
assume you didn't

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.150
learn how to flip heads always.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.118
So those are 50-50.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.330
A little tight here.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.370
Everything is 50-50.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.680
So the probabilities
are all 1/16.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.670
I got 16 possible outcomes.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.330
2 by 2 by 2 by 2.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.044
They're all equally likely.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.460
So all the
probabilities are 1/16.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.380
And now let's see the winnings.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.957
So we'll take Adam's game.

00:21:48.957 --> 00:21:50.207
It'll turn out to be negative.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.440
Now, in this case if Adam's
heads and Martyna and Nick

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.990
are heads and the coin comes
up heads, they all win,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.880
they split the pot.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.670
So how much is the gain
for Adam in that case?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.630
0.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.600
Now they all guessed heads,
but the coin comes out tails,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.720
so they split the pot.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.150
What's Adam's gain there?

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.240
0, because they just
split the pot again.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.350
He gets his $2 back.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.010
That's 0.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.430
Now we have a case
where Nick is tails,

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.100
Adam and Martyna were heads,
and it comes out heads.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.870
So Nick is losing here.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.500
The pot is split by
Adam and Martyna.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.540
What does Adam get as a profit?

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.040
1.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.290
He gets half the part because
he splits with Martyna.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:49.080
That's $3 he put into,
he gets 1, plus 1.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.710
Now it turns out same
scenario of guesses,

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.740
but it comes out tails,
so Nick wins everything.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.550
What's Adam's status here?

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.360
Minus 2.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.800
He bet $2, he lost it.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.000
Then we have heads for
Adam, tails for Martyna,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.330
heads for Nick.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:15.550
Coin comes up heads, Adam splits
with Nick, he gets a net of $1.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.300
Same scenario
guesses, but now it's

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.770
tails, so Martina wins
everything, Adam loses $2.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.180
Now we go down to
here where it's

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.650
heads for Adam, tails
for Martyna and Nick,

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.520
and heads comes up, so
Adam wins the whole thing.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.430
What does he get in this case?

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.020
Plus 4.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.640
He wins the whole
part of 6 minus 2.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.410
So he gets 4 net.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.690
And then lastly, in this
scenario it comes up tails

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.920
and Martina and Nick
split the pot, Adam loses.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.810
Minus 2.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.030
And then the same thing
is happening down here.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.860
Same thing.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.800
It's just everything is
reversed by symmetry.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.290
Now, they're all equally likely.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.380
So what we do to compute
the expected gain

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.290
is take each value times its
probability and add them up.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.420
So 0 times 1/16
plus 0 times 1/16

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.190
plus 1 times 1/16 minus 2
times 1/16 and so forth.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.450
So it's easier just to add
these up and multiply by 1/16.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.430
And when we do, we get 0.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.070
We get 0.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.510
If I add all these up, I get 0.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.420
The same thing for down here.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:34.050
So the expected
gain for Adam is 0.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.841
And that is a fair game.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.746
What do you think?

00:24:40.746 --> 00:24:42.620
Do you think we'd go to
all that trouble just

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.670
to play a fair game?

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.800
Or do you think we're trying to
set him up and take his money?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.666
Yeah.

00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:51.890
AUDIENCE: Martyna and
Nick are alternating,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.824
so the branch with
the plus 4 goes away.

00:24:53.824 --> 00:24:55.240
PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.396
Look what happened here.

00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:09.350
Nick and Martina,
well, they're opposite.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.290
That's opposite.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.090
That's opposite.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.180
That's opposite.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.050
You don't suppose they
planned that, do you?

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.620
And how could that possibly
help that they just

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.414
happened to guess opposite?

00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:25.830
AUDIENCE: One of
them always wins.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.920
PROFESSOR: One of
them always wins.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.956
And what does that
mean for poor Adam?

00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:31.580
AUDIENCE: He never
takes the whole pot.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.660
PROFESSOR: He never
takes the whole pot.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.430
Well, all right.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.050
Let's see if that
changed anything here.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.950
So if Nick and
Martyna are always

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.260
opposite, that means some of
these branches can't occur.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.760
So if Martyna's heads,
Nick is tails, this is out.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.100
So this is happening
with probability 1 now.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:02.210
So these points are at
1/8 each instead of 1/16.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.770
And these go to 0 because
that branch can't happen.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.490
Same thing here.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.290
When you go tails to
Martyna, Nick can't be tails,

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.110
has to be heads.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.590
So these go to 1/8.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.755
These go to 0.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.190
Now, you notice this isn't
working out so well for Adam

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.830
because we're putting
more weight here

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.750
where he's got a net negative
compared to an even situation.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.200
And here he's gone from a
positive situation, that's

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.380
getting wiped out
to a net negative.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.960
So let's compute
his probability now.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.480
And I'll get the same
contribution down here.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:49.760
I've got 1 minus 2 plus 1
of 0 minus 2 is negative 2.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.760
I'll get a negative 2
down here times 1/8.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.080
In this case, I'll
have the expected gain

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.330
for Adam is going to be minus.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.270
Let's make sure I do this right.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:09.130
It's going to be 2 for the
top and bottom times 1/8

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.560
times these guys.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.110
1 minus 2 plus 1 minus 2.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.890
And that equals minus 2.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:21.880
That's minus 1/2.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.600
So in fact, if they come up
here and guess differently,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.330
who knew?

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.610
Now the expected gain
for Adam is minus $0.50.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:42.420
Every time he plays, he expects
to lose $0.50 on his $2 bet.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.290
That's a lousy game for
Adam to be playing, even

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.830
though it seemed very fair.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.680
You see what's going on here?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.790
Now, this kind of trick is used
in all sorts of gambling games.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.790
Maybe you've probably
played some of these games

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.623
and may not have realized
maybe somebody was

00:28:02.623 --> 00:28:05.240
using this trick against you.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.640
For example, how
many of you have

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.424
been in some kind of
sports betting pool?

00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:11.840
It's March Madness,
you're betting

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.350
on the victors in round one.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.180
It's a football pool
for the weekend.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.550
You're going to guess
against the spread.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.341
Who's going to win?

00:28:19.341 --> 00:28:21.420
All right, some of
you have done that.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.160
All right, now everybody
puts $1 into the pool.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.110
And the winner is the
guy who was the most wins

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.330
or games picked right.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.240
All the winners split the pot.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.380
Now, what this says, by doing
the same kind of analysis we

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.430
just did, is that if you
collude with one or two or three

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.260
other players in the pool
to always pick differently

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.170
on all the games, it's
going to give you an edge.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.330
Same reasoning.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.280
When they pick differently,
it gives them an edge

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.580
and now your expected
return is bigger than 0,

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.080
at the expense of
the other players who

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.640
just go in and are
putting their picks, if we

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.340
assume each one is 50-50.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.590
In fact, a former professor
of statistics here at MIT

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:12.030
used this idea, a guy named
Herman Chernoff, in the 1980s

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.190
to beat the state lottery.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.600
Now, everyone knows
that lotteries

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.430
are the worst game around
because everybody puts

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.080
the money in, the
state takes half,

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.850
and then the winners
split the pot.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.540
So it's a horrendous game.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.190
Your expected return is
half of what you put in.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.850
So you expect to lose half your
bet, because the state's taking

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:38.830
half and splitting the remainder
among all the participants.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:45.170
Now, what Chernoff realized is
that people don't bet randomly.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.540
They tend to pick the
same sets of numbers.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.780
It might be a birthday.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.500
There's only so many
birthdays out there.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.660
Might be number of
home runs Papi's hit,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.530
his batting average,
Pabelbon's ERA.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.100
Who knows?

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.880
But they pick a
relatively small set

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.620
of numbers that
tend to collapse on.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:14.370
In fact, if you graph
how people tend to pick.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.010
And say you're
playing pick four,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.187
where you pick four numbers.

00:30:18.187 --> 00:30:20.020
And now you look at the
frequency with which

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.690
the numbers are picked.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.090
Very crudely it looks
something like this.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.230
Every once in a while
you get a hot ticket

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.890
where a lot of people
pick that number.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.940
For example, if you're
picking four numbers,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.422
MIT students might
pick 2, 4, 6, 16.

00:30:39.422 --> 00:30:41.380
They might pick that and
so it'd be a big spike

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.070
for that set of four.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.274
Down the street they're
probably picking in 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:30:47.274 --> 00:30:49.190
Something like that and
there's a spike there.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.550
If you knew this was
the histogram of what

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.640
people were picking and
you knew half the pot was

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.430
going to get split with the
winners, what would you pick?

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.215
Would you pick these?

00:31:05.215 --> 00:31:07.590
No, because now you're splitting
the pot with 100 people.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.190
That's no good.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.640
You pick down here.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.202
And now when you win,
you get half the pot.

00:31:15.202 --> 00:31:17.160
The state always takes
half, but you don't have

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.470
to split it with anybody else.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.950
And that means if you're
picking down here,

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.820
your expected
return is positive,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.640
even with the state taking half.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.330
Because so much of the money
is piled up in these things.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.910
And so Chernoff proved
that in fact, he

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.550
didn't know which
numbers were popular.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.960
He didn't know that.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.009
So what did he do?

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:44.050
If you don't know where
the spikes are but you're

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.350
trying to avoid them and
there's not very many spikes,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.470
what would you do to avoid them?

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.637
Pick random.

00:31:51.637 --> 00:31:53.970
Because if you pick random,
probably you miss the spike.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.680
You're down here.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.680
With a number nobody would
have thought to pick,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.430
if some random number.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.240
And he showed that, in
fact, if you pick randomly,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.870
your expected gain for
the lottery at the time

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.500
was 7%, or $0.7 on the dollar.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500
So positive even with
the state taking half.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.160
Now, shortly after that,
you saw the proliferation

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.970
of these random machines that
we create random numbers.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.090
Because the state wanted
to balance it out and not

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.310
have this kind of a scenario.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.910
So now a lot of the
picks are randomly

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.570
generated in a lot
of the lotteries.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.280
These things are not
immediately obvious,

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:42.240
but become very clear once you
know the mathematics behind it.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.860
Any questions?

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.645
Yeah.

00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:47.900
AUDIENCE: How would a
person hit a random number?

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.870
PROFESSOR: Oh, you go to
your favorite computer

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.290
and do a random
number generator.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.490
Now, that's not
perfectly random.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.050
People do get into
a science of this

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.512
where they're
certain cosmic rays

00:32:58.512 --> 00:33:00.470
or whatever hitting the
earth and the frequency

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.136
they try to get random
numbers out of it

00:33:02.136 --> 00:33:04.220
or certain kinds
of clocks and stuff

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.090
like that, the tiny
low order bits.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.069
Actually getting really
independent random numbers

00:33:10.069 --> 00:33:10.860
can be challenging.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.140
A lot of the things you do
with a computer generating

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.140
random numbers, they're
distributed nicely,

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.850
but they're not
mutually independent.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.250
And there's whole texts
that go into how to do

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.385
that for mutual independence.

00:33:22.385 --> 00:33:24.260
Getting something that's
fair for one of them

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.100
is not too hard.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.920
Any questions about that?

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.970
There's another example.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.920
How many people
ever participated

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.090
in a Super Bowl bet?

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.810
OK, like maybe you're trying to
guess the over under on point

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.930
scored.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.050
And the person who guesses close
to the total number of points

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.370
wins the pot.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:50.760
And if there's a
tie, it's shared.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.490
So in that kind of
situation, some people

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.570
figured out that the average
number of points scored

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.860
in a Super Bowl is, say, 30.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:07.730
And a lot of the guesses then
will cluster around 30 points.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.840
Now, if you knew this and you
knew a lot of the guesses,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.639
because there may be people who
cared betting, where would you

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.560
make, say, this is, I don't
know, 40 and this is 20,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.440
where would you guess?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.480
You could guess here.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.120
That's a good one.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.620
Or you could guess here.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.448
Not only are you not going to
share the pot, which helps you,

00:34:27.448 --> 00:34:29.739
but in this case you'd
actually, because being closest,

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:32.630
you'd capture all
the scores out here.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.870
So that's really good.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.198
So these are the best guesses to
make for your expected return,

00:34:38.198 --> 00:34:40.489
assuming everybody is guessing
around here because they

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:41.880
know that's the median.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.846
Yeah?

00:34:42.846 --> 00:34:45.384
AUDIENCE: But those scores
aren't likely to happen.

00:34:45.384 --> 00:34:47.050
PROFESSOR: They're
not likely to happen,

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.159
but it can outweigh splitting
the pot with all the people

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.870
that guessed here.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.744
And you get to cover more bases.

00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:58.660
So you're right, they're
less likely to happen

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.170
because so many people guessed
in here where it's likely.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.790
Your expected return
is better out here.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.750
You may not be likely
to win, but your payoff

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.790
will be very large when you do.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.590
Now, if you're in
a bet or a pool

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.400
with a bunch of 6042
students and they're all

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.542
guessing out here, well then
you want to go back home here.

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:23.250
Then it's better.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:28.800
So it all depends on what
that distribution looks like.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.660
All right, any more
questions about this?

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.672
Yeah.

00:35:32.672 --> 00:35:34.213
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
if you're going

00:35:34.213 --> 00:35:35.883
to be playing a
whole bunch of times,

00:35:35.883 --> 00:35:37.758
and if you're only
playing once, wouldn't you

00:35:37.758 --> 00:35:40.158
look at the most likely result?

00:35:40.158 --> 00:35:41.408
PROFESSOR: Say that again now?

00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:43.929
AUDIENCE: If you're going to be
only playing once wouldn't you

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:45.595
only be concerned
with the result that's

00:35:45.595 --> 00:35:47.606
most likely to show up?

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:49.480
PROFESSOR: Well, it
depends on your strategy.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.580
If you want the expected
gain to be maximized,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.760
it doesn't matter how
many times you're playing.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.400
And that can be very
different than maximizing

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.480
your probability of winning.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.210
If you want to maximize
your probability of winning,

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:06.165
you're going to go right
at the center point here.

00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:08.290
Because if you look at the
probability distribution

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:12.572
and say the probability
distribution looks like that,

00:36:12.572 --> 00:36:14.280
then you want to bet
here, because that's

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.390
the maximum chance of winning.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:22.250
But say so many people bet
there, you'd split 30 ways.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:27.260
Well, this divided by 30 is
smaller than this divided by 1.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.280
And so your expected return
will be bigger out here.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.500
So two different things.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.160
Maximizing the probability
of winning and maximizing

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.830
your expected return.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:37.394
Yeah?

00:36:37.394 --> 00:36:38.810
AUDIENCE: When you
say maximizing,

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.144
do you just do derivatives?

00:36:41.144 --> 00:36:43.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then
you could do derivatives

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.840
and all that kind of stuff.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.350
That's right.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.141
Once you have the curve,
you figure it out.

00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:47.820
Yeah.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.551
Yeah.

00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:50.342
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
be better to maximize

00:36:50.342 --> 00:36:56.115
your expected value versus
the probability that you win?

00:36:56.115 --> 00:36:56.740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.160
In general, you want to
maximize the expected return

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.170
on the basis that
probably over life you're

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.950
doing lots of things.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:06.990
And that overall puts
you in a better state.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.110
Now, we're going
to talk about this

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:14.750
some next time in terms
of taking high risk

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.860
bets with high, high payoffs.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.370
That can maximize
your expected return,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.230
but you have a very decent
chance of losing a lot.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.840
And so you might not
want to go there.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.423
And we'll talk about
that next time we

00:37:26.423 --> 00:37:29.790
talk about variance and
actually what your choice is.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.110
Because that is a
fundamental choice you face.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.760
Maximizing chance of winning,
maximizing expected return.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.970
And of course, tied into
that is the risk of losing

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.011
and what kind of risk
you're willing to tolerate.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.050
We're going to do a bunch more
examples, but before I do,

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.810
I want to show you
some other equivalent

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.940
definitions of expectation.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.150
So the expected value
of a random variable,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.290
you can also compute
it by summing over

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.400
all possible values of
the random variable.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.600
x being in the range of
R. x times the probability

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.330
that R equals x.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.200
And let's see why this is true.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.058
It follows from the definition.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.270
From the definition, we
know the expected value

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.600
is the sum over
all sample points

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.970
of the value of the random
variable on the sample

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.365
point times its probability.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:46.880
And now we can organize this
sum by the value that R takes.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.480
So we're going to split
this into a double sum

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:57.330
where here we're looking
first at x in the range of R.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:02.030
And then here we look at
sample points for which R

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.380
on that point is x.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.220
So this sum is
equivalent to this one.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.970
Here we're just
organizing all the sample

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.345
points for the same value of x.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.430
All right, now in
the inner sum, I've

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.140
only got values for which
R w equals x, so I can just

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.410
replace this with x.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.860
The same as before.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.575
Only now I've just
put x instead of Rw.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.805
Now I can pull the x out since
it's a constant independent

00:40:05.805 --> 00:40:06.670
of that sum.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:27.280
Now here I'm summing up the
probability of all the sample

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.100
points for which R of
the sample point is x.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.890
And that is just the
probability that R equals x.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.540
That's the definition of the
probability of that event.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.310
And so now my answer
is some overall values

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.177
x in the range of x times
of probability R equals x.

00:40:48.177 --> 00:40:49.760
And that's what I
was trying to prove.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.990
OK, any questions about that?

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.230
Now there are some
special cases of this

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:07.917
when the random variable
is on the natural numbers.

00:41:07.917 --> 00:41:09.625
So the range of R is
the natural numbers.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.631
So a corollary.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:33.400
If the random variable has a
range on the natural numbers,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.560
then another way to compute
the expected value of r

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.640
is to simply sum i equals
1 to infinity i times

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.760
the probability R equals i.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.190
And the proof, well, it's really
just saying the same thing

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.890
here.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.160
I'm just summing over
the natural numbers.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.140
And the case with
0 doesn't matter

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.830
because I get 0 times
the probability of 0.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.390
And that adds
nothing to the sum.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:09.390
So I just have to sum over the
positive integers in that case.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.620
All right, there's
another special case

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.060
of this, which
makes it even easier

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.600
sometimes to compute
the expected value.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:46.260
If R is a random variable
in the natural numbers,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.570
then the expected
value of R is simply

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:56.240
the sum i equals 0 to
infinity of the probability

00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.400
the random variable
is bigger than i.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.755
Which is the same as summing
i equals 1 to infinity,

00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:09.300
the probability R is
bigger than or equal to i.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.077
They're the same thing.

00:43:11.077 --> 00:43:13.160
For example, the first
term here, your probability

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.750
R bigger than 0.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.510
That's the same as saying R
is bigger than or equal to 1

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.220
and so forth.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.000
So these are clearly the same.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.760
And the difference
here is we have i times

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.230
probability R equals i.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.990
Here we have probability
R is bigger than I,

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.120
with no i out in front.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.328
So let's see why that's true.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.460
Well, we're going to work
backwards and evaluate

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.830
that sum.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:13.350
The sum i equal 0 to infinity
probability R is bigger than i.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:17.250
Well, that's the
probability R is bigger

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.450
than 0 plus the
probability R is bigger

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:27.700
than 1 plus probability
R is bigger than 2,

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.133
and so forth out to infinity.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.340
Adding those up.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.910
And now I can
write this one out.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:43.250
That's the probability R
equals 1 plus the probability R

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:49.666
equals 2 plus the probability
R equals 3 and so forth.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:58.110
Probability are bigger than
1 equals, well, R could be 2,

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:03.760
R could be 3, and so forth.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.460
R bigger than 2.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:12.010
Well, R could be
3, 4, and so forth.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:18.110
And so now if I
add all these up,

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:23.780
well, I get 1 times
probability R equals 1.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.910
Two of these guys.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.400
Three of these guys.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.042
And you can see
the pattern here.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.810
Before the next and so forth.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:45.150
And so we've shown that this
value equals that value, which

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:54.635
is by the corollary just
the expected value of R.

00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:57.010
So by the corollary, we know
that the expected value of R

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.188
equals the sum up there.

00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:01.688
And that's the proof
of the theorem.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.280
Sometimes it's easier to use
that top expression there.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.610
And as a good example, it
gives a really easy way

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:19.690
to compute the mean time
to failure in a system.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:20.548
So let's do that.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:42.020
Suppose you have a system and
it fails with probability p

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.210
at each step.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.160
And let's assume
that the failures

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.500
are mutually independent.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.340
So if the system has
been going for t steps,

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.700
it still will fail on step
t plus 1 with probability p,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.380
no matter what's
happened before.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.950
And the question is, what's
the expected number of steps

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.330
before the system fails?

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.680
How long is it going to
live before you get a crash?

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.720
And we're going to let R
be that random variable.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:17.000
It will be the step when
failure occurs, first failure.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.770
We want to know what's the
expected value of R. Mean time

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:29.336
to failure.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:36.350
And we're going to use
that top formula up there.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.807
Makes it a lot
simpler to do that

00:47:38.807 --> 00:47:39.932
than the other definitions.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:50.130
Now, the probability
that R is bigger than i

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.520
is the same as the
probability it did not

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.396
fail in the first i steps.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:08.465
So this equals the probability
of no failure in the first i

00:48:08.465 --> 00:48:08.965
steps.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.840
Because this event,
R bigger than i

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.840
means that the first failure
was not in the first steps,

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.380
so the system was fine
for the first i steps.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.970
And because of
mutual independence

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.110
on when failure
occurs, this is simply

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:37.140
the product that we're OK,
no failure in the first step

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.600
times the probability.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:47.800
We're OK in the second step and
so forth up to the ith step.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.134
We're OK in ith step.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.040
And this is where we're
using mutual independence,

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.420
because I've gone
from a situation where

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.990
we're OK in the first i steps.

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:02.280
The probability of that is the
product of the probabilities.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.860
We're OK in each
step individually.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.213
So that needed independents.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:13.410
Well, what is the probability
we're OK in the first step?

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:21.208
What's the probability of
no failure on step one?

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:24.950
1 minus p, because p is the
probability we did fail.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:28.120
So we're OK with
probability 1 minus p.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.930
What is the probability
we're OK in the second step?

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:39.040
1 minus p and so
forth for all i steps.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.480
So this is 1 minus p to the eye.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:48.960
And it's usually simpler to
write that as alpha to the i

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.200
where alpha equals 1 minus p.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:59.150
Because what we've got
here now is the sum.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:02.360
Expected value of R
is a sum, i equals 0

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:10.990
to infinity of that probability,
which is just alpha to the i.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.280
And we all know what
that sum is, right?

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.040
What's that sum?

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.985
1 over 1 minus alpha.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.790
And that plug back in
the alpha to be 1 minus

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:32.702
p is 1 over 1 minus 1 minus p.

00:50:32.702 --> 00:50:33.660
And that's very simple.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.300
That's 1 over p.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.310
So the expected time to
fail, the expected step

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.210
of when you're going to
fail, is 1 over p where

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.500
p is the failure probability.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.120
So for example, if you have a 1%
chance of failing on any step,

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.510
your mean time to
failure is what?

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.322
100.

00:50:55.322 --> 00:50:57.260
1 over 0.01.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:01.870
So very easy to compute
mean time to failure.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:06.264
Any questions about that?

00:51:06.264 --> 00:51:08.430
Of course, you can do it
with the other definitions,

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.660
but the calculations are
a little more painful.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.573
Yeah.

00:51:12.573 --> 00:51:13.906
AUDIENCE: Why are we summing it?

00:51:13.906 --> 00:51:17.250
Is it like an accumulative
solution basically?

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.860
PROFESSOR: Why are we summing?

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.830
Well, that's the definition.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:25.930
The theorem says the expected
value of a random variable

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:30.832
is the sum of the probability
that it's bigger than i.

00:51:30.832 --> 00:51:32.040
That's what the theorem says.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.540
So we're just plugging
into the theorem.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.420
And then the theorem
was proved based

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:42.020
on the corollary, which came
from the theorem and then

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.129
the definition.

00:51:43.129 --> 00:51:44.670
So we went through
a series of steps.

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.510
We started with a definition
of expected value, which

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.599
makes sense.

00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:50.140
Then we got another
way to compute it

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.181
based on that definition.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.782
And then a corollary
to that and then

00:51:56.782 --> 00:51:58.490
we use the corollary
to prove another way

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.710
of computing expected values.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.754
We went through a
bunch of general steps

00:52:01.754 --> 00:52:03.670
and then we used, basically
you could use this

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.354
as a definition of this
point for expected value.

00:52:06.354 --> 00:52:08.020
And it just says you
sum those things up

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.978
and you get the answer.

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.568
Any other questions?

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.380
OK, there's a variation
on this problem

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.890
that you see all the time
in sort of trick questions

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:25.650
or in the popular
press sometime, that

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:27.220
often confuses people.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.630
People sometimes think
of it as a paradox,

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:31.930
though it's not really one.

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:34.060
And the example's something
like the following.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.610
Say that a couple, they're
going to have kids.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.890
What they really
want is a baby girl.

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.390
They get a boy,
fine, but that's not

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.598
what they're concerned about.

00:52:41.598 --> 00:52:43.440
They want to have a baby girl.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.310
And let's say that
each time they have

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.300
a kid it's 50-50 boy or girl.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.710
And let's say that it's
mutually independent from one

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.380
kid to the next, which
is not true in practice.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.735
There tends to be correlation.

00:52:55.735 --> 00:52:57.860
But let's assume it's
mutually independent from one

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.500
kid to the next.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.750
Now, if on the first
try a couple get a girl,

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.110
great, they're done, they
have one kid, that's it,

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.680
because they just wanted a girl.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.140
If they get a boy,
OK, try again.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.890
And they keep trying again
until they get the girl,

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:16.480
even if it's 50 kids.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.570
They wait till
they get the girl.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.830
And the question is,
how many baby boys

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:27.190
do you expect to get
before you have the girl?

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.690
what's?

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:32.461
The expected number of boys to
get the girl, then you quit?

00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:37.331
So let's do that.

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.735
So we want to know.

00:53:49.735 --> 00:53:52.690
We have the following data.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:57.860
The probability of a boy is 1/2.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.838
You keep having boys until
you get a girl, then you quit.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.527
We're going to let R
be the random variable

00:54:10.527 --> 00:54:11.485
for the number of boys.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:21.290
And everything is mutually
independent from one child

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.300
to the next.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:28.430
How many people think you expect
to have more boys than the one

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.330
girl?

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.680
You keep having boys
till you get the girl.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.880
Most people think this.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.390
How many people think you expect
to have fewer than one boy?

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.630
Nobody.

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.136
How many people think you
expect to have an equal number?

00:54:43.136 --> 00:54:44.160
Expect one boy.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.140
Good, OK, so that's the answer.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.700
In fact, you expect
to have just one boy.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.859
And the proof, we sort
of just did it here.

00:54:52.859 --> 00:54:54.650
Now, in this case,
we're going to set it up

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.460
as a mean time to failure.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.480
Same kind of thing.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.950
Now, in this case the failure
mode, they want the girl,

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:05.640
but that's when you stop,
so that's the failure mode.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.210
And a working step
is you have a boy

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.860
and you keep having the
working steps until you have

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.570
failure mode and then you stop.

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.630
And in this case,
we're not counting

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.610
the step when you stop.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:19.270
So we know from that that
the expected value of R

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:22.620
is 1 over p, which
is going to be 1/2.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.420
That's the number of
children you have.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.170
And that equals the
mean time to failure.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:34.250
Minus the girl.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:37.810
Because you count the girl
as one of the children.

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:40.039
And that's going to be the
expected number of boys.

00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:41.580
So number of children
you're expected

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.880
to have minus the girl.

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.770
This is 1 over 1/2.

00:55:49.115 --> 00:55:53.330
And that is 2 minus 1 equals 1.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:58.770
So you expect to have one
boy before you get the girl.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:02.930
Any questions on that?

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:06.180
OK, how about this?

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.840
Some couples want to have
at least one of each sex.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.530
They want to have at least
one boy and one girl.

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.170
So they keep having children
until they get one of each

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.170
and then they stop.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.210
How many children do
they expect to have?

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:27.580
Somebody said two.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.820
That's a minimum number.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.380
So it's not likely to
be the expected number.

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.580
Three.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.730
Well, OK, who said three?

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.030
Why do you think three?

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:42.848
AUDIENCE: Because you have to
have at least the first two,

00:56:42.848 --> 00:56:45.820
so it can be greater than one.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.302
I mean, one probability
is greater than one child,

00:56:48.302 --> 00:56:50.534
one probability is
greater than two children.

00:56:50.534 --> 00:56:55.080
And after that it's halves
which add up to one.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.163
That's a good proof.

00:56:57.163 --> 00:56:58.000
Very good.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:58.850
That'll work.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.838
Yeah, yeah.

00:56:59.838 --> 00:57:01.421
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what

00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:02.383
you were doing before.

00:57:02.383 --> 00:57:05.429
If you were to switch your
expectations for a girl

00:57:05.429 --> 00:57:07.674
and boy, wouldn't it come
out to the same number

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:10.570
but wouldn't it kind
of contradict itself?

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.940
PROFESSOR: No, if you stopped
as soon as you had a boy,

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.780
you'd expect to have one
girl before you got a boy.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.057
Totally symmetric.

00:57:17.057 --> 00:57:19.140
In this case, we're stopping
when we get the girl,

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.560
so we expect to have one boy.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.354
You might have none, you might
have one, you might have two.

00:57:24.354 --> 00:57:26.770
and as he mentions, if you put
the probabilities in there,

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.000
they will work
out the right way,

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.291
but we just did it simpler
by the mean time to failure.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.910
And in fact, there's
also another proof,

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.220
what you're doing.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.530
Another way to think
about how many kids

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:41.400
you have to get one of each.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.880
Well you have the first kid.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.260
And now you have this
problem, because you

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.200
want one of the other sex.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.980
And you keep on trying to
get one of the other sex

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.850
and you expect to
have two children

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:57.090
to get one of the other sex.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.420
So you have one to start.

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.760
Whatever it is doesn't matter.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.690
And now you expect
to have two more

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:03.280
until you hit the other sex.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.970
So a total of three is the
expected number of children

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:10.985
to get one boy and
one girl, at least.

00:58:10.985 --> 00:58:13.314
Any questions about expectation?

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:22.010
OK, let's do another example.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.120
This comes up all the
time in experimental work.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.540
Probably all of you are going to
have some example at some point

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:33.050
where you're going to
do a problem like this.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:37.020
And most all the time,
people do it wrong.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.520
So let's see an example.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.390
Say that you want to measure the
latency of some communications

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.410
channel.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:49.490
And you want to know
what's the average latency.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.570
So you set up an experiment.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.180
You send a package
to the channel,

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.740
you measure when it started,
when it got to the other end,

00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.900
and you record the answer,
and then you do it 100 times

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.940
and you take the average.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.270
And you say that's the expected
latency of the channel.

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:10.827
Very, very typical kind of thing
to do, and sometimes OK to do.

00:59:10.827 --> 00:59:12.160
So you'd do something like this.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.690
You pick a random
variable D, which

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:23.197
is going to denote the
delay of a packet going

00:59:23.197 --> 00:59:24.030
through the channel.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.010
And there's, of course,
some underlying distribution

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.990
here, which we'll
denote by f of x.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.500
And that's just the
probability that D equals x.

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.510
That's the probability
distribution function.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:49.120
And as part of doing
your stuff, you

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.110
notice that if I
look at plot f here,

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:58.320
if I look at x on that
axis and f of x here,

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.045
it looks something like this.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:05.100
The chance of
getting the observed

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.290
cases where I got a long delay
were small, low probability.

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:11.890
And almost all the time
I got a short delay.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.540
So very typically you'll get
a curve that looks something

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.430
like that in terms
of the observations

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.600
of your experiment.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.930
And say that you do your
experiment 100 times

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.710
and the average latency
was 10 milliseconds.

01:00:31.887 --> 01:00:33.720
And sometimes you want
to be really careful,

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.150
so you do the whole thing
again, you do another 100 times.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.190
And maybe it's nine
milliseconds the next time.

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:41.280
And that sort of
confirms your belief

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.250
that your first
experiment was valid

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.430
and that the expected
latency on this channel

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:48.510
is 10 milliseconds.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.390
Sounds pretty good.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.710
But it can be completely wrong.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.390
And not just because
you're unlucky,

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:57.870
but because you're taking
a simple method like that.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:04.400
And let me show you an
example where it is way off.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:17.210
All right, say you
were just a little more

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.350
sophisticated about this.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:22.010
And when you did
your observations,

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:26.930
you tried to figure out what
this curve really looks like.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.090
And say that you,
looking at the data,

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.330
concluded that the probability
that you have a delay of more

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:37.610
than i milliseconds is 1 and i.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:41.480
That looks like this curve,
as close as anything.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.234
So from your data,
you conclude this.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.150
That's a little more
sophisticated conclusion,

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:49.300
because now you've
identified what

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.560
you believe the
distribution is, which

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.000
is stronger than expectation.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.754
How would you go about
figuring out the expected value

01:01:58.754 --> 01:01:59.920
if you had that information?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.380
I mean, you could average
the 100 sample points.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.550
But is there any way, if you
assume this, what would you

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.680
do for the expected value?

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.500
Yeah, did I erase the theorem?

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.870
No, it's over there.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:22.190
We just plug it to the theorem.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.590
The expected delay
is going to be

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:29.800
the sum of those probabilities
from 1 to infinity.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.760
So we would compute
from the theorem

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.626
the expected delay is i equals
1 to infinity probability.

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.804
Do I want to do the 0 case?

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.970
Want to be sure I don't get
caught up in the 0 case.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.560
We'll use the case
1 to infinity.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.070
Probability D greater
than or equal to i.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.960
So let me put greater
than or equal to here.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:02.220
That equals the sum i equals
1 to infinity of 1 over i.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.220
What's that?

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:11.630
What's the sum of 1 over
i, i from 1 to infinity?

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.290
It's infinite.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.830
Remember those harmonic number?

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.120
i going from 1 to n
gives you about log n.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.290
Remember that, the
book stacking thing?

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:28.620
i going from 1 to
infinity, that's infinity.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.070
So in fact, your expected
latency is infinite.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.720
And you just published a paper
saying it was 10 milliseconds,

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.450
maybe nine.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.460
So it's very dangerous to just
take a bunch of the points,

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.904
add them up, and average them
and say that is the answer.

01:03:47.904 --> 01:03:49.320
Especially if you
have some reason

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.130
to believe the distribution
looks like this

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:52.671
and it really is
something like that.

01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.844
It could be infinite.

01:03:54.844 --> 01:03:57.010
Now in some cases, if your
distribution is very well

01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:58.970
behaved, averaging
your sample points

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.320
is the perfect thing to do.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.183
But it helps to know it's not
necessarily the case that's

01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:06.090
a good way to go.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.518
Any ideas what went wrong?

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:11.018
Yeah.

01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:12.184
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:04:12.184 --> 01:04:14.290
What would be your
probability be over i squared?

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:15.956
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
would happen then?

01:04:15.956 --> 01:04:19.700
If in fact, it was
1 over i squared.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.457
So you need to do this sum.

01:04:26.457 --> 01:04:28.290
Here's a good review
question for the final.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.110
What method do you
use to estimate that?

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:35.360
Remember the how do we do that?

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.540
Is that infinite?

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.580
No.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.250
He used the integration bound.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:45.072
And you'll see what
this is pretty small.

01:04:45.072 --> 01:04:46.780
It'll be, what, 1 and
a 1/2, 2, something

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.660
like that where we can do
the integration method here.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.890
So huge difference.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:52.740
This is O of 1.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.190
This is bounded.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:58.760
Probably less than 2, if we
did the integration method.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:02.650
So huge difference here
in what the outcome is.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:07.120
Now, how can it be
that I've got something

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.150
with expected infinite value
and I average 100 points

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.180
and I got 10 milliseconds?

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.130
Yeah.

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:18.130
AUDIENCE: The infinite
value comes from the fact

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.973
that there is a
decent probability

01:05:20.973 --> 01:05:23.228
that delay is going to be huge.

01:05:23.228 --> 01:05:26.306
However, if you only take a
finite number of sample points,

01:05:26.306 --> 01:05:28.828
then chances are
you're not going

01:05:28.828 --> 01:05:30.790
to get any monstrous delays.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.010
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.670
The chance of seeing anything
beyond 100 milliseconds

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.886
is 1 in 100.

01:05:37.886 --> 01:05:39.260
So I'm probably
not going to see.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.530
In a sample size of
100, almost surely

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:46.550
I won't see something that takes
a second, 1,000 milliseconds.

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:49.470
But yet it's those
rare sample points

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:52.620
that are causing
that sum to blow up.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.150
If I sum that from 1 to
100, I get log of 10.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.742
Pretty small.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:04.082
So I get log of 100,
which is pretty small.

01:06:04.082 --> 01:06:06.290
So what's happening when
you do your finite sample is

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.950
you're missing
the big guys which

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:12.130
are very rare, but enough
to blow up your expectation.

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.020
Now, you can draw two
conclusions from that.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.250
One of them is just we did.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.640
The other is,
well, expectation's

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.534
the wrong measure.

01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:19.950
And really what
we should be doing

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:23.939
is looking at only 1,000 sample
points or something like that.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.230
But in practice of using the
thing over and over again,

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.480
eventually you're going
to get hit with a whopper.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.630
Sometimes you'll see
people take data points out

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.730
when they're really
the big ones.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.520
They say, oh, well,
that was an anomaly.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.293
I take that out and then
we compute the average.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:37.792
Yeah?

01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:39.458
AUDIENCE: How much
would you pay to play

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:43.115
a game where the pair would the
be the latency of the packet?

01:06:43.115 --> 01:06:44.073
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:06:44.073 --> 01:06:45.614
AUDIENCE: How much
do you pay to play

01:06:45.614 --> 01:06:48.080
a game where the pair would
be the latency of the packet?

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:48.955
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.810
That's a big number.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.170
If that was my losses
here, that's tough.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.500
I'd bet anything
up against that.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.730
To get a payoff of infinity?

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.260
You'd pay $1,000
to play that game.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.040
Now, you'd want to
play it for a long time

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.050
to get that big payoff, right?

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.420
But eventually that's
what it's going to be.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:19.860
Any questions?

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.040
People understand the
issue here and what

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.650
to worry about when you
all do that someday?

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:26.234
Yeah.

01:07:26.234 --> 01:07:27.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, now here
you don't know for a fact

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:36.600
this is it.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.640
But you could model and
you start seeing these.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.160
You fill in the points and
you say, it looks like this,

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.304
let's assume that's what it
was, then here's the result.

01:07:45.304 --> 01:07:47.470
If it looks like it's 1
over i squared, you can say,

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.700
let's assume that's what
it is and then you get

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.050
a different result. But
you take the various cases

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.210
and consider them to do it.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:59.200
Or you could say, I take the
expectation assuming I never

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.270
get a point bigger than 100.

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:03.540
And I limit it that way.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.242
And then you're
safe at that point

01:08:05.242 --> 01:08:06.450
and you can get away with it.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.241
But to blindly go out
there and say here it

01:08:08.241 --> 01:08:10.113
is, not so reliable.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:20.410
The expected value does have
a lot of useful properties.

01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:25.510
And the most important is
called linearity of expectation.

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:27.863
And we'll spend the rest of
today and some of next time

01:08:27.863 --> 01:08:28.571
talking about it.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.910
And quite possibly it's
one of the reasons people

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.899
use it so much instead of other
things you might think about.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.319
The theorem, and this may be
the most important theorem

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:55.973
on probability.

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:13.420
For any random variables, R1 and
R2, on a probability space S,

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:21.890
the expected value of R1 plus R2
equals the expected value of R1

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:26.290
plus the expected value of R2.

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.547
Very simple.

01:09:27.547 --> 01:09:29.130
It's another way of
saying expectation

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:32.080
is a linear function.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:32.579
The proof.

01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:38.330
No, skip the proof here.

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:39.981
It's not hard and
it's in the text.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.864
Follows pretty simply
from the definition.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:57.067
There's a generalization for
more than two random variables.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:00.997
So corollary.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:12.390
For all k in the natural numbers
and k random variables R1,

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:18.920
R2, up to Rk on the
sample probability space

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:28.090
S. The expected value of
R1 plus R2 plus Rk is just

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.465
the sum of the expected values.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.212
And the proof of that is by
induction using that result.

01:10:40.212 --> 01:10:41.920
And the really important
thing about this

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.430
is that neither of these
results needs independence.

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:52.764
It is true whether or not
the Ri are independent.

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:01.190
Pretty much everything
we do in probability

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:04.530
to manipulate random variables
needs them to be independent.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.050
You don't need that here.

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.412
And that'll make
it very powerful.

01:11:08.412 --> 01:11:09.370
So let's do an example.

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:32.446
Say I roll two fair dice.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.720
Six sided dice.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.360
Not necessarily independent.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.730
R1 is the outcome
on the first die.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:12:00.740
And R2 will be the
outcome on the second one.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.680
And I'm interested in
the sum of the dice.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.470
So with that R
it'd be R1 plus R2.

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:12.062
And I want to know the expected
value of the sum of the dice

01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:12.770
when I roll them.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.260
Now, if I didn't
use that theorem

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.740
I'd compute the tree
in the sample space.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.360
I'd get 36 possible outcomes,
take the probability of each.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.210
It'd take you a
little while to do it,

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:33.320
but using linearity of
expectation, it's easy.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.070
It's expected value of R1
plus the expected value of R2.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:43.230
Each of these we already
figured out is 3 and 1/2.

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:46.330
And so the answer is 7.

01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:49.170
So if you roll a pair
of dice, whether or not

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:52.721
they are independent, the
expected sum is seven.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:59.270
Any questions about
linearity of expectation?

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:00.122
Yeah.

01:13:00.122 --> 01:13:01.038
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.550
PROFESSOR: This one?

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:11.334
[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:11.334 --> 01:13:12.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:16.530
PROFESSOR: No, I
mean pluses here.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.230
Here?

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.413
I'm computing the sum
of the random variables.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.180
So this could be a 1, that could
be a 10, this could be a 3.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.610
So I'm compute the
expected value of the sum,

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.770
just like when I
rolled two, dice I'm

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:36.328
taking the expected value
of the sum of the dice.

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:37.161
Any other questions?

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:47.610
Now we're going to do a
little trickier problem that

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.562
uses linearity of expectation.

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.970
Yeah?

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:57.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sets, like when

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.845
we're looking at the failure.

01:14:01.845 --> 01:14:06.208
Couldn't we add the two
cases, like R1 being

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.650
a girl and R2 being a boy?

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:14.924
PROFESSOR: Well, what
would it mean to sum-- so

01:14:14.924 --> 01:14:16.090
what is the random variable?

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.820
R1 is the case
when you get a boy.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.940
So it's an indicator
for getting a boy.

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.790
R2 is the indicator
for getting a girl.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:25.310
R1 plus R2 is by
definition 1 then,

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:26.760
because you got a boy or a girl.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.330
One of them had to happen.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.920
And the expected
value would be one,

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.690
But that's a different
kind of game.

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:36.440
But we are going to start using
this in sophisticated ways

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.305
to make calculations be
easier for things like that.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.180
so

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.230
This problem we call
the hat check problem.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.250
And the idea here
behind this is say

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:59.350
that you have n men at a
restaurant having dinner.

01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.110
And when they come
into the restaurant,

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:04.360
they check their hats
in the coat room.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.790
Then something goes
wrong in the coat room

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:10.200
and the hats are all
scrambled up randomly.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.010
Let's say a random
permutation of the hats.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:15.480
So the men come back
to get their hats

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.370
and they get a random
hat coming back.

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:31.220
So each man gets a random
hat back after dinner.

01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:35.520
And the question is, what is
the expected number of men

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.331
to get the right hat back?

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.840
So we let R be the
random variable

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.590
that says the
number of men to get

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:49.162
the right hat, their happen.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.140
And we want to know the
expected value of R.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.850
Now, from the
definition, that's just

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.570
the sum of all possibilities.

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.556
K from 1 to n.

01:16:04.556 --> 01:16:09.100
K times the
probability R equals k.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.330
So using one of
the definitions, we

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.310
could compute the
expected value this way.

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:17.820
In fact, if you were to
be assigned this on a test

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.770
or on homework, that's
probably how you'd

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.010
start something like that.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.994
And then, well, the
next step you'd take

01:16:25.994 --> 01:16:28.410
would be to figure out what's
the probability that exactly

01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:32.980
K men get the right hat back.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.280
In fact, we actually
asked this once before we

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.430
started doing it in class.

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:40.170
And it was really hard if
you went down this path.

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:44.230
Because if you spent all
night with your buddies,

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.780
you would maybe get
to the conclusion

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:52.330
that probability R
equals K is this.

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:59.800
1 over K factorial times n minus
K down here for K less than

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.680
or equal to n minus 2.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:10.130
And 1 over n factorial if
K equals n minus 1 or n.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:14.590
Then you would plug that nasty
looking thing into there.

01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:18.330
So multiply by K. And
you'd have to sum it up.

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:19.780
And Lord help you.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.000
That's just a nightmare to do.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.640
You'd have a very hard
time getting the answer.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.980
If you doubt that, try it.

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.964
But that would be a
natural way to proceed.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.430
But it turns out there is a
trivial way to get the answer.

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.940
And this is a very
powerful technique

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.200
using linearity of expectation.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.590
And for sure there will be a
problem on the final exam just

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:45.790
like this.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:49.620
And so if you go down this path,
which is a natural first path,

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:53.630
it may take you the rest
of the day to solve it.

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:55.130
But the method I'm
going to show you

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:57.407
will take you a couple
minutes to do it.

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.070
Now, the trick is to use
linearity of expectations.

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:09.610
So the problem is
there's no sum here.

01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:11.960
So what we need to do is
we're going to express R

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.300
as the sum of random variables.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:22.740
And the way we're going
to do that is as follows.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.540
And it's not obvious,
but once you see it,

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.094
it's easy to keep using it.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:35.825
We let R be the sum
of R1 plus R2 plus Rn.

01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:40.075
And Ri is going to
tell us the event.

01:18:40.075 --> 01:18:42.570
This is sort of what
you were talking

01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:45.170
about before with the event
of a boy or event of a girl.

01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:47.580
This is going to be the
event of the ith man

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.830
gets his right hat back.

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:52.710
So it's an indicator
random variable.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:59.610
It's 1 if the ith man
gets the right hat.

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.110
And it's 0 if he doesn't.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.700
So whenever the ith guy gets his
hat back, that counts as one,

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.095
and now you can see
why this sum works.

01:19:17.095 --> 01:19:21.110
R is the number of men to
get the right hat back.

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:24.210
And it basically there's a
one counted in here every time

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:28.740
a guy gets his hat back,
and 0 if he doesn't.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:33.276
So this sum is counting how many
men got their right hat back.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.980
Non-obvious the first
time, gets really simple

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.420
the fourth or fifth time.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.896
We'll try to do a
couple of them today.

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:52.505
All right, now the expected
value of R is easy.

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:57.270
It's just by linearity
of expectation,

01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:00.590
expected value of
R1 and so forth

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:01.890
plus the expected value of Rn.

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:10.150
The expected value of an
indicator random variable

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:13.350
is just the probability
that it's 1.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.040
Right it's 1 times
the probability,

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.484
it's 0 times the
probability of 0.

01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:19.150
That's just the
probability that it's 1.

01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:31.680
What's the probability that the
first man gets the right hat

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.400
back?

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.080
1 over n.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:35.730
There's n hats.

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:38.820
He gets a random one.

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.607
What's the probability that the
second man gets his hat back?

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:47.980
Not 1 over n minus 1.

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.760
He's coming in whether he's
first, second, or last.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.630
He gets a random hat.

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:55.310
1 in n chance it's his.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:04.660
What's the probability the last
man gets the right hat back?

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.200
One over n.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.033
Doesn't really matter
if he's first or last.

01:21:07.033 --> 01:21:09.030
Just sort of tricks
up a little bit.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.480
He's getting a random hat back.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.470
So it's 1 over n.

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:17.880
I got n of each, 1
over n, so what's

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.170
the expected number of men
to get the right hat back?

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:23.290
One.

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:26.680
Now, the math doesn't get
much easier than that.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.480
Now, the amazing
thing is we just

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.730
proved that if we take
that mess, stick it in here

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:38.610
and sum it up, what
answer do we get?

01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:39.900
1.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.310
That is certainly not obvious,
but that is a consequence

01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:44.240
of everything we've just done.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.560
We've just given a probability
proof of that fact.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.170
But the nice thing here
is there's actually

01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:52.920
even more powerful.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.870
Did I need to assume that it
was a random permutation of hats

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.600
like I would need
to assume for this?

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.040
No independence is needed.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.350
In fact, there's all sorts
of distributions that will

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:11.140
give the same expected value.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.220
All I need is that each
person gets the right hat back

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.246
with probability 1 over n.

01:22:17.246 --> 01:22:19.960
In fact, this is an example
of a different distribution

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.390
for which the
result is the same.

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:24.459
Say you're at a
Chinese restaurant.

01:22:24.459 --> 01:22:26.250
And you know they have
the thing that spins

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.640
in the middle of the table?

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.380
Say that you each
order an appetizer.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.850
There's n people and they're
around a big circular table.

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:35.110
Everybody gets their appetizer.

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:36.930
Wonton soup, whatever.

01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:40.540
And then there's always the
joker who spins the thing

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.560
and spins around
and then it stops

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.480
and now you've got a random
appetizer in front of you.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.930
In this case, we
want to know what's

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.920
the expected number of people
to get the right appetizer back.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.460
Not the other guys
wonton soup, but yours.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.120
That's a different
probability space

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.362
because there's only n
sample points, n places where

01:23:02.362 --> 01:23:03.570
the thing could have stopped.

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:08.390
Not n factorial like the hats.

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:12.670
Well, does the analysis change?

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.660
Exactly the same.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.320
Ri is the indicator
variable for the ith person

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.200
gets the right appetizer back.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.650
Linearity of expectation.

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:24.580
The expected value of
the indicator variable

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.750
is just the probability
that it's 1.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:28.210
And the probability
that any person

01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:31.010
gets the right
appetizer is 1 over n.

01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:32.150
So the answer is the same.

01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:34.483
The expected number of people
to get the right appetizer

01:23:34.483 --> 01:23:36.400
back is 1.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.130
So totally different
probability spaces, exactly

01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:43.840
the same analysis and answer.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.260
OK, so we'll do more
of this next time.

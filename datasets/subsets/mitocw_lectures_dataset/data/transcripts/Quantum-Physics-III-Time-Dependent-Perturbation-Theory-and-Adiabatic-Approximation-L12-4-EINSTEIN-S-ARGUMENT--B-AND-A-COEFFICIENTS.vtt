WEBVTT

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.840
PROFESSOR: OK, so
that's our equation.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.400
Three terms-- first term,
spontaneous emission,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.290
second term, stimulated
emission proportional to Nb,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.430
third term increases
Nb's absorption.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.130
Our strategy now is, so
what do you do with this?

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.540
This looks like a good
equation, but what are we to do?

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.950
We haven't used three, really.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.720
So we can solve for U. And
this time, the equation

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.150
won't want to make U equal 0.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.190
It will give us something.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.780
And then we can compare with
a thermal equilibrium relation

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.760
to get something.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.000
So that's our goal.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.270
So how do we solve for U?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.780
Let's divide by Nb.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.030
So divide by Nb.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.970
So a 0 here, pass this to
that side, and divide by Nb.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.815
So you get A on the
left-hand side equals--

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740
let's see, should I put the--

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.770
well, minus Bba Nb.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.200
Actually, I'll do it like this--

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.610
the second term first.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:41.700
Bab Na over Nb times U--

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.430
so I'll put it here,
a U of omega Ba--

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.620
minus Bba.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.380
OK, so I moved the first term
to the left-hand side, grouped

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.580
the U. Why did I group the U?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.610
Because I said,
let's find what U

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.080
is, and try to compare with
other things that we have.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:20.080
So now we can solve for
the U. U of omega ba

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.490
is equal to A divided
by this quantity.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.220
So it's A divided
by a big thing.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.590
Let me factor out the Bab.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:50.860
So now we have here Na
over Nb minus Bba over Bab,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:03.670
or A over Bab 1 over
Na over Nb is there,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.550
is e to the beta
h bar omega ba--

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.910
It's a minus sign with
respect to number 2--

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.185
minus Bba over Bab.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.540
OK, this is great.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.015
We're in very good shape.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:40.200
In fact, we're here.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.700
Let's compare with
our thermal radiation.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.920
So here is what we got.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.150
And we have to compare
with fact number

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.200
three, which is the thermal
radiation formula, which

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:11.870
is h bar over pi squared C
cubed omega cubed 1 over e

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.530
to the beta h omega.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.240
And I'm comparing with
the thermal radiation,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.520
U of omega ab.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.550
I canceled the D omegas, because
this is U without the D omegas.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.830
So omega ba minus 1.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.370
All right.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.730
It's perfectly nice and ready.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.120
We need to compare this
formula with this one.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.670
They have to be equal.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.560
Well, this factor, must be
equal to this factor, given

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.580
that here you have e to
the beta h bar omega ba.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.350
These are constants.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.450
And the first thing that you
discover is Bba equal Bab.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.880
And so yes, very nice.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.520
This is what we learn
in perturbation theory.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.170
These two processes
have identical rates.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.780
So the first statement
that this equality requires

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:30.100
is that Bab is equal to Bba.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.210
So there's just
one B coefficient,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.810
just like there's
one A coefficient.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:47.530
And the second thing that
you learn is that A over Bab

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.415
is this ratio--

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.845
is h bar omega ba cubed
over pi squared C cubed.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.380
So we will be able to
calculate the B coefficients,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.770
because they represent
the familiar properties

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.470
of harmonic perturbations
transitions,

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.020
and we've done already.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.620
Calculating A is
harder, in principle.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.070
The process of spontaneous
emission is a harder process.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.710
But this relation says that we
don't have to worry about it.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.355
We already, if we know B,
these are constants, we know A.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:38.780
So many times, even in
problems in the homework,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.980
you will be asked, what is
the spontaneous transition

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.170
rate for this decay?

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.580
You have an oscillator.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.080
It's in an excited state.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.680
What is the rate of
spontaneous transition?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.720
And then you say, OK,
this is complicated.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.830
But you calculate the
stimulated transition rate,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.230
and then plug in
this coefficient.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.480
So it will not be difficult.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:12.060
Now, spontaneous emission, as
we discussed there in the top,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.310
doesn't include
the factor having

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.750
to do with the density of
photons, the U that tells you

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.220
how many photons there are.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.730
Because the photons
play no deep role

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.610
in producing the transition.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.190
But at some level,
this transition--

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.820
while it's not stimulated by
the photons that are flying

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.110
around--

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:44.600
when you calculate it, in a
serious, detailed calculation,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.960
you can think of
them as stimulated

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.410
by the vacuum fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.670
So if you were to quantize
the electromagnetic field,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.030
there are vacuum fluctuations.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.750
And those vacuum
fluctuations, you could say,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:09.420
they are stimulating what we
call "spontaneous emission."

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.570
So at the end of the day,
the electromagnetic field

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.520
is a quantum field.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.260
And therefore, it has zero
point energies, Casimir effects,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.120
vacuum fluctuations.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.870
You can't get away from it.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:29.400
So in some sense, everything
is stimulated emission,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.370
stimulated by a lot of
photons or stimulated

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.260
by the vacuum fields.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.789
Anyway, we'll still
remain with the name

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:44.610
"spontaneous emission," and
keep those things very distinct.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.610
These rates have
different effects

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.520
at different
temperatures, as well.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.900
So we'll consider
that, for example,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:05.460
in that at low temperatures, the
black body radiation has a very

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.360
little number of photons.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.590
So most of the
transitions, if they occur,

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.130
are happening due to
spontaneous transitions.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.020
On the other hand, as you
increase the temperature,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.630
the number of photons that
are available per unit volume

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.320
increases, and stimulated
emission takes over.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.870
So these are the different
contributions to the rates.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.700
And it gives you a perspective--
at very low temperature,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.590
spontaneous dominates.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:43.130
At very high temperatures,
stimulated emission dominates.

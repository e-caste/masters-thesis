00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.116
GUOLONG: That is Friday in one
of the classrooms of Building

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:19.512
26, 11:00 AM.

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:21.470
MARZIEH: So I was quite nervous.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.311
SHAWN: The first day is a
little bit nervous for me.

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:25.810
CARLA: I was nervous.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.899
I'm not going to deny it.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.940
NARRATOR: Facing your
students for the first time

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.870
can be a little
scary, but it's also

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.220
an opportunity to establish
that your class will

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.890
be user-friendly.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.580
BILLY: I think the
first day of class

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.170
really sets the tone for
the rest of the semester.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.390
NARRATOR: How can you
set the right tone?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.380
As they make their way to your
classroom on the first day,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.956
what qualities are your
students hoping for?

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:52.330
BILLY: Being knowledgeable
and understanding the concept.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.000
ADRIAN: And you need to feel
that you can approach them.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.750
CHANDLER: Have just
an air of confidence.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.820
ADRIAN: Being easy
to understand.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.311
BILLY: And being enthusiastic.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.019
CHANDLER: Being there,
having a presence,

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.330
having a lesson plan ready.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.780
CAROL: They're well-organized.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.520
NARRATOR: That may
sound like a lot.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.440
Let's start with
approachability.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.840
ADRIAN: That is important that
you feel accepted and welcomed

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.942
in the environment.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.400
NARRATOR: Being
approachable can be

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.920
as simple as facing the class
and smiling-- even if you feel

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200
like hiding behind your papers.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.590
And making eye contact.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.760
BILLY: Making eye contact
just is a personal connection

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.479
to the person you are talking
to-- the audience in general.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.710
So students feel like the
explanation you are making

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.432
is for them.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:39.390
CAROL: It is an important
form of communication

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.300
for them to do that.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.360
It definitely holds the
students' attention.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.984
BILLY: In terms of
international TAs, in general,

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.400
there may be some
misunderstanding

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.020
here and there, but I think
it's important to make

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.270
the students comfortable
asking for the TA

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300
to repeat any word
or any sentence.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.840
CAROL: I think at the
beginning of the semester,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.080
they should maybe say that
it's OK for the students

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.639
to ask for clarifications
if something isn't clear.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.460
I think that's generally
a good thing for all TAs

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.040
to welcome any questions.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.010
ADRIAN: Show that
you are open and you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.550
care about the success
of the students

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.360
that you are trying to teach.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.930
NARRATOR: Enthusiasm
is another way

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.074
to show your students your
class will be friendly.

00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:33.490
BILLY: Being enthusiastic and
showing that you're actually

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.865
passionate about
the material you

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:39.730
are teaching-- that also gives
a little more comfortable

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.180
atmosphere during recitation.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.560
CAROL: I think TAs who are
excited about what they're

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.930
teaching-- or if
what they're teaching

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.440
is very specific
to their research--

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.976
you can tell that
they want to teach it

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:53.850
and they want you to
learn it because they're

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.840
very excited about it.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.290
Then the student is probably
going to be more engaged.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.970
NARRATOR: And before
any other quality,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.220
students say they
want knowledge,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.746
but they're also
confident you'll have it.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.120
CAROL: I think I
personally trust

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.840
that MIT has selected fine
TAs to teach us the material.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.420
NARRATOR: So on the
first day, rather

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.410
than trying to
impress the students,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.940
stick with the simple
explanation of why you are

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.930
a good fit to teach the class.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.140
GUOLONG: I'm a third year grad
student in the department of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.360
I'm working with Professor
Oppenheim, who is also

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.700
the lecturer of this class.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.075
NARRATOR: Students also want
TAs to show self confidence.

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:37.824
CAROL: When I think
of confidence in a TA,

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.800
I think of someone who is
very-- they come off as, OK, I

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.650
know this material
better than you,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.090
and I'm going to
teach it to you.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.040
So often, I think TAs who speak
not super fast and just pretty

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.430
articulate and slower, so
that their point gets across,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.027
usually I feel more
sure that they're pretty

00:03:57.027 --> 00:03:58.110
good at explaining things.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.950
BILLY: The speed you have when
you talk in a conversation,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.555
just divide that by two.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:04.680
And just because you're
nervous in front of people,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.470
the speed will
increase either way.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.120
So, speaking a little
bit more slowly

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.170
helps a lot because you
can also have the time

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.700
to think about
what you're saying,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.300
and the audience and the
students you're speaking to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.519
will have a better time
understanding, especially

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.870
if pronunciation or if
you have a certain accent.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.700
NARRATOR: So, speed
makes a difference

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.840
in how students see you.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.830
What about volume?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.220
SHAWN: In a big
classroom, I definitely

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.960
have to remind myself
that I have to raise

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.830
my voice a little bit louder.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.820
NARRATOR: Speaking
too quietly can also

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.659
give the impression
of nervousness.

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.430
GUOLONG: This week's
lecture focuses

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.490
on sampling rate conversion.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.780
NARRATOR: A stronger
voice projects confidence

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.070
and commands attention.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.850
GUOLONG: This week's
lecture focuses

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.014
on sampling rate conversion.

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:56.680
NARRATOR: Getting to
the classroom early

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.070
can also help you to feel
more confident, because you

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.260
can get to know the students
before you start teaching.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.110
And planning ahead
not only makes

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.640
you feel more
confident, it also makes

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.280
students confident in you.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.860
CAROL: So, I think
one TA that I had--

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.380
when I think of a user friendly
class, I think of his class,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.560
because every day he had
his recitation planned

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.480
to the minute-- which
is pretty ridiculous--

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.612
but it actually was very
logical in a way that

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:29.695
helped the students learn.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:34.740
So he would pretty much write
the agenda on the blackboard.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.666
Like from minute
zero to minute five,

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:37.790
we're going to take a quiz.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.240
And from minute
five to minute 10,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.950
we're going to talk
about the quiz.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.421
If they seem like
they're well organized--

00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:47.040
they have their papers in
a nice, little folder--

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.342
I definitely look at that.

00:05:48.342 --> 00:05:49.800
CHANDLER: Having
a real lesson plan

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.716
and showing that there's
going to productivity

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:53.280
in the recitations is important.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.980
Having someone prepared
shows that they

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.560
were thinking about us
when we weren't in class.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.220
NARRATOR: Finally, international
teaching assistants

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.600
also stress preparation
and planning

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.840
in their advice for a
successful first day.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.080
SHAWN: As an international
teaching assistant,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.620
we have some
disadvantages probably

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.840
compared to native speakers.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.500
But if we are prepared,
if we show our enthusiasm

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.800
towards the subject,
I think the students

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.045
will feel them as well.

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:24.670
CARLA: Just be prepared.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.992
That's what speaks scores about
you-- if you're very prepared.

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:31.644
MARZIEH: I went through all
the notes, all the books that

00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:33.450
are related to the course.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.940
And I tried to prepare
some good examples.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.982
GUOLONG: I think for that
class, I did over preparation

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:47.825
that if I discussed
everything on my notebook,

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:50.310
it would take two hours
instead of one hour.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.570
So I think never
running out of materials

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.889
seems another source
of my confidence.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.180
CARLA: I should be
confident enough just

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.080
by the sake of being the TA.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.430
You shouldn't be nervous
because you do know more

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.110
about the topic than they do.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.246
MARZIEH: It was challenging,
but in a good way.

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:13.520
SHAWN: Get everything prepared.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.720
Do your best.

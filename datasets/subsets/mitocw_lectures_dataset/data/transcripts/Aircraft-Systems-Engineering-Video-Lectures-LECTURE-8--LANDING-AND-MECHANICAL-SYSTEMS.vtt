00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.569
Allen Louviere started life as an airplane
designer, went to Lamar University in Texas

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.579
and then worked at General Dynamics in Fort
Worth.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.289
You told me about the YB-57.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.289
I don't know what other planes you worked
on up there, but -- Oh, B-58s, B-36s, F16s,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.580
F111s and B-57Fs.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.100
Then they wanted to send him all around the
world and had a young family.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860
And that was about the time that Johnson Space
Center, which at that time was called the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.370
Manned Space Flight Center, was getting started
in Houston in 1962.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.840
So, Allen came to work.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.539
And his specialty is mechanical systems.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.109
We had a little discussion last night about
some of the things that he has designed, but

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.160
for me one of the most amazing is the landing
gear on the Lunar Module.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.160
I mean when you think that you can actually
design the first piece of the hardware that

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.009
touches down on another planet that's pretty
exciting.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.880
And, like most of the people who have been
lecturing, he went onto work in similar systems

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.450
for the Shuttle.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.289
So, he also worked on the landing gear.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.450
You can see a piece of tire here.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.360
We'll talk about that landing gear, payload
bay doors, and robotic arms.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.320
And so he's going to share with us some of
the experiences, both from the subsystem design

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.810
point of view and then from the bigger systems
engineering picture.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.229
So, Allen, it is all yours.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.479
Thank you.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.250
The Lunar landing was sort of interesting.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.350
The big problem was we didn't know what the
lunar surface was like so you didn't know

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.030
how to size the pad, which is always interesting.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.780
The landing gear, we are going to talk about
today, was much easier and it will do.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.750
We're just going to talk about just mechanical
systems.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.230
It's not as romantic or ingratiating, but
you've got to have them.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.359
So, some of the avionics and other systems
that you will see.

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.579
Actually, I should say one thing.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.540
From the point of view of space engineering
in general.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.510
When you're building satellites or other space
systems, the one thing that you try to avoid

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.889
at all costs, I think this is far to say,
is any mechanisms.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:45.859
Because you send a mechanism into space and
they fail.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.199
They get too cold, they get too hot, they
get vacuum welded.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.370
Now, sometimes when you have people on a mission
they can fix it.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.560
I mean if you remember Apollo 16, the Lunar
Rover, one of the fenders broke off.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.419
And so they actually had to make another fender
out of their checklist so that the dust didn't

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.560
get all over them.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.870
But basically that is the fear that all mechanical
designers live in is that you're designing

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.880
these things to work in an incredible environment.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.440
And I'm sure you will talk about the landing
gear.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.690
That is one thing.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.650
We know how to build landing gear for airplanes,
but how do you keep them alive for two weeks

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.630
in space in a rather unfriendly environment?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.570
Well, the professor is right.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.010
The problem you have is when you get these
mechanical systems, if you have a lot of linkages,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.850
you're afraid they're going to weld themselves
together.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.970
And we've never had that happen but it certainly
could.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.728
The division I was in had all of these pieces.

00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:47.130
The landing gear.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.340
We had all the doors on Orbiter.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.228
I think there were 25 or 35 doors on Orbiter
that had to have mechanisms that had to open

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:56.000
and close.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.160
We built the repair tools.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.359
We had a set of tools for these fellows to
us.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.220
And if that payload door didn't close that
was really a bad day.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.220
We put some tools onboard, a little wrench
and a lot of cutting tools, and you will see

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.630
some of that.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.899
The manipulator, these are pretty well things
that had been done before.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.680
We had never done one of these before.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.660
That's a whole different animal.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.290
The separation system was for the separation
system for the external tank.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.790
There were three big separation systems.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.630
It was not only a mechanical system but it
was a pyro-system, it was an explosive-type

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.880
system.
Believe or not, we had the ejection seats
on about the first four or five flights.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.790
We used the SR-71 Blackbird seats.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.310
And we never had to use them, thank goodness.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.250
We also had the docking system.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.460
We had the Apollo system.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.600
We had the Apollo-Soyuz.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.020
And, if you look at the Orbiter, it is very
close to Apollo-Soyuz with a little bit of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.600
modification to it.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.820
That's the whole system.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.460
But, fear not, we're not going to talk about
all of those because that's just too many

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.220
to talk about.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.110
We're going to talk about two.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.630
We're going to talk about the landing gear,
wheels, brakes and tires.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.440
And we've been building these for a long time.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.380
It's more empirical design than I ever realized
when we got into it.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.880
We had never built a manipulator before.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.880
And we started this as a technology study,
and it ended up being the main cargo handling

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.280
piece on the Orbiter.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.630
Also, we did a lot of coordination and integration.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.700
All mechanical systems depend a lot on other
people.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:56.630
He tells me that he wants to emphasize systems
engineering, and I would like to second that

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.060
because it's very important that you know
that.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.070
When you look at the systems engineering -- By
the way, you don't have to be silent.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.360
If you want to speak, now is the time.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.360
I'm just here for a day.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.360
I'm going to talk about this.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.620
All engineers love the design part.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.750
I did.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.060
I found out that there was a little more to
it than I first suspected.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.630
If you look at requirements, schedules, cost
and weight, most of the engineering work you

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.450
think would be here in the requirements.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.490
Once they are set, sometimes they're very
difficult to change.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.630
On Orbiter they were very difficult to change.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.100
And we may have gotten some requirements that
maybe we could have done a little better with

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.070
had we changed them early.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.760
And you will see the results of that, particularly
on the landing gear.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.120
That is probably the number one thing that
we worry about at Johnson.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.870
We like to keep these guys where they come
back.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.870
Now, these pieces right here are really engineering
sort of things.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.110
They relate to physics and maybe even Newtonian
mechanics.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.150
These don't.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.060
Those are really estimates that somebody makes
early.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.240
And what they end being is a refinement process.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.480
Most of these equations these fellows use
from here are really empirically developed

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.290
over many years.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.050
They say here is the way this goes.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.230
But all of these end up being estimates.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.180
You think you're going to work there, but
these three right here, schedule, cost and

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.110
particularly for us in the aerospace weight
turns out to be a big, big driver.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:56.110
In fact, it will tell you what you're going
to have to do in many cases.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.590
Well, we're going to talk a lot about that.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.680
We'll talk a little bit about test.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.639
I presume you all, in your labs, do a little
testing of some sort.

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.639
But we do a lot.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.050
We do development testing early on.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.949
For the manipulator, we did a little bit more
than that.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:20.570
We do qualification testing which is I'm going
to go test this thing and see if it meets

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.330
all the specifications that somebody has designed
for it or the requirements.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.949
And last but not least, after all of that
is done, you do what is called a verification

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:31.699
and certification test.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:34.799
And it should be ready for flight.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:39.309
I don't know what industries you're going
to work on, but even in avionics, if all of

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.820
your avionics people, there's a mechanical
guy.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:51.500
Even in avionics you'll have some sort of
validation and certification test.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.490
And these will drive you, too.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.020
After all this is done, we did a flight test
program.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.589
And the initial test that came back from there
made us do some changes on this.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:09.110
And then you always get this.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.020
Engineers are never satisfied with just making
it good.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.810
Better is what they want.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.790
And program managers, where is Aaron?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.540
He is not here today so I don't have to worry
about him.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.310
Program managers don't like that because what
happens is this goes up and this goes up and

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.750
that slows down, and that's not what they
want to do so we have to go back and do that.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.920
Enough of the intro.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.710
These were essentially the first requirements
that I could conjure up after all these years.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.940
You've got to remember, this was 30 years
ago.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.940
Some of these may be a little off but they
are about right.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.150
It was going to be a freefall gear.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:01.490
We're just going to get it started, open the
doors and let the aerodynamics and just the

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.750
weight of it drop that gear down and lock
it in place.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.750
The gear extension time was nominally ten
seconds.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.690
That was the max that we ever wanted it.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.080
It would probably go down at about six or
seven.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.990
And we normally said the landing velocity,
we don't want to drop that gear.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.020
Once the gear is down, we don't want to go
more than 225 knots.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.380
Remember, this is in the early `70s and we're
still trying to figure out what we're going

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:31.630
to do.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.810
But you've got to have some requirements to
start with and these were the ones you started

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.850
with.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:37.649
We had a runway.

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:40.680
And we said the runway is going to be 12,500
feet.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:47.680
We would like 15,000 feet, but because of
the flight that the Orbiter took there were

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:54.460
landing sites all over the world so we had
to be sure that we'd get the landing sites

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.620
with the 12,500 feet at least.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.460
Cross-winds.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:06.370
When you're coming in for a landing, if you
have a cross-wind, 15 knots was about it.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.760
We'll chat a little bit about that.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.690
The deceleration, that was just for the brakes.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.500
We had three hydraulic sources that we could
use.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.250
There were some auxiliary power units in the
back that powered up the hydraulic system,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.899
and we had about three sources.

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:29.190
Most air craft just have two and a pneumonic
system.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.480
We did not have a pneumatic system.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.020
But that worked very well, by the way.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.290
The steering is nose gear steering.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:43.649
And the hand controllers you could steer the
front nose gear.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:46.120
And it would go plus or minus nine degrees.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.480
The turnover angle, if you just took two wheels
and turned it over, the max that you could

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.550
ever get out of that was about 63 degrees.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.640
This set of requirements is about what we
started with.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:04.640
And, not to stop you, here are some more.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.360
These turn out to be really pretty critical.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:17.360
We will call them critical conditions that
the Orbiter has to meet.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.300
And this is landing weights.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.000
And that is just how fast you're coming in
when you hit the runway.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
At 214,000 pounds, we were going to say we
can take a sink rate of 9.6 feet per second,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.490
which is pretty fast.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.290
And this is nominal.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.050
If you go to Orbit and you come back and you
make a nominal landing.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.089
If it's 230,000 pounds, it's about six feet
per second.

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:49.580
I came in yesterday on an 880.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:56.580
I asked the pilot what he landed at, and it
was 130 knots.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.240
And I think the weight of that thing is about
150,000 to 170,000 pounds.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.830
We're coming in with no engines so we're coming
in pretty fast to be able to do that and set

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.339
down.

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:14.709
This is an abort condition.

00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:19.209
If we're on a mission and the controller is
calling abort, you take off, turn around and

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:22.630
come back and come back to the Cape.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.160
In that case, we have a payload onboard so
the weight is going to be a little heavier.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.209
Now, the pilot has to be a little better here
because he's got to have a little lower sink

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:35.820
rate because we don't want to take all that
load in the gear.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:41.000
In fact, the transatlantic landing, when was
working, there were only two sites.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
One was at Dakar across the Atlantic and the
other was at Rota, Spain.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:58.430
I think Newfoundland now is one for the high
inclination ones.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.800
And AOA was once around.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.769
You'd go up to orbit and you'd come right
back down the next time around so you'd get

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:07.000
back to the Cape.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.730
That was essentially what we had.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:17.730
This particular one was a driver also because,
in the early days, the Air Force wanted to

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:23.980
have a mission like this where you'd go up
once, you deploy a satellite and you come

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.740
back around.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.459
And they were only one single orbit and you'd
come back around.

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:33.290
Now, getting those payload bay doors open
and getting the satellite out was, to say

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.120
the least, an interesting design problem to
do that.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.250
You don't have a lot of time.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.800
Anyway, these were the other drivers that
you had to do.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.560
These were the ones that really drive you
because they'll tell you what the loads are

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.430
in the system.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:58.430
And this just tells you that all NASA guys
have these acronyms.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:06.180
This is a set of circumstances that says we
want fail operational, fail operation, fail

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:07.910
safe.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:13.910
So, if it fails first you can still operate
it, if it fails again at least you're fail

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.490
safe and you at least preserve the crew.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.870
We usually use fail op, fail op, fail safe.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.980
In this case, in the landing gear, we only
had two.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.779
But we had a whole lot of ways to get this
gear down.

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.140
And I'll show you.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:36.140
It's kind of complicated to take a look at
but if you release the gear it starts to fall

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.990
just by gravity, but then we have a little
hydraulic assist and then we have a pyro backup.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.610
Whether you want that pyro to fire or not,
it's going to fire every time you drop the

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.490
gear.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.970
So when the gear comes out, it comes out backwards.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.459
And the airflow is this way which drops the
gear down and locks it into place.

00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:58.829
That gear is not a light gear.

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:00.209
I mean it's pretty heavy.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.430
You're talking about 400 or 500 pounds coming
down.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.600
And that's just the nose.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.790
The main gears are larger.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.800
And then the mains operate about the same
way.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.560
And I'll show you where all this stuff is.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.370
I have a little drawing here that will get
you going.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:23.320
The professor and I talked a little bit about
design.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.290
Yes.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:32.620
You only drop the landing gear a few seconds
before landing.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.860
If one fails you still have time to do all
the others?

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.399
I'm sorry?

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.480
You only drop the landing gear a few seconds
before touchdown.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:40.730
Yeah.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.950
If one method fails, did you still have enough
time to try one of the others?

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.920
We decided that all three of these were going
to be in play every time.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.079
We made sure that we got that gear down.

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:55.899
That's truly a bad day if that gear is not
down.

00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:01.240
All you do from the cockpit is just put down
the gear handle, and then everything works

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.920
at once.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.450
Everything works at once.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:08.019
You don't have to decide has the gear gone
down and, if not, do something else.

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:11.769
It just all works.

00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:18.638
I think you'll find that we tend, at Johnson
Space Center, to overdesign on the side of

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:19.569
safety.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.230
And it really didn't matter to us anyway.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:29.230
We really want that gear to go down and lock
in place, and that's what this is all about.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:35.590
The other things that we worried about, and
probably where the requirements on this particular

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:42.090
vehicle were the weakest, we said we could
turn this thing around in 30 to 60 days at

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.039
the Cape after every flight.

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:48.559
Well, that really didn't work out that way.

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:53.539
When you have that many systems onboard and
there is so much to take a look at after you've

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:58.399
gone to a flight, just the post flight operations
is a long time.

00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:00.519
And I'm not sure we ever made 30 days ever.

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:05.440
We may have made 60 once, I think, but I'm
not sure.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.619
And the other thing was the pad stay time.

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:14.289
First flight, as I recall, was on the pad
for about four to six months.

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:18.809
And now you've got to make all your systems
work.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:21.320
It's like having shelf-life on this thing.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.999
You've got to make this thing work.

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:25.629
It's got to function.

00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:30.100
That was the other one and that was a big
problem for us, particularly from tires.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.840
They leak.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.840
You sure don't want to have those tires leaking
in about four to six months.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.029
We had no landing propulsion system.

00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:49.480
Once those guys came in, it was all energy
management from an altitude all the way.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.289
And the landing velocities were rather high,
the weights were rather high.

00:18:55.289 --> 00:18:56.039
Probably some of you fly.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:56.379
Let's see.

00:18:56.379 --> 00:19:01.879
A 737 weighs about, I'd say, 160,000 to 170,000
pounds.

00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:08.489
And they come in just right at about a maximum
of 175 miles an hour, but we're coming in

00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:14.169
with no engines at about 200.

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:20.859
The runway touchdown point, I've got a little
drawing of a runway and I'll show you what

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:24.600
that is, that turned out to be a real key
issue.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.169
When we started out that 12,500 feet I showed
you was actually 10,000.

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:36.320
And after a while we decided without engines
and then without reverse thrusters we really

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:36.999
couldn't do that.

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:43.070
While that not only affected the Cape design
but it affected where in the world we could

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:47.359
land this thing, I think Guam was the other
place.

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:50.409
We could go to Anderson Air Force Base on
Guam, right?

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:52.739
Yeah.

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:59.739
And here is what frightens all mechanical
engineers, limited testing, where we're only

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:01.480
going to have about three or four flights.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.019
We were going to have five.

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:05.309
It worked so well that they decided to go
with four.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:11.509
And everybody gritted their teeth on that
one because we really wanted one more flight.

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:18.509
These are some more requirements of sorts,
but these were outside requirements that you

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.009
have to take what you get.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:24.889
And so, when you do design work or whatever
field you're going to work in, you're going

00:20:24.889 --> 00:20:28.320
to find you're not always your own boss on
this.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.489
You have to go with what you've got.

00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:33.269
And I think that's part of the system of engineering.

00:20:33.269 --> 00:20:39.220
We were told that the idea of moving the Orbiter
with the 747 wasn't brought up immediately

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:46.220
and that it was going to tried to be move
with like strap-on engines.

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:52.909
So this part about no end-flight retraction
[OVERLAPPING VOICES]?

00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:59.899
The first design of the Orbiter, actually,
the early designs had jet engines, but the

00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:01.940
weight -- Remember we talked about the weight
earlier?

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.479
The weight just drove that out.

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:05.289
We couldn't do that.

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:10.179
Plus, when you reentered with those engines,
you've got another problem with all the heating.

00:21:10.179 --> 00:21:16.609
And you probably have the fuel that you have
to worry about so you've got a lot of problems.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:17.989
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:24.879
Would that have been a real big problem [UNINTELLIGIBLE
PHRASE]?

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:27.919
Yeah, it would cost you money and weight.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.409
Remember those two things I told you up there?

00:21:29.409 --> 00:21:30.879
It would cost you money and weight.

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:34.769
Remember now, Congress is a finicky bunch.

00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:38.049
You don't go back to them unless you really
have to, to get the money.

00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:40.899
If Aaron is here, he could probably give you
a lecture on that.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:47.899
He used to lecture me on that, as a matter
of fact.

00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:53.499
The Carrier Aircraft or ferry, one of the
guys in our division, a gentleman who just

00:21:53.499 --> 00:22:00.080
passed away recently, named John Kyker had
been a B-24 pilot.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.850
Actually, he and another fellow named Owen
Morris built a little model of the 747 and

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.970
a model of the Orbiter.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.649
And they actually flew it.

00:22:11.649 --> 00:22:15.090
The wingspan was about like that.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.710
And they actually flew it to see if it would
be all right to put that Orbiter on top of

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.249
that model.

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:24.200
And, by golly, surprise, it worked like a
charm.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:31.200
Also, when they flew that model, they found
that they had, on entry, a different setting

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:36.149
on their elevon than what was being projected.

00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:42.989
And, low and behold, they went back and they
found, yes, they did and they changed it.

00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:46.460
We don't have any in-flight retraction for
what you were talking about.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.269
We would get the gear stored on the pad and
ready to go.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:55.450
And, as I said, we want to be sure it comes
down when we tell it to come down.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:02.450
Actually, in the hanger the Orbiter is up
on jacks.

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:08.940
And one of the last things they do before
they wheel in a carrier mechanism that will

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.399
take the Orbiter out over to the vehicle assembly
building, you have to push the gear up manually.

00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:20.210
And, actually, the final stage because it
has to actually go in and lock inside the

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.729
locking mechanism, someone is up there basically
with a big pole and just push it up until

00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:29.149
you get it to click into place.

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.840
And that's terrible.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.090
There is no hydraulic system to reconnect
it.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.259
Well, we get a little bit of hydraulic help
but it's not enough.

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:37.769
You have to get manual labor.

00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:42.659
But it's all because of the weight and cost
that we were talking about.

00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:45.840
And weight was really one of the big issues.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.859
When you go to work, you're going to find
out that all of those empirical things, not

00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:54.389
the design problems, not the Newtonian physics,
is what really gets you.

00:23:54.389 --> 00:24:01.389
Did they have any sort of like emergency barricades
at landing sites if a tire went?

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.529
Yes, they did.

00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:08.859
At Dakar we put up a net at the end of it.

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:13.440
And I think Dakar was one of the shorter runways.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.340
I think we were worried that when we came
in at Dakar with the kind of peddles we were

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.470
carrying that the Orbiter was going to be
very heavy.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.599
It would be this 256,000 pound thing.

00:24:22.599 --> 00:24:25.119
And that's a big thing with no engines.

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:28.059
And we'll talk about the brakes here a little
bit.

00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:33.419
The brakes were not really qualified for a
short stop on a heavy vehicle.

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:38.349
Remember, in the early days we had no drag
shoot?

00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:39.149
No drag shoot.

00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:40.849
Well, we're going to talk about that, too.

00:24:40.849 --> 00:24:46.379
I'm going to try to talk about all this stuff
until you guys go to sleep or something.

00:24:46.379 --> 00:24:47.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:52.450
Well, enough of that.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:52.989
One last thing.

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:56.690
You will see that I'm worrying you to death
on requirements.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:02.149
Whether you like it or not, when you go into
engineering you're going to find that if you

00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:05.029
get the requirements right you'll probably
get the design right.

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:09.340
If they are not right you're going to have
lots of trouble.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.859
We didn't get them all right.

00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:17.859
We didn't get them all right but it was good
engineering work.

00:25:19.289 --> 00:25:25.669
The tire pressure, we had to start somewhere
so we said here is what we're going to do.

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:29.259
We're going to do some sizing on these tires.

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:36.259
And, on the landing gear, we did this before
we even had a contractor, our first pressure

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:40.259
was about 340.

00:25:40.259 --> 00:25:44.509
I think the tires on your car are around 35
psi or something like that, if you're lucky

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:47.489
on a good day and they're not leaking.

00:25:47.489 --> 00:25:50.809
And the upgrade now is about 380.

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:55.179
I think they want to go to 410.

00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:56.029
The wheel is aluminum.

00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:57.519
The axel is aluminum.

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:59.299
We've actually bent the axel before.

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:00.549
We've landed that thing.

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:03.580
The first axel we had, we bent the axel.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.080
It deflected a little bit and took the brakes
out.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.049
That was another one of those things so we
had to up that.

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:12.899
It was sealed with two O rings.

00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:14.149
That was a good one.

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:15.279
That was good to start with.

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:19.960
The initial design, as a matter of fact, was
great because that four months we had to stay

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:26.960
on the pad for the first flight we got no
leakage, which was good.

00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:31.989
The initial brake pads were beryllium.

00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:36.830
Now, beryllium has one great feature that
everybody liked.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.119
The Langley Research Center had been working
on brakes and they were using beryllium.

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:45.419
Goodrich had been working with the beryllium.

00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:51.549
And it turns out that it has a great heat
transfer capability, and we thought that was

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:53.080
really going to be good.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.429
And what do you say in your jargon?

00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:56.849
Wrong.

00:26:56.849 --> 00:26:59.070
It was wrong.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.649
It did not work out right.

00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:05.139
We had four rotors to start with.

00:27:05.139 --> 00:27:05.989
We have five now.

00:27:05.989 --> 00:27:12.989
If you're going to look at your brakes, I've
got a picture up here, just like the front

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.220
wheel brakes on your car, they have a caliper
and you just put a pad on it.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.970
But we have more pads than you do.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.429
You will see some more about this.

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:27.239
This really got us.

00:27:27.239 --> 00:27:31.099
A negative angle of attack, if you ever looked
at the Orbiter when it was sitting on the

00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:33.219
runway, it sits nose down.

00:27:33.219 --> 00:27:38.639
And when you come in and you drop that nose
down it's going to load up that main gear.

00:27:38.639 --> 00:27:45.369
And you will see what that does.

00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:49.340
That might be all of the requirements that
I have to start with.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:56.340
Here is what the wheel looks like.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:28:04.479
This particular drawing or graph is really
what we started with.

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:08.059
And these are the summary things that we began
with.

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:12.159
And this is the nose gear.

00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:16.070
There are probably two or three things over
here that are really important that we had

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.580
to worry about.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.619
One was a static load and the other was the
weight for this thing.

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:23.169
This is all aluminum.

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:26.929
And we didn't want those going up.

00:28:26.929 --> 00:28:33.809
At the time, inflation pressure for the nose
was 300.

00:28:33.809 --> 00:28:36.679
I think it's still a little more than that.

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:43.679
But the rest of this is just spec sort of
things.

00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:46.710
Now, when we did this, we had to start with
something.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.359
We did not have all this data.

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:56.359
What we did is we had a chart similar to this,
in conjunction with Rockwell, and we worked

00:28:57.499 --> 00:28:58.869
back and forth.

00:28:58.869 --> 00:29:00.729
That's another one of the interfaces that
you had.

00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:02.710
You always have a contractor.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:09.710
And, of course, Rockwell had several contractors,
I think, ten or twelve on this gear.

00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:14.039
Getting this particular chart straight was
very, very important to us.

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:21.039
Maybe some of the features, there is the inflation
valve, the diameter here is about, I think

00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:29.840
this one was about 32 inches, 34.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.840
And one of the design problems you get is
how big a tire can I put in the wing or how

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.879
big a tire can I put in the nose?

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:43.200
Now, the Orbiter wing is pretty good.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.080
It's kind of deep.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.080
The nose is not that roomy, but the nose gear
is a smaller wheel.

00:29:55.539 --> 00:30:02.539
It doesn't take the load.

00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:09.700
That is low right now.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.129
I think that's a little higher.

00:30:11.129 --> 00:30:16.940
Here is the tire that goes with that.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.279
The same sort of thing.

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:27.279
We start out with a sheet similar to this,
not this neat and not this accurate, but now

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:32.080
you'll notice that the tire weight is about
50 pounds.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:38.210
Now we're about 100 pounds of tire just for
one wheel and tire on the nose gear.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.109
And there are two so now we're at 200 pounds.

00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:46.729
I will tell you for sure, program managers
will ask you what those weights are.

00:30:46.729 --> 00:30:48.539
If Aaron were here he'd be fussing.

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:50.919
He'd say, yeah, you let that get away from
you.

00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:54.479
But that was the other one.

00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:59.590
This is not terribly dramatic.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:06.590
But I think the other thing is, see this thing,
the design tire life was just for two landings.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:12.239
I'm not sure we've ever done two landings
on a nose gear.

00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:15.249
I think after every flight we will take them
off.

00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:22.249
And, because of the way the runway is built,
I will show you a little bit about the runway.

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:28.149
Here is a tire.

00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:32.359
This is ALT-1 which is approach and landing
test one.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:32.669
If you can lift it.

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:34.299
I am going to pass it around for you.

00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:37.769
This is ALT-1.

00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:42.019
Here you will see that we've got 20 plies
which is all this stuff here.

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:43.320
And that is what we used.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.249
I think it is 28 now.

00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:53.249
And you will see that at the top here is real
rubber which is great, but synthetic rubber

00:31:54.929 --> 00:31:55.489
is better.

00:31:55.489 --> 00:31:59.639
The tire we have now is synthetic rubber and
is much better than what we have.

00:31:59.639 --> 00:32:01.549
And you will see we have these beads in here.

00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:08.549
Now, when you go back to the other piece here,
we've got to realize that
if you've ever tried to change a tire and

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.629
you put the tire, all of you have bicycles.

00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:24.559
Everybody in this town has got a bicycle,
I think.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:25.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.200
Even him.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.899
Anyway, when you try to change a tire, you
can put one side in.

00:32:30.899 --> 00:32:33.440
But getting this on would be really tough.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.999
See, if you try to change this tire out it
would be pretty hard.

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:43.479
You have to split the wheel so you can get
that thing, and you put it in and then you

00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:47.749
put the wheel around the tire instead of putting
the tire around the wheel.

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:50.719
And, when you see this thing, you will understand
why.

00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:53.049
I will pass this around for you and you can
take a look.

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:55.169
It is heavy.

00:32:55.169 --> 00:32:58.039
And those beads are really interesting.

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:00.849
They mean business.

00:33:00.849 --> 00:33:01.389
They are tough.

00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:08.389
They are steel.

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:14.419
Here is a nose gear.

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:16.169
This is STS-95.

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:18.460
Where you on 95?

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.580
Oh, I've got yours in here.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.789
I've got yours.

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:28.789
Well, I'm going to let you tell it.

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.279
This hit pretty hard.

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:39.309
And if you take a look, you can barely see
it right there, but a chunk of rubber came

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:39.729
off.

00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:42.469
And it's that good rubber that I was telling
you about.

00:33:42.469 --> 00:33:44.580
It's the natural rubber.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.179
The ones we have now are better.

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:53.179
And when these tires hit, I think this particular
one, they dropped the nose gear on rotation

00:33:54.859 --> 00:33:55.440
early.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:02.320
And I think, when they did, they hit the tough
part of the concrete at the Cape.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.359
And you just get rubber everywhere.

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:09.520
Smoke and rubber and all kinds of stuff.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.159
I think these are 32 or 34.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.399
These are things that you really have to go
and handle with care.

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:20.290
They are big.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.630
You'll note there are no brakes on these front
tires.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.730
We will get that in a little bit.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:32.730
Just to comment.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:41.210
Last time we talked a little bit about what
goes on when you actually land, but what Allen

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:48.210
was saying is you flare out and then the pilot
has to stay on the rear gear and hold the

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.918
nose up for just the right amount of time.

00:34:53.918 --> 00:34:59.640
If you hold it up for too long then you're
going to lose the lift.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.490
And, in the end, the nose gear is going to
fall down too fast and you run the risk of

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.640
busting your nose tire.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.370
On the other hand, when you come down because
of the negative angle, you actually, as Allen

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:20.040
said, when you get down below horizontal,
now you're putting more weight on the rear

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.510
wheels.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:26.060
And so, if you come down too early, now you
run the risk of blowing your rear tires.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.030
And so it's really a critical maneuver.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:35.030
You have to hold it up just the right amount
of time and then bring it down real slowly.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.050
I think Lousma was a Marine, wasn't he?

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.120
Yeah.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.500
Astronaut Lousma came in.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.700
We didn't like him to fly too much because
I think he did carrier landings or something.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.280
I'm not sure what the guy did.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:56.410
He'd come in and drop that gear down pretty
hard and we'd all cringe thinking those tires

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:01.110
were going to go.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.140
Now, we saw the nose gear.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:09.000
This is a repeat performance, except now we've
got to make this wheel so we can put the brakes

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.970
on it.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.630
We've got to put the wheels on.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.320
And now the same thing.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.350
Now I'm going to tell you a little bit about
integration with other people.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:27.810
In the landing gear world, we were at the
mercy of the structure's people.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.830
You really wanted to be friends with them
because they told you what the loads were.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.410
And coordination with those people was really
critical.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.120
And I'm sure you're going to find that.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:46.120
If you're in any kind of construction whatsoever,
all the structures folks, you want to get

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.330
them early on.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.790
And the other people you want in there early
are the operations people.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.510
Those two people are the ones you want very,
very early.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:58.540
Here is the right load now.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:04.220
If you just multiply that by four, you'd get
about 250,000 pounds, 270,000 pounds that

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.220
we could take.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.200
And that is about what you're going to get
on that back gear.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.310
When you come down, you will get a little
less than that.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:16.760
We have about 20% to 30% margin empirically
designed.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.580
And we tested it at Wright-Patterson.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.690
We tested this wheel.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.860
This is a single O ring wheel.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.630
The O ring is about right there.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:34.450
And we tested this at Wright-Patterson with
a side load on it, like on the flight he was

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.400
on.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:41.890
And I had to tell Aaron Cohen that every piece
of the wheel came apart, which is not what

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:46.410
you want to do with the program manager, but
we had to start over.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.330
So, we did.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:53.060
And we beefed up the wheel, we beefed up the
bolts.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:59.630
We found that the two O rings we liked because
they were good for leakage, but we also found

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:05.060
that when you put them on that the wheel failed
because of the O rings.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:11.820
Also they failed because we were putting the
wrong lubricant on those bolts, and that took

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.280
a while.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.200
And that particular failure, I just talked
to you about, had both those problems.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.360
How did the lubricant cause the wheel to come
apart?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.500
They couldn't get the right torque on the
bolts.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:31.350
I think they put too much torque on the bolts.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:37.530
We never really found out, but we changed
lubricants and that went away.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.560
I told you now this is not Newtonian physics
we're talking about here.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.010
We're talking about empirical design.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.730
And you had to go test this stuff.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.780
And we did.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.090
Let's see, what was the other point?

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.610
Here is where the axel fits in here.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:39:00.610
I will show you where the brakes go here in
just a minute.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:08.010
I don't have a main gear tire cut like that
one, but it's much larger.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.370
It's about 40.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:14.400
I think this one was 42 inches.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.330
They tell me that they want to go to 44 inches
for a little bigger wheel.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:27.330
In the beginning, again, weight and cost stopped
us from going any farther than that.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.890
Mainly weight in that case.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:37.570
Again, this was the critical wheel that we
had to work with the structures people.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.900
Our structures group worked it and Rockwell
structures group worked it, so we had two

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.520
structures groups that were working together
and we had to wait until they gave us a load.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:52.310
But when you have a design you cannot really
wait until all the loads are in.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:59.310
You have to start with something, so we started
with a design that we thought was conservative.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.440
It was not.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.560
But we started with one that we thought was
conservative and it did not do it.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:11.560
You can see that the max load was 142,000
pounds per wheel which gave us a nice margin.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.910
Of course, those are the aft wheels, the main
gear.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.230
And we liked that margin on there.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:25.230
And the inflation pressure is about 370 on
that.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.320
This thing is like a stick of dynamite.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.820
If it blows you have really got some problems.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.680
I mean you have shrapnel everywhere.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.560
But when you do the test it is always behind
the cage or something where you can do it.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.760
Again, safety was our problem.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:49.760
When I saw that last orbiter come in, I thought
for sure that something had happened to the

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.780
wheel well and that the explosion was in the
wheel well.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.120
It terrified me.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.320
Partially it was not the wheels that went.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:08.320
They went eventually, but if you blow four
of those wheels, two on each side, that's

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.530
not a good day at all.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.120
The Orbiter is about the same size as a 737.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:22.120
Everybody flies a Boeing 737 about the same
size, but they land a little softer and not

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.480
quite as heavy.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.870
But the geometry, a planned form looks about
the same.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:35.310
They don't have the payload bay that we have,
but it is pretty close.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.840
And here are the big guys.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.070
Now you will see the hydraulic systems.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.940
There are all the hydraulic systems that go
in there.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.770
And trying to move one of those tires by yourself
is a chore.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.550
It will get you in shape.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:55.080
Rolling that thing around at the Cape will
get you in shape.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.650
And it's the same thing.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:59.320
It's a split wheel that we have.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.960
This one has the same problem.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.240
You cannot see it but it is right there.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.060
There is a big piece gone from right there.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.500
And, again, it's the runway.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:16.500
If you hit the runway on the high coarseness
this is what you get.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.150
I'm going to show you the runway here in just
a minute, or a little sketch of it and you'll

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:29.850
be able to see it, but you can see that that
is a fairly big strut.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.650
And we needed it.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:37.800
How much travel does the strut have?

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.360
You mean after it's down and locked?

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.140
Oh, I would say probably six inches to a foot,
just depending on which ones that Rockwell

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.500
picked.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.890
I'm not sure which one they have now.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.690
We had a pretty stiff strut to start with.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:54.250
I think they've done a little work on that.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.420
That's a good question, by the way.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:02.420
That does affect it a whole lot because you
don't want to drop that gear too low because

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.580
those doors are open.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:10.520
If you drop that gear too low and that strut
goes up, you're going to get those doors,

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.090
and there goes that turnaround time we were
talking about.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.910
There goes the turnaround time.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:22.910
I've got another one of my goodies here.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:27.560
This is not the beryllium.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.910
The beryllium had one big problem.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:37.130
We thought that the heat transfer was great
but the homogeneity of the heating was not

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.700
good.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.370
You would get spots.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.350
Once you did that it would warp the brake.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:46.490
When it warped the break then it would do
all sorts of bad things.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:53.490
When you look at this, here are the stators
and here are the rotors.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.480
This was a stator.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.190
And what this is is they had two sets of stators
on each of these.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.030
And then, of course, the rotor went all the
way around.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.330
But here is a brake.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.970
And you will see that it's only a piece of
a brake.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.560
And you are going to find out it is very,
very heavy.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:21.560
And there is really not much I could tell
you about these, except that the one good

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:29.910
thing we did was we insisted that Rockwell
leave enough room in here for five stators

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.200
and rotors.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.550
We started with four and right now we have
five.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:42.550
And so we did it partially right anyway to
start with.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.670
Here is the axel, and this will fit on all
of these.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:55.670
And we thought we did about 25 stops with
this thing, but I think we probably end up

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.760
somewhere between four and ten.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.200
Again, that's just money.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.820
And, again, that's the turnaround time we
were talking about.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:08.900
So, all of the things we thought we could
do, systems engineering things, did not work

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.630
out quite right.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:16.630
So the stators had to pass?

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.890
Yeah.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.310
The caliber just pushes against it?

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.430
Just pushes, yeah.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.870
It just shoves it.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:32.030
There is the caliber so you just close that
thing up and you just squeeze those guys together

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.720
and you watch the smoke come out.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:40.720
Did the caliber float at all like on a modern
one?

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:48.430
We found that we had to do an orphus hydraulic
system.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:55.760
We found out the problem you're talking about,
they had a funny name for it, but it was the

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.560
one you're getting at.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:02.620
And what was happening is that the brake was
cycling because it was not orphused.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.990
Once we orphused that thing it worked very,
very smooth.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:11.150
And, just like your front wheels, it just
doesn't look much different than your front

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.810
wheels, except they are a lot bigger.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.060
And how would you like to have that pad on
your car?

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:23.060
You would never have to have them replaced.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.200
Here you go.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.330
This is a mechanical engineers' dream.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.320
Here are more linkages than you could ever
want.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:42.300
You can have all sorts of fun with this kind
of linkage.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.700
This is the forward part of the Orbiter.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.580
The nose comes around kind of like that.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.580
And you can see that we've got that gear stuffed
in there pretty good.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:55.860
And some of the things that are on the door
are sliced out, so when you look at the door

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.770
in there you have just a whole lot of things
in there.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:04.660
And what happens is, remember I said the first
thing is we have a little hydraulic actuator

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.630
that starts this thing?

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.550
And, whether you want to or not, it opens
those doors.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.820
And we will fire this bungee right here.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.330
This is a pyrotechnic thing.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.890
And no matter what, we are going to fire that
thing to be sure that if the hydraulic system

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.930
isn't going to that, we are going to drop
that thing with a pyro.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.300
So, it opens the doors.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:28.340
Once it opens and you start that gear down,
remember, you've got about 200 something knots

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.010
of wind that is going to drop.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.770
So, this is going to help you.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:38.220
It comes down, it folds down that way.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:43.920
Our only comment to Rockwell was that we didn't
like all this.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.920
The leakages were even more than that when
we started, and we had to reduce those down.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.140
There is a little fitting right up here that
you can get a little bit of help to get the

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:03.620
thing back up.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:10.620
But you do need the guys with their polls
shoving it back up.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.860
There is the wheel.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:29.420
And once it's down, there is no brake on that
one.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.650
This is the forward one.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:34.310
This will give you a little better idea.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:37.660
This doesn't look too much different.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.690
Forward is this way.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.570
If you go that way, you see the gear has come
down and is now locked into place.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:50.570
In the other picture you couldn't see these
little yokes, but when the strut comes up

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:58.450
those yokes come up and grab it.

00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.230
There is the extender strut.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:05.290
Essentially, the drag shut, it's a solid piece.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:11.050
I'm not sure what you could say other than
the fact that that right there is the booster

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.380
actuator that I was talking about, the pyro
actuator.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.950
And it is going to fire every time no matter
what.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:22.950
The same thing for the mains, except they
are bigger.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:32.920
One problem we had with this particular one
was these doors.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.630
Those are big doors.

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:37.560
They are bigger than probably two of these
tables.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.300
Maybe like that and wider so they are big.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.200
And the problem is sealing them.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.320
When you're coming in and you're going to
re-enter, you've got to get a seal on there

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.860
that is going to work.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.750
Most of these were bolt seals.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.650
You just put the Freon and they squeezed closed.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.010
There is no seal sticking out.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:01.300
Of course, it has got the re-entry material
on it.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:07.620
But, again, these were part of our problem.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:13.870
And those seals were probably the trickiest
things that we had.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:20.870
And here professor is at extend/retract actuator,
but it still won't do it all.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:26.480
You could hook up a hydraulic system to get
this gear back up.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.550
Forward is that way.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:35.930
But you need a lot of help.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:36.730
Again, it was a weight problem.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:43.730
I am going to show you this one, but
I had to go to the Space Center Houston because
I couldn't get a picture of the Orbiter.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:02.660
So, this is a little mockup.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.130
And here is the gear.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.400
And what I really want to show you is, see
that little guy right there, that's the pyro

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.970
system that kicked that thing out.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:11.880
They call it a bungee.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:17.340
It's a Rockwell term, but it's not like a
bungee.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.790
It's really actually like a pyro.

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:26.220
And when that strut comes back up here are
those yokes I was telling you about.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.030
It just clamps around that strut and it hold
it up.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:36.030
That's probably the only thing you can see
that is worthwhile on this picture.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:44.390
Now we're going to talk a little bit about
integration, an interesting problem.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.640
Rockwell was our prime integrator.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.460
They integrated everything.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:52:00.460
We helped them, but they had all these people
as contractors.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.430
Not only did Rockwell have to deal with us.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.090
Rockwell had to deal with all these contractors
that they had.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.980
The wheels were made by BF Goodrich.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:15.360
Not Goodyear, Goodrich, which is now Michelin,
I think.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:21.690
And they flew it on the F-14 and C-5a which
is a pretty big airplane.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:28.340
We didn't have a four-wheel truck like the
big aircraft did like a 747.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:32.670
We thought that would be a great idea, but
we didn't have the room in there to put the

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.080
whole thing in.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.340
The brakes were BF Goodrich, the same ones.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.460
They were the ones that really wanted to go
with a beryllium.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:48.450
It turned out that they passed all of the
initial tests for the beryllium, but the beryllium

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:52.070
had no life, so we never really had a test
failure.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:57.930
But we had a test of things we really didn't
like the way it was going so we changed.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:03.940
They changed, I think, in 1990 or 1985 to
the carbon brake that I was showing you just

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.740
a minute ago.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:12.140
The nose gear steering is a bi-steeror.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:18.950
Nose gear steering is after you land and you
get the nose gear down you can steer.

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:25.630
It turns out that the astronauts did not like
to use the nose gear steering, so what they

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.860
would do is get on the brakes.

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.290
They would do the brakes like this.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.810
And they'd steer that way.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:36.580
When you do that you heat those brakes up
pretty good.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.190
You heat the brakes up.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:43.500
And, besides that, there was a single point
failure in that nose gear steering.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.240
If that thing failed, and it failed in a bad
position, it might be nine degrees off, and

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.480
so you're going to run the Orbiter off there.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.260
I had to agree with the astronauts that probably
the right thing to do was just get on those

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.210
brakes and steer with those guys.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.500
Menasco, they built struts for almost everybody.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:05.210
HydroAir, they had all kinds of actuators.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:10.470
And Rockwell did all the bar linkages that
I was showing you about.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:17.470
The antiskid system was another one of those
important things.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.060
What is it on your cars these days?

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.810
The ABS system.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.620
This is our ABS system right here.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.140
And we had one.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.970
And we had nose gear steering.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.130
We had all that good stuff.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:37.070
You've got to remember now this is 30 years
ago so it's a little different.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.320
There we go.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.700
I had to put that in there.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:40.510
I like this picture.

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:46.040
There is nothing technical about it but I
like it.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.700
Isn't that neat?

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.230
Look at those little skinny wheels on that
big vehicle.

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:54.650
Isn't that something?

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:55.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.020
It looks like somebody made a mistake.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.400
Anyway, it's coming in there.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.119
You will note there are no drag shoots.

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:06.930
The initial design actually had a drag shoot.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:13.810
One of the guys in our division decided that
we didn't need a drag shoot so he put in an

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:17.360
improvement which reduced the cost.

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.430
That was a mistake again, so we took the drag
shoot off.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.560
And I eventually had to put it back on anyway.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.090
All engineers are not exactly right, but this
thing flew well.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.560
The gears really worked out real well.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.560
We were tickled pink whenever we would see
that thing fly.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.040
I may have already told you.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.210
I had to put that in there.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:45.210
I like that picture.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:48.750
This was a dilemma.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:53.430
The tires never really failed to the spec
that we gave them.

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.930
We didn't like it because we didn't think
we would get the life that we wanted out of

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:57.750
it.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:02.300
And so we had running discussions.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:08.950
Maybe not battles, but certainly running discussions
with Goodrich on that tire.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:15.950
We got excessive testing tire damage with
a dynamometer test where you do all the testing

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.150
and we put the side loads on.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.340
And we just didn't like what was happening.

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.340
Even though it passed this we went to, say,
20% over.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:30.800
We were really getting failures that we really
didn't like.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.240
And we knew, from the very beginning after
the test, that we were not going to get the

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.250
five or six landings that we thought with
every tire set.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.490
On the mains you'd get one landing and that's
it.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.970
And you can see why you would get these big
hunks.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:52.020
I think they are better with the new runway
or with the way they fix the runway.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.930
I talked about the wheel.

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.500
The wheel cracked.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.050
We had a wheel crack with a load.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.990
The bolt lubricant did not work.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.720
We couldn't get the right torque.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:10.210
The two O rings caused a failure in the split
wheel.

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.030
The bolts broke and we failed the 1,000 mile
test.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.140
That doesn't sound great, does it?

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.090
But it really was because this was an empirical
design.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:24.850
It worked fine because it met the spec that
we had.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:31.200
And what drives you, as engineers you might
not like it, but program managers have their

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.030
problems, too.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:35.640
They have costs they have to worry about,
they've got schedules they have got to worry

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.720
about, and they get you to do things that
will work every time.

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.670
And then later on you can make the improvements.

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:49.610
The beryllium brakes, we had cracked hot spots
on the pad, we had thermal expansion and some

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:54.590
melting.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:58.510
Goodrich kept telling us that those cracks
did not matter for flight, but we didn't like

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.660
it and we fussed with them a lot.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.540
And we fussed with Rockwell a lot.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:08.440
And after maybe ten years they finally changed
them.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.869
The entry displacement was lower than expected.

00:58:10.869 --> 00:58:17.869
We thought sure that the beryllium would be
a great way to do it, and it didn't work out.

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:23.760
And I talked to you a little bit about the
hydraulic system causing that wobble.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.369
That was the test results on our outline.

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:33.170
Let's talk a little bit about the runway.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.840
I have more goodies for you.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.820
The runway was about 15,000 feet at the Cape.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:47.820
Before the flight test, how do you actual
simulate flight conditions, especially with

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.670
the wings to simulate heat dissipation?

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:54.930
You mean dropping the gear?

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.400
Yeah.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.000
I don't think we ever really did.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.410
I don't think we ever had a wind load on it.

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:02.040
But we tested that gear.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:08.460
One time we did it with a lower pressure just
to see if the hydraulic pressure would work.

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:12.060
And that may give us a little bit of something,
but that's all we ever did.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.570
We had high confidence in that pyro.

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:16.570
If you ever heard it go off.

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:23.570
But you rely on the wing load to dissipate
the heat, right?

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.790
One of the things, yeah.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:26.660
And gravity, of course.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.330
You're getting a gravity down, too, on the
thing.

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:32.470
So, you're getting wind, you're getting gravity,
you're getting pyro, you're getting hydraulic.

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.990
No, to dissipate the heat in the brakes.

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:41.110
Not the gear, but to dissipate the heat from
the brakes you rely on the wing load.

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:41.540
Oh, sure.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.340
But you couldn't test that on the ground?

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.280
I don't think we ever put it in a wind tunnel
or anything.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:52.130
If we did, I don't remember.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.500
But we did check a lot to see what the heating
was.

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:59.060
And we did it on a dynamometer which is like
you do to your car tires.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.310
No, I don't think we ever did.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.170
That's a good question.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.740
I wonder why we didn't do that.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.570
I had to think about that one.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.700
Here is the runway.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.010
A lot of people in NASA have built runways
and looked at them.

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:16.900
And what they did is they put these grooves
in there to get the water off, just like they

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.740
do on the highways now.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:25.740
And you will see that is the grooved runways
right there.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.600
It sits in there about like that.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.390
And I will pass this around and let you see
it.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:37.680
And you will see that it is really rough.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.680
And you can see hitting that surface at those
speeds is not really good.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:51.950
What they have done, after I left by the way,
which is a great thing to do, is they shortened

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:57.970
the high friction part of the runway and they
pinned it with like a ball pinned hammer.

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.660
They pinned it like they do highways.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.940
That got our friction factor down.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.200
We missed the friction factor, by the way.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.980
And they put a thing called a corduroy on
the front.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.880
And here is the corduroy.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.740
You want to take a look at that.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.200
It's like that.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.530
And so now the runway looks like this.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:22.310
I think if we were going to fly the Orbiter
some more that probably with this runway now

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:26.840
at the Cape we would probably get a little
better use out of the tires.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.540
It turns out that trying to determine the
friction factor here was not as easy as we

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:32.850
thought.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:38.000
And you will see when you see that the thing
is not a smooth surface.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.890
It's a pitted surface and it has little things
that stick up.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:48.890
And so if you pin it down like you do like
a highway and get that it's much better.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.860
We've gone through the requirements.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.740
We've gone through some of the testing.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.220
Now let's talk about operational findings
that we found on this thing.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:08.050
Remember, if you're going to be an engineer,
which you are I hope, you're going to find

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:11.280
out that all three of these things will be
a problem for you.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.270
You'll have to look at the requirements, you
will have to look at the testing, and you

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.200
will have to look at the operations of the
thing.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.430
If you work for a company they will put you
way ahead if you tell them we ought to go

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:25.310
find out how this thing is operating with
our customers.

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:27.680
Here is what we found.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:34.490
Our deployment velocity, when we dropped the
gear on landing, was 312 knots operational.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.920
Good.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.740
We were right on.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.020
Landing velocity was 225.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.410
We actually came in once at 232 or a little
higher than that.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.690
And that was the Marine landing.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:50.690
I'm not quite sure he was wanting to do those
carrier landings.

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:52.380
The operational weight was higher.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.020
We designed for 214 to 230.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.490
We ended up with about 225 to 232 which is
not bad because we had enough margin in those

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:04.109
tires and wheels to take it.

01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:07.450
The sink rates were not bad.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:11.160
6.7 is about what they would always land at,
which was really pretty good.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.140
Now you can see that our design was not that
far off.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.430
The negative angle of attack I want to talk
about here.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:22.150
Let me show you it.

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:29.150
For some reason the initial design, which
I guess we were all part of, had a negative

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.030
angle of attack if you would take this route.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:37.230
It was about four degrees down like that.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:41.869
Now, if you take a look at this, when you
come in here you will see that if you're going

01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:46.859
to get a load in your landing, so the elevons
are going to be up a little bit, what you're

01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:50.990
going to do is all those loads are going to
dump right straight into that back gear.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.970
And that's really not what you want.

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:56.420
You ask yourself, well, why don't you just
raise this gear?

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.990
And the answer is money [LAUGHTER]

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.300
and weight.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.650
But the initial thought was we ought to have
it to look like that and do that and we will

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:08.880
take the load off the brakes.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.440
I'm not sure that was one of our better moves
but that wasn't bad.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:21.440
We talked a little bit about this [the negative
angle of attack?].

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:25.670
The nose gear steering was never really used.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:27.310
I'm not sure they do it now.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.510
Oh, no, they fixed it.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:30.230
Have they fixed it?

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.170
Yeah, they use it.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.840
In fact, it was after our flight.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.720
That is when they finally decided to fix it.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.100
We're going to talk about his flight in just
a minute here.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:44.810
I went through great lengths to get his.

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:50.020
We had one tire failure on 51D.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:56.250
And, after our operations, we did find that
we could get John Young, who was chief astronaut

01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:02.500
at the time, to say, yes, we're going to change
how we do these elevons on landing so we will

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.350
take some of the load off that gear.

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:05.690
Let's review it.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:11.160
We had the requirements, we had the design,
we had the test results and now we've got

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.109
the operational results.

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:18.040
The whole systems engineering scheme is to
go from start to finish.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.470
And this is what we did.

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:24.359
I may have made this sound more negative than
it was.

01:05:24.359 --> 01:05:27.730
It was great fun and it worked really well.

01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.850
I mean it worked well.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:37.619
As an example, and what the professor was
talking about a minute ago, we did one of

01:05:37.619 --> 01:05:37.869
these.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:42.859
This is loads here, but we did one for heating
early on.

01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:48.050
And we had a little computer, which was one
of the few on the center at the time.

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:49.830
It was a Wang desktop.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:53.230
They've never seen that.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:54.420
I know that.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.480
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.470
It's a foreign word.

01:05:56.470 --> 01:06:00.320
It's about this big.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.980
And I think it had a max of about 256k and
that was it.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:13.980
We, to keep up with Rockwell, instead of loads,
did heating because we were more worried about

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.490
the brakes than we were the tires.

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:21.980
And, if you look at this curve, this one sets
that nose gear down a little early.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.760
You come in on the mains and you drop that
nose gear down.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.279
And then all of a sudden you get this spike.

01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:33.350
Well, you can imagine if you get this spike
here, the heating is going to be higher from

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.500
there on.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.080
If you keep that nose up, like he was talking
about a minute ago, and you just wait a while

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.730
and you get way down the runway or down the
runway some place, you get a little lower

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.350
load and it's a little easier on those tires
and on the brakes.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:53.060
It gives you a little longer rollout, but
that's not bad because we've got plenty of

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.710
room.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:58.220
Now, some of these fellows had a problem with
this one.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.410
This is 51D.

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:04.900
This is the infamous flight for the professor.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.859
See that tire right there?

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:09.730
It is blown.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:15.859
It is the only tire that we blew in the whole
of the flight test.

01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:20.359
And what are we at 210 or 214 along flights,
and it is the only tire.

01:07:20.359 --> 01:07:22.500
I'm sorry, 114.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.160
It's the only tire that we blew.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.440
And I tried to ask him last night what they
did.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.160
I'll tell the story.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.910
Well, I was going to tell you, he had a tremendous
side load.

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:35.750
He had a tremendous 15 knot crosswind that
they got.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.029
And the gentleman who was flying was a fellow
named Bobko.

01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:41.810
He's kind of fun to talk to.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:45.220
He did a good job getting that thing in.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.880
And they got pretty far down the runway.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.619
I think it was only 200 feet, our guys told
me, before that tire blew.

01:07:50.619 --> 01:07:51.950
And you were almost at a stop.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:52.930
You were just going a little slow.

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:59.930
But the brakes were heating up because he
was on those brakes fighting that side load.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.369
More operational findings.

01:08:11.369 --> 01:08:14.820
We shot-blasted the center strip at the runway.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:21.670
We improved the groves, like I was showing
you, and we put the corduroy in.

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:25.908
And that all happened after I was there, but
I still deal with the guys out in the center

01:08:25.908 --> 01:08:27.649
and they helped me out to get this.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:34.649
The design problem was the wing volume that
we had.

01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:36.868
We started 42.

01:08:36.868 --> 01:08:38.670
They tell me they are going to go to 44.

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.929
I don't know if they have.

01:08:39.929 --> 01:08:41.948
The tire pressure was 370.

01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:43.190
We could go to 410.

01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:47.679
I think the new tire will have 410.

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:54.068
We talked a little bit about lengthening the
nose gear which would relieve some of that

01:08:54.068 --> 01:08:55.979
problem with the nose down.

01:08:55.979 --> 01:09:01.130
It turned out the proposal was prepared.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.948
It was presented.

01:09:01.948 --> 01:09:06.488
And they decided that they really didn't want
to do it because it would cost too much money

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:07.639
and was too much weight.

01:09:07.639 --> 01:09:13.609
The Orbiter, at one time, had a CG problem.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:18.109
And I don't think they wanted to weight up
there with that much of a moment arm on it,

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:20.509
was one of the reasons.

01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:22.179
The carbon brakes were added in 1990.

01:09:22.179 --> 01:09:23.769
They worked great.

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:29.318
The new synthetic tire in 1992, which is different
from that tire right there, worked very, very

01:09:29.318 --> 01:09:29.839
well.

01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:30.899
The drag shoot.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:35.859
We put the drag shoot back on.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:40.238
And this is nothing more but a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:43.719
picture, but there is that drag shoot right
there.

01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:46.149
We have that drag shoot on now.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.389
And they tell me that helps a lot.

01:09:48.389 --> 01:09:53.618
If you put that drag shoot on, you save the
brakes and you save those tires, too.

01:09:53.618 --> 01:09:58.159
And it also tends to stabilize you to keep
it going straight down the runway.

01:09:58.159 --> 01:10:02.550
Even with the crosswind?

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.639
Even with the crosswind, yeah.

01:10:03.639 --> 01:10:08.960
And you have to realize that this has to be
designed not just for a landing at Kennedy

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.449
Space Center or at Edwards where you have
a three mile long runway.

01:10:12.449 --> 01:10:18.340
Like Allen said, you've got contingency runways
around the world where you might be landing

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.420
with just two miles.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:27.409
And that is when this stuff is really going
to save your bacon.

01:10:27.409 --> 01:10:34.409
We were proponents of the drag shoot for a
long time mainly to save those tires and the

01:10:37.119 --> 01:10:41.269
brakes and get the cost back in there.

01:10:41.269 --> 01:10:43.999
It was added in 1992.

01:10:43.999 --> 01:10:45.739
And so with all of that.

01:10:45.739 --> 01:10:50.479
After I told you all of that, I was a little
bit negative, just to let you know, that everything

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.679
doesn't go smooth.

01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:57.429
If it does not go smoothly when you do engineering,
I would suggest to you that you're probably

01:10:57.429 --> 01:11:00.179
going to have the same kind of situations.

01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:03.210
Just concluding comments.

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:08.289
The tire design on development had margins
to meet all the initial requirements, and

01:11:08.289 --> 01:11:09.139
they did fine.

01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:13.800
It is still flying and flies well, a good
vehicle.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:19.340
We only had one tire failure, and the professor
was a witness there, he was there.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:24.090
We could have had a longer life on all that,
but the clear issue was really weights and

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:24.809
money.

01:11:24.809 --> 01:11:30.719
Again, it is one of those systems engineering
things where you have to trade that off.

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:33.449
The wheels performed a design.

01:11:33.449 --> 01:11:40.449
Even better because we didn't have any leakage
in six months on the pad which was great for

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:41.800
us.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:47.300
The beryllium brakes functioned but were sporadically
marginal.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.820
The KSC runway had friction and rough surfaces
but that is fixed so everything is pretty

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.260
good now.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.949
The initial design of the requirements and
improvements have continued, and I am sure

01:11:56.949 --> 01:12:01.239
that they will continue until the Orbiter
doesn't fly anymore.

01:12:01.239 --> 01:12:03.199
And I am going to stop right there.

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:04.510
You've had enough of me for a little bit.

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:08.019
Any questions on this stuff?

01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:10.860
What did you think about that concrete?

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.090
Did you pass that stuff around?

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.670
Isn't that something?

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:15.229
It fools you, doesn't it?

01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:17.179
I had never been to the Cape.

01:12:17.179 --> 01:12:19.599
It is a lot rougher than you think.

01:12:19.599 --> 01:12:24.340
And you see that stuff and say what were we
thinking?

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.929
That's no good for a big tire like that.

01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:28.479
OK, gang.

01:12:28.479 --> 01:12:35.380
I will just finish the story of this 51D flight
that Allen mentioned.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.690
It was the sixteenth flight of the Shuttle.

01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:40.940
It was my first flight.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.539
And actually there were seven people onboard.

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:46.239
Six of us were rookies, so we had never been
in space before.

01:12:46.239 --> 01:12:51.880
And the commander had only been in space once
and he was in charge.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.920
And it was quite an exciting flight because
we had a malfunctioning satellite, we had

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.539
to do an unplanned spacewalk.

01:12:59.539 --> 01:13:02.119
We did an unplanned rendezvous with a satellite.

01:13:02.119 --> 01:13:04.369
And so lots of stuff had happened.

01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:08.699
And then we came in re-entry.

01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:15.699
And I just remember the deal was, as Allen
said, the nose wheel steering was built in,

01:13:16.869 --> 01:13:18.610
but it was a single string system.

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:25.610
There was only one hydraulic loop in the nose
gear.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.340
And if that went hard over then you will leave
the runway.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:38.219
And so Gastros decided that until they made
that redundant we weren't going to use the

01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:39.929
nose wheel steering.

01:13:39.929 --> 01:13:45.090
In order to steer down the runway, you put
even more or less pressure on the right or

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:45.760
the left brake.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.030
It turned out that we landed with the max
crosswind.

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:58.030
We had a crosswind from the right side, I
believe, and so wanted to blow the Orbiter

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.369
over to the left side of the runway.

01:14:01.369 --> 01:14:08.369
And so the commander had to put extra brakes
on the right wheel.

01:14:08.579 --> 01:14:10.380
And so that was what was heating up.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:16.269
And I just remember, because I was sitting
right behind him up on the flight deck, we

01:14:16.269 --> 01:14:22.139
touched down, everything went fine down the
runway, the nose wheel came down and we could

01:14:22.139 --> 01:14:25.869
feel the deceleration.

01:14:25.869 --> 01:14:29.050
I thought we were just about stopped.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:34.449
And I remember thinking to myself it's all
over, nothing can go wrong now.

01:14:34.449 --> 01:14:37.909
Boom, the whole Orbiter shook.

01:14:37.909 --> 01:14:41.670
I mean I really thought that one of the fuel
tanks had blown up or something.

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:44.300
It was really impressive.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.099
And, like Allen said, these things put out
a lot of shrapnel.

01:14:49.099 --> 01:14:54.269
In fact, after most flights, sometimes you
will see the crew get out and walk around

01:14:54.269 --> 01:14:59.699
and kind of kick the tires and just sort of
pat the Orbiter and say thank you for a nice

01:14:59.699 --> 01:15:00.900
flight and all that.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:07.710
But they made everybody get out of there because
the other tires, obviously, were overheated

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.260
as well and they were worried that they were
break.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.989
But, as Yogi Bear said, it ain't over till
it's over.

01:15:12.989 --> 01:15:15.190
And it was exciting.

01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:22.130
But after that they fixed the nose wheel steering,
they got rid of the beryllium brakes and replaced

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:26.289
them with carbon, they put in the drag shoot,
and we really haven't had any problems since.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:32.130
And I think it's a really good example of
the whole engineering process where you build

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.409
in margin.

01:15:33.409 --> 01:15:39.449
And that is absolutely critical when you're
designing a system.

01:15:39.449 --> 01:15:44.849
And then going through the testing and then
the operation and then closing the loop.

01:15:44.849 --> 01:15:50.309
Once you find out how these systems really
operate then, if you have the ability to make

01:15:50.309 --> 01:15:54.510
changes, you can go in and improve them.

01:15:54.510 --> 01:16:01.510
Let's take our two-minute break, stand up,
turn around and then we'll take up again with

01:16:01.769 --> 01:16:04.860
the manipulator systems.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:11.440
Start up again with a different mechanical
system.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:18.440
In this case the manipulator system which
is the space crane.

01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:22.280
That's a good term for it.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.280
It is a space crane.

01:16:29.849 --> 01:16:33.809
This is a whole different way we did this.

01:16:33.809 --> 01:16:39.929
When the Orbiter was built there were several
sized payload bays.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:43.389
One was 30 feet and one was 60 feet.

01:16:43.389 --> 01:16:50.389
And it turned out that we did not really have
a system to handle the payload where you were

01:16:51.409 --> 01:16:55.199
going to carry the payload, but we really
didn't have them at the time.

01:16:55.199 --> 01:17:02.199
Altitude and inclination varied.

01:17:02.729 --> 01:17:06.389
Here was the significant capability we had
to do.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:11.440
We had to do 65,000 pounds, 15 foot in diameter
and about 60 feet long.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.849
That is about the size of a greyhound bus.

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:22.610
And we really did not have any system to handle
it.

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:27.840
The thoughts were don't worry, we will spring
it out, we'll throw it out, but we had no

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.300
retrievalment methods.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:38.300
Besides that, another systems engineering
problem, most of the resources in the program

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:44.590
were on the Orbiter, or just to get the shuttle
flying.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:51.380
And there was really not a lot of attention
paid to the payloads in the early days.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:56.999
In addition to that, when you look back, the
ongoing programs were Skylab.

01:17:56.999 --> 01:17:59.340
We had Skylab still going.

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:04.409
We had Apollo-Soyez just about ready to fly.

01:18:04.409 --> 01:18:05.920
And then the prime objective, the Orbiter.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.710
All these things contributed to the fact that
it was a little later in getting this started

01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:18.710
than perhaps it should have been.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.550
All the NASA centers had a concept.

01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:29.360
Marshall had a concept.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.679
We did not have a concept at Johnson at the
time.

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:38.679
We were doing some off-line work on manipulators,
but the initial part was not for the Shuttle.

01:18:42.679 --> 01:18:48.499
We had some systems that were pretty good
for deployment, but we had no system for retrieval

01:18:48.499 --> 01:18:50.309
at the time.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:56.780
That was a problem.

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.710
The manipulator became a crane.

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:05.050
It essentially became a contender once we
understood a little bit more about the requirements.

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:10.369
And the one that came up that said we have
to go capture a satellite.

01:19:10.369 --> 01:19:15.389
That is the one that was the real driver for
the manipulator.

01:19:15.389 --> 01:19:22.389
We

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:29.219
had some studies going on.

01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:30.999
I guess you guys call it robotics.

01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:37.999
And we had found that we could get from General
Electric some of the Atomic Energy Commission

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:48.630
which they used to handle the very critical
elements.

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:51.280
And we were just working on it.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.999
And this was a side issue.

01:19:52.999 --> 01:19:54.229
We were doing this technology.

01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:58.960
It had nothing to do with the Orbiter at the
time.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.320
And we decided, after a while, that we liked
the way it worked and what we would do is

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.900
just make an extension of that, so we did.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:12.590
And we decided that we would try to go to
handling system.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.949
And we did.

01:20:12.949 --> 01:20:18.459
I'm not sure.

01:20:18.459 --> 01:20:24.349
Is master slave a good term for robotics these
days?

01:20:24.349 --> 01:20:28.309
Let me tell you what a master slave is.

01:20:28.309 --> 01:20:32.030
The hand controllers or whatever you're using
looks just like the manipulator.

01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:33.110
You have a little bitty one over here.

01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:35.670
You've got a big one over here.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.269
We were using a master slave kind of system.

01:20:38.269 --> 01:20:45.269
And we found out right off that if you've
made an arm that long and you try to put it

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.729
in the crew cabin, it took up a lot of volume
in the crew cabin.

01:20:48.729 --> 01:20:51.619
And so we didn't have that much room to start
with.

01:20:51.619 --> 01:20:54.300
That became an issue right off.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:21:00.110
The other issue was that we found out that
when we were working with the AEC kind of

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:05.539
things that dexterity and feedback was very
important because they didn't want to drop

01:21:05.539 --> 01:21:05.949
this thing.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:07.280
They wanted to be sure they could handle it.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:14.280
But we really didn't need that.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.760
We decided that we had to have a larger system
than that.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:26.760
And we also found that during these tests
the fellow would hold his arms up and would

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.239
get tired.

01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:33.340
We decided if we got a barber he would be
the guy that could operate this thing better

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.590
than any of us.

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:37.699
That's a 1G problem.

01:21:37.699 --> 01:21:40.789
Even there, for training, he would get tired
so easily.

01:21:40.789 --> 01:21:44.340
But we never found a barber that could do
it.

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:51.340
And we kept the master slave concept for future
testing.

01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:59.559
Just so we understand what a master slave
is, let's take a quick look at this.

01:21:59.699 --> 01:22:03.050
Here is the master.

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:07.860
You can go over and grab the hand controller
right up here.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:13.889
And, as you move that hand controller, this
piece over here moves exactly like you move

01:22:13.889 --> 01:22:16.170
the hand controller and the arm.

01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:22.110
Now, that is interesting because if this is
one foot and that is 50 feet, you get a radio

01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:25.239
of about 1:50.

01:22:25.239 --> 01:22:29.590
Instead of being able to move it like we wanted,
you now have to ratchet the thing every time

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.979
you did it.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.229
It took more space.

01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:37.179
So, we decided that really was not a good
idea.

01:22:37.179 --> 01:22:43.889
In addition to that, we found that the manipulator
that we had was really too small for what

01:22:43.889 --> 01:22:48.349
we really wanted to do.

01:22:48.349 --> 01:22:55.349
And the other problem was that the GE hydraulic
manipulator was probably not what we were

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.530
going to fly in space.

01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:04.280
We did not want to fly a hydraulic system
that would leak.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.659
Now we had a problem between hydraulics and
electrics, which now we had to do some modeling

01:23:09.659 --> 01:23:09.909
on.

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:16.860
Of all things, we had some money from the
NASA Medical Group.

01:23:17.869 --> 01:23:23.030
We told them what we wanted to do, they gave
us some money and we went and bought a manipulator

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.699
from GE.

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:28.170
They got it from Pittsburg Plate and Glass.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:33.849
It was about 25 to 27 feet long and it had
a suction end effector on it.

01:23:33.849 --> 01:23:38.309
And what they would do is pick up these big
pieces of glass and move them.

01:23:38.309 --> 01:23:45.309
We bought their manipulator for about $50,000,
I think, but it was medical money of all things.

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:53.190
And it had a master slave and it had a vacuum
end detector.

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:59.699
We decided that there were several things
that we had to analyze just to get this thing

01:23:59.699 --> 01:24:00.840
started.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.269
One was the master slave, and we decided we
wanted an alternate concept.

01:24:04.269 --> 01:24:06.820
That one didn't even work.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:10.800
The feedback versus fixed hand controllers
was the other one.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.869
A lot of people wanted feedback.

01:24:11.869 --> 01:24:15.800
Do you do robotics with feedback, too?

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.559
Any of you in robotics?

01:24:18.559 --> 01:24:25.559
I can tell you anything, can't it?

01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.340
[LAUGHTER]
Well, we didn't think we need it.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:35.380
The viewing, the line of site turned out to
be another issue.

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:42.380
When you look at it, in the Orbiter, we had
it at the aft station.

01:24:42.429 --> 01:24:47.050
And looking back, at the time, there were
no windows facing out.

01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:53.780
What we did for the first time was put TVs
on the Orbiter to use it.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:59.639
So, the initial test was to see if we could
do things with the TVs.

01:24:59.639 --> 01:25:01.530
We decided that was an issue.

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:06.369
The end effector configuration was really
never solved until about the end, and that's

01:25:06.369 --> 01:25:12.059
the thing that is the grabber that you have
to grab this thing with.

01:25:12.059 --> 01:25:15.260
And the power source we got fairly early.

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.550
We did not want to use hydraulics.

01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:26.550
The other thing was the tip speed, and that
is the speed at which the tip of the manipulator

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:29.690
has to move so you can do things with it.

01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:34.920
The problem we had is if we are going to capture
a satellite and we had a relative velocity

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.229
between the Orbiter and a satellite, since
the guy was going to have to move this thing,

01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:46.119
but we didn't have a requirement so we had
to go work on that.

01:25:46.119 --> 01:25:48.459
Payload and cargo handling was the other.

01:25:48.459 --> 01:25:52.709
We knew that we were going to handle 64,000
pounds.

01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:56.400
And the manipulators we were working on weren't
going to do it.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.199
And, of course, the satellite capturing and
retrieval was what I've already talked about.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:10.199
We did a little modeling and converted

01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:25.070
some things at the center.

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:32.070
We decided that we had to have a high bay,
a big room, so we got a room that was Building

01:26:33.459 --> 01:26:40.459
13 and we built a plastic floor that was very
smooth and put payloads on air bearings.

01:26:41.309 --> 01:26:44.110
And then we mounted our manipulator right
next to it.

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:51.110
Then what we would do is, on the air bearing
floor, everybody would push this 5,000 or

01:26:56.199 --> 01:26:58.300
6,000 pound payload across the floor.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.159
And we had two strips where we could get the
velocity of what was going.

01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:07.469
And we decided that we would try to find out
what the tip speed had to be to capture at

01:27:07.469 --> 01:27:09.170
certain velocities, so we did that.

01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:16.170
And we just had very, very simple-minded effectors,
but it worked fairly good.

01:27:16.389 --> 01:27:18.429
We also worked on stationary.

01:27:18.429 --> 01:27:25.429
These payloads right here, after using this
floor for probably a year and a half, we came

01:27:28.639 --> 01:27:31.050
up with some requirements.

01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:33.349
We couldn't use a master slave.

01:27:33.349 --> 01:27:35.489
The feedback didn't really help us.

01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:37.499
It was just too big.

01:27:37.499 --> 01:27:43.949
Tell you what, if you ever look at the linemen
these days that go up and fix these high lines,

01:27:43.949 --> 01:27:48.239
their manipulator, their system is similar
to what we have.

01:27:48.239 --> 01:27:54.519
We have a little bit more sophistication in
the avionics, but it is very, very similar.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:57.269
Mechanically they are very, very similar.

01:27:57.269 --> 01:28:01.989
The line of site would be required.

01:28:01.989 --> 01:28:08.909
We had an astronaut come over and use the
manipulator.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:14.489
We gave him a TV and then put what it is called
an eye mark recorder on his head.

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:19.079
And what this eye mark record was is it looked
into your eyes, and when you looked at something

01:28:19.079 --> 01:28:22.780
out here on a TV over here, you could see
where he was looking.

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:28.229
Then we ran a test to see, while he was operating
to capture these satellites, whether he was

01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:32.659
looking at the satellite -- I'm sorry, the
TV, or while he was going line of sight.

01:28:32.659 --> 01:28:39.659
It turned out, it was very interesting, it
was 60% he was looking line of sight and 40%

01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:42.340
on the TV.

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:49.340
At the time, there was no aft window, so we
went to Rockwell and they decided to put the

01:28:51.019 --> 01:28:51.769
aft windows.

01:28:51.769 --> 01:28:54.739
Again, here is one of those problems.

01:28:54.739 --> 01:28:56.050
The aft window is about that thick.

01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:58.630
It pure quartz and is very, very heavy.

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.739
And nobody wanted to put them in.

01:29:00.739 --> 01:29:03.139
I think we had some overhead windows in to
start with.

01:29:03.139 --> 01:29:04.849
I'm not real sure about that.

01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:07.940
But we have overhead windows in there and
aft windows.

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.280
So, we got those put in.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:16.280
We also defined the end effector speed, the
tip speed.

01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:20.530
We found out that about foot per second was
about all he needed.

01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:25.110
Other than that, probably the satellite was
moving so fast and it probably wasn't safe

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:29.749
to do it so we settled on that.

01:29:29.749 --> 01:29:32.969
We decided that we could capture satellites.

01:29:32.969 --> 01:29:36.300
That was done.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:43.300
And we again said we could not see using hydraulics
on this system at all.

01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:47.929
So, we moved to a bigger building.

01:29:47.929 --> 01:29:54.929
Now we built a 60 x 80 foot floor and ran
satellites across it, a very smooth floor.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:30:02.659
The smoothness of the floor, we had a little
hole in the middle that was 0.009 inches deep,

01:30:02.659 --> 01:30:09.659
and we shot the whole thing with a laser and
got the floor built.

01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:15.219
We also needed an Orbiter mockup so we built
an Orbiter mockup to about where it would

01:30:15.219 --> 01:30:17.709
be on the Orbiter.

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:19.260
We got the floor built.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:22.709
That should be 80.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:29.510
The manipulator was now 50 feet long, so we
had to make it 50 feet long.

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:33.900
But the problem was, since we were going to
use the electrical system instead of the hydraulic

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:39.349
system, now we had to make that hydraulic
system think it was operating like an electrical

01:30:39.349 --> 01:30:40.619
system.

01:30:40.619 --> 01:30:45.880
What we did was, on the electrical system,
if you put the arm straight out and you lift

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.829
it, we had a first cut at 100 pounds.

01:30:48.829 --> 01:30:55.050
Now in orbit it is inertia that is going to
get you, but on the ground we said we will

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.110
hold this thing out at 100 pounds for the
electrical system.

01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:05.110
So, we modeled the hydraulic system to work
just like that.

01:31:06.869 --> 01:31:09.429
Also, we needed a lower scale payload.

01:31:09.429 --> 01:31:10.219
We did not have any.

01:31:10.219 --> 01:31:12.030
Remember what I was telling you a minute age?

01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:16.150
60 feet by 15 feet is about the size of a
greyhound bus.

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:20.989
Was what we were trying to work on.

01:31:20.989 --> 01:31:26.670
And we also went to a fixed hand controller
which drove us into the hydraulics business.

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:26.989
I'm sorry, into the avionics business.

01:31:26.989 --> 01:31:33.989
Before we did that we had to figure out a
way to handle payloads.

01:31:36.729 --> 01:31:42.269
And so what we did was we had looked up some
of these people who were loggers up in the

01:31:42.269 --> 01:31:48.260
Northeast, and they were using essentially
a dirigible to take the logs down.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.519
And they were big, about like what we wanted.

01:31:50.519 --> 01:31:55.820
We got that company, Sheldahl, I think was
the company, to build this thing and put helium

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.150
in it.

01:31:57.150 --> 01:32:01.900
And it turned out something this big has a
tremendous inertia, which was great because

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.110
that was what we wanted.

01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:05.809
We didn't want it to be heavy but we wanted
the inertia.

01:32:05.809 --> 01:32:09.860
Plus, we got a little resistance from the
air when we moved it around.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:15.130
We had to take that one and show that we could
grab it and put it in the payload bay.

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:21.449
And that took a while because when you get
it all set around, when you start putting

01:32:21.449 --> 01:32:26.229
it down near the payload bay, say there is
the aft station of the payload bay, you find

01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:27.800
out that you cannot see anything.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:33.880
Now you really are on the TVs and you really
have to get that manipulator where it knows

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.209
where it is.

01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:36.110
That was the other thing.

01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:40.349
We found that once you started drop some of
these payloads you will want to automate a

01:32:40.349 --> 01:32:41.949
whole bunch of this stuff.

01:32:41.949 --> 01:32:48.949
In addition to that, when you look at the
requirements, just putting it in the payload

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.070
bay is kind of interesting, but once you get
it in there you've got to hold it.

01:32:57.070 --> 01:33:01.650
What we did is -- There is the trunnion right
there.

01:33:01.650 --> 01:33:07.190
You can see right there is where the trunnion
goes in there.

01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:11.459
This thing comes back, it opens up and it's
like a big latch.

01:33:11.459 --> 01:33:15.459
If you can drop that thing in there, you can
just put it in there.

01:33:15.459 --> 01:33:19.199
Now, that is not so easy so I will show you.

01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.099
We built some guides.

01:33:20.099 --> 01:33:24.380
But the other thing was none of the payloads
were all the same size.

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:28.079
What we had to do is, this is the longeron
right there.

01:33:28.079 --> 01:33:30.539
There is that longeron in there.

01:33:30.539 --> 01:33:35.860
And so we had these bridge fittings that you
could move along and move all along the payload

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.420
bay.

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:43.420
Now anybody that came along with any kind
of size of payload we could now accommodate

01:33:43.539 --> 01:33:44.130
those fellows.

01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:45.969
And it worked fairly well.

01:33:45.969 --> 01:33:48.409
And we had done that.

01:33:48.409 --> 01:33:55.409
The other part was once you got the trunnion
latch you had to get this thing in there.

01:34:00.119 --> 01:34:06.499
What we did was we tried a lot of schemes,
but this was one that worked.

01:34:06.499 --> 01:34:08.619
Let me start with this side.

01:34:08.619 --> 01:34:09.800
There is the trunnion.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:16.800
That is essentially these guys right here.

01:34:21.219 --> 01:34:24.280
Those are the trunnions.

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:31.280
When you look at the trunnion it sticks out
of there and it just drops down into the payload

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.840
bay and it goes into that latch.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:39.079
But getting it into that latch is not that
easy because you really cannot see sometimes.

01:34:39.079 --> 01:34:42.199
What we did was built a thing called a V Guide.

01:34:42.199 --> 01:34:45.969
This is the V Guide right here.

01:34:45.969 --> 01:34:50.019
And the V Guide over here is right there.

01:34:50.019 --> 01:34:54.599
And then we have a scuff plate so that once
you drop it in the V Guide this scuff plate

01:34:54.599 --> 01:34:59.519
kept the payload from hitting up against that
latch.

01:34:59.519 --> 01:35:06.519
And they are still using the same concept.

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.659
Here is what we really went with.

01:35:10.659 --> 01:35:11.978
Not master slave anymore.

01:35:11.978 --> 01:35:18.978
I'm sure in robotics labs or something you
probably go to hand controllers like this.

01:35:19.939 --> 01:35:26.179
We went out and looked at a lot of the cranes
that people work with, and we found out that

01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:33.179
these three motors right here all were parallel,
their rotation was parallel.

01:35:34.679 --> 01:35:41.679
What we did was put sort of the auxiliary
placement things outside those three things,

01:35:43.159 --> 01:35:46.380
just the way the linemen do out there now.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.949
They do not have a hand controller.

01:35:49.949 --> 01:35:55.820
They have a switch box or they have little
handles that they use.

01:35:55.820 --> 01:36:00.610
That is essentially the configuration that
we started with on there.

01:36:00.610 --> 01:36:06.949
And, if you look at it, this is a little more
complex.

01:36:06.949 --> 01:36:13.949
And about this time we had had enough work
with the manipulator that we had that we had

01:36:14.659 --> 01:36:21.579
built in-house a 50 foot model that we could
use and prove to the Program Office that we

01:36:21.579 --> 01:36:23.059
could handle the payloads.

01:36:23.059 --> 01:36:30.059
We had the big inflatables, we had the air-bearing
floor, and so the Shuttle Program Manager

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:32.320
said we're going to go with it.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.249
And the Air Force wants it so we're going
to use it.

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:42.260
At about that time, the Canadians decided
they wanted to be in the space and they are

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:45.650
the ones who came and asked us could they
build it.

01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:51.420
And people in Washington said yes, so our
division kind of backed off for a while and

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.380
they formed a program office with the Canadians.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:37:00.380
Actually, that is a Canadian arm called the
Canada Arm.

01:37:01.219 --> 01:37:03.219
Well, you know, you've got to have everything.

01:37:03.219 --> 01:37:10.219
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:13.599
This is the longeron in the Orbiter.

01:37:13.599 --> 01:37:16.050
This right here is the longeron in the Orbiter.

01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:20.570
And these are just little sort of wrists,
and they will latch it in.

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:24.360
And you can see that we got the TVs here.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:31.360
I think that probably this gives you a little
better feel for the rotation.

01:37:31.809 --> 01:37:38.809
We had one rotation that the first thing we
had to do was, because when the payload bay

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:45.840
doors closed, they closed on top of this thing
so what you had to do was roll the manipulator

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:51.420
out because we had to get it out of the way
so there would be no interference with the

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.679
payload bay doors.

01:37:52.679 --> 01:37:58.130
There is a degree of freedom that is really
just repositions the thing.

01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:04.228
And then after that there is five degrees
of freedom on there at least.

01:38:04.228 --> 01:38:11.228
And if you start from the back here that first
joint is a yaw.

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:18.209
And then all three of these center joints
are translation.

01:38:18.209 --> 01:38:23.550
And then there is a roll up here and there
is a pitch up here.

01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:28.409
We could go to any place with the end effector
if we had the tip speed and we had enough

01:38:28.409 --> 01:38:30.329
joints.

01:38:30.329 --> 01:38:37.329
The problem was that when we did this and
we tried to build some gear trains and we

01:38:38.519 --> 01:38:43.209
found out that you didn't want to back drive
this arm.

01:38:43.209 --> 01:38:45.360
You caught something and it back drives.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.760
We did that a lot with the inflatables.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:55.760
If you use spur gears you would strip the
gears out, so we went to roller gears or essentially

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.978
the planetary type gears.

01:38:57.978 --> 01:39:03.510
I think the Canadians now have all these interior
angles or all those roller gears.

01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:10.510
In the interest of time, since I am going
on, here is the manipulator and this is the

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.579
aft station.

01:39:26.579 --> 01:39:28.030
And I have a little better one of that.

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:34.550
But about the time that we were just about
to get this thing proven, we found out that

01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:36.539
people in the world were very interested in
this.

01:39:36.539 --> 01:39:43.539
We had a Russian general want to come see
us, so we said OK and we entertained the Russian

01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:46.659
general.

01:39:46.659 --> 01:39:51.599
We wanted to show him that even though the
arm was about 40 feet long that we were very

01:39:51.599 --> 01:39:57.300
dexterous so we were going to pour him a glass
of water.

01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:04.099
And we did, except when we got the general
there and I walked in, they had the glass,

01:40:04.099 --> 01:40:05.679
but the water wasn't in what I thought it
was in.

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:09.010
It was in a vodka bottle.

01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:10.579
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:10.579 --> 01:40:17.579
And there is no liquor allowed on a federal
installation.

01:40:17.969 --> 01:40:24.969
And I'm sitting there and the guide is looking
at me and I'm saying there goes that job.

01:40:26.469 --> 01:40:26.719
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:30.860
I told the general, his interpreter, hold
your glass there so that you got the bottle.

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.579
Real nice.

01:40:31.579 --> 01:40:33.489
The guy was really good at the manipulator.

01:40:33.489 --> 01:40:35.019
He poured it in there.

01:40:35.019 --> 01:40:37.329
Fortunately it was water.

01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:38.579
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:38.579 --> 01:40:44.969
But we actually poured a glass of water out
of vodka bottle for the general.

01:40:44.969 --> 01:40:48.360
But I thought my time at NASA had come to
an end.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.659
You guys wouldn't do that, would you?

01:40:53.659 --> 01:40:53.909
No.
It would have been vodka.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:55.478
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:55.478 --> 01:40:57.630
Yeah, they'd use the vodka.

01:40:57.630 --> 01:40:59.239
Nowadays, they might use the vodka.

01:40:59.239 --> 01:41:04.159
I hadn't thought about that.

01:41:04.159 --> 01:41:06.090
Well, let me go on here.

01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:13.090
I was going to point out one thing here that
the TVs turn out to be a very important part

01:41:14.809 --> 01:41:17.439
of this whole thing.

01:41:17.439 --> 01:41:22.570
Once you get a payload and you sort of are
blind, now you have lots of TVs you can use.

01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:24.110
There are four on Orbiter.

01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:30.228
There are two up front, two on the back bulked
and there is one on the end effector so that

01:41:30.228 --> 01:41:36.010
you can sort of see where you're going for
the last engagement.

01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:41.719
And you can see here there is the aft station,
there are the windows.

01:41:41.719 --> 01:41:44.539
Now, he's got a pretty good line of site if
there is nothing in there.

01:41:44.539 --> 01:41:48.860
If there is a docking tunnel in there that
makes it a little more difficult.

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.539
Did you have a docketing tunnel?

01:41:53.539 --> 01:41:58.670
You just had a place where you could set it.

01:41:58.670 --> 01:42:03.719
My favorite thing, for this gentleman, is
that fixing the Hubble to me was the greatest

01:42:03.719 --> 01:42:04.939
thing that we have ever done.

01:42:04.939 --> 01:42:07.449
And I hope they do it again some time.

01:42:07.449 --> 01:42:10.689
And the manipulator always plays a part in
that.

01:42:10.689 --> 01:42:16.389
The only other thing that we did that was
interesting, early on we built an end effector

01:42:16.389 --> 01:42:18.999
where the astronaut could stand on it.

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:24.829
Our first cut at this was to do it like the
guys that do the high lines, and we put all

01:42:24.829 --> 01:42:27.439
the controls out on the end effector.

01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:29.920
The Canadians did not like that.

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.699
It complicated things.

01:42:32.699 --> 01:42:39.699
Remember, we only had about 120 kilobytes
total for the computer for this thing and

01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:42.689
that was it.

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:47.780
They didn't want to waste any more and they
didn't want all the weight.

01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:53.519
I guess the astronauts or someone said we'll
go with just a foot stand and then we will

01:42:53.519 --> 01:42:56.619
control it from the aft station here.

01:42:56.619 --> 01:42:59.670
And I think that's the way you do it now,
isn't it?

01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:00.559
Yeah.

01:43:00.559 --> 01:43:05.728
It was a tough battle, but weight and cost
won out again.

01:43:05.728 --> 01:43:12.728
It's tough to beat them.

01:43:14.670 --> 01:43:21.670
These aren't really that great, but you can
see that this thing takes up a lot of control

01:43:22.499 --> 01:43:25.869
panel in the aft station of the Orbiter.

01:43:25.869 --> 01:43:27.860
It really does.

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.900
And here are the windows right there.

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:35.010
And there is an overhead window.

01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:42.010
We thought at one time that what we would
have to do, the arm is here, this aft, there

01:43:43.269 --> 01:43:46.539
was a payload that wanted the arm to come
back this way.

01:43:46.539 --> 01:43:49.880
If it did that you had to have that window.

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.880
A very strange thing happened, because when
you turn your arm back that way, right is

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.320
left and left is right.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:03.320
We had to practice the reverse of everything
or get a mirror or something.

01:44:04.519 --> 01:44:05.550
We tried a lot of it.

01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:11.579
The Program Office wisely decided that was
not a good idea so they were going to handle

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:12.989
that payload another way.

01:44:12.989 --> 01:44:18.079
I wish I could remember exactly what it was.

01:44:18.079 --> 01:44:23.969
There are two hand controller here, and here
they are right here.

01:44:23.969 --> 01:44:27.739
This was a lot more fun than wheels, brakes
and tires.

01:44:27.739 --> 01:44:30.130
This was a fun project.

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:35.019
And this is the translation controller.

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:37.630
You've operated this one.

01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:42.059
And there is the rotational hand controller.

01:44:42.059 --> 01:44:48.228
This one on the left essentially operates
the three center joints where it goes like

01:44:48.228 --> 01:44:48.478
that.

01:44:48.269 --> 01:44:54.889
And then all the others are done with this
hand controller.

01:44:54.889 --> 01:44:57.150
I think those are pretty normal flight controllers,
aren't they?

01:44:57.150 --> 01:44:59.650
Those are the ones you used.

01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:03.920
At least we thought it was.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:10.630
The biggest argument we had with the Canadians
was this, the end effector.

01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:17.530
That is the hand, the thing that grabs it.

01:45:17.530 --> 01:45:21.019
We wanted one that was more dextrose.

01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:27.099
They argued, and rightfully so, that what
we really wanted was one that would make a

01:45:27.099 --> 01:45:29.929
good sturdy latch.

01:45:29.929 --> 01:45:31.619
And this one does.

01:45:31.619 --> 01:45:36.860
The way this works is that there are three
little wires in here, three cables that come

01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:43.860
in, so once this end effector is placed over
this grapple pin here these wires close.

01:45:46.679 --> 01:45:53.679
And, as they close, they also move back and
they grab on the end of that pin right there

01:45:55.019 --> 01:46:00.959
and pull this end effector into this shoulder
right here.

01:46:00.959 --> 01:46:07.639
Now, in the meantime, there is a docking target
that he looks at that he can see.

01:46:07.639 --> 01:46:12.478
Now, once it sits on this shoulder that really
is a good structural latch.

01:46:12.478 --> 01:46:14.119
You've got a great structural latch.

01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:20.400
And if this indexes you can also make an electrical
connection across there, which some payload

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.719
is willing to do.

01:46:22.719 --> 01:46:27.449
Now you make a capture latch which is essentially
the way you do docking a lot of times.

01:46:27.449 --> 01:46:34.449
You make a capture latch with these wires
that actually just close around this thing.

01:46:35.249 --> 01:46:41.179
Then it pulls it back, sets it on these shoulders
and now you have a nice sturdy thing.

01:46:41.179 --> 01:46:43.909
And the Canadians did a good job there.

01:46:43.909 --> 01:46:44.728
I have to tell them that.

01:46:44.728 --> 01:46:49.949
The problem with that is the one we had on
the nose of your steering.

01:46:49.949 --> 01:46:56.590
We had ten single point failures in there
which makes you nervous, particularly if you're

01:46:56.590 --> 01:46:59.939
hauling a big payload or an expensive payload.

01:46:59.939 --> 01:47:02.728
However, they did a good job.

01:47:02.728 --> 01:47:09.728
Reliability has never failed that I know of,
so that was a good thing that they did.

01:47:10.499 --> 01:47:15.809
This was a lot more fun than the wheels, brakes
and tires guys.

01:47:15.809 --> 01:47:20.119
Then the only other thing is we had a backup
mode.

01:47:20.119 --> 01:47:22.709
We were afraid.

01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:28.469
At the time we weren't that enthused with
computers so we wanted a backup mode.

01:47:28.469 --> 01:47:34.079
So, we got everybody to go to a single joint
mode.

01:47:34.079 --> 01:47:40.199
What we did was hardwired all the joints and
put a box on the control panel so you could

01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:42.679
move each joint singularly.

01:47:42.679 --> 01:47:45.709
And that was the backup mode.

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:51.539
You can do it with a single joint or you can
do it computer supported.

01:47:51.539 --> 01:47:52.219
You can do it either way.

01:47:52.219 --> 01:47:55.489
And we also had to have a jettison mode.

01:47:55.489 --> 01:48:00.840
If this thing stuck out there, you would have
to throw it overboard because you couldn't

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.320
close the doors.

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.300
We had to get rid of it.

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.289
The Canadians thought that was not a good
idea.

01:48:07.289 --> 01:48:14.289
OK, last bit.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.189
This was a different project from the other
one I was talking to you about.

01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:21.070
This one did not start with any history at
all.

01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:23.030
We really had to start this one from scratch.

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:29.189
It is probably one of those things that came
along just at the right time.

01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:31.409
And we were studying some technology.

01:48:31.409 --> 01:48:38.409
And we had enough sense to convert, but it
essentially is just a big crane.

01:48:40.689 --> 01:48:47.689
I think that the thing that surprised us the
most was this one right here.

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:54.978
The crew took to this very, very easily.

01:48:54.978 --> 01:48:57.039
It took very little for them to do it.

01:48:57.039 --> 01:49:02.170
As a matter of fact, our simulator in Building
9A became a trainer forum.

01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:03.719
We were still doing development work.

01:49:03.719 --> 01:49:05.789
And they said, no, we're going to make this
a trainer.

01:49:05.789 --> 01:49:08.550
And those guys were pretty good.

01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:15.340
They came in, in very, very little time.

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.289
We had to do this.

01:49:16.289 --> 01:49:17.809
This was that inflatable testing.

01:49:17.809 --> 01:49:21.510
Remember on our other project I said you've
got to do the testing, you've got to prove

01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:22.889
the requirements?

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:28.189
Here was one where we did a little bit of
innovation with that big inflatable to show

01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:31.309
that we could meet the requirements.

01:49:31.309 --> 01:49:34.530
And we did.

01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:39.459
And surprisingly and happily working with
the Canadians was great fun.

01:49:39.459 --> 01:49:43.519
It was the first time I had ever worked with
any of the internationals, but it was great

01:49:43.519 --> 01:49:43.769
fun.

01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:47.150
And they did a great job on this thing.

01:49:47.150 --> 01:49:50.829
They are still upgrading it.

01:49:50.829 --> 01:49:52.459
It is still flying.

01:49:52.459 --> 01:49:54.630
And I'm taking up all your time I'm going
to take up.

01:49:54.630 --> 01:50:01.630
Just one or two things in finishing up.

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.059
Allen talked a lot about the importance of
testing.

01:50:07.059 --> 01:50:12.809
And this was a challenge with the arm because,
remember, all the stuff that we did with the

01:50:12.809 --> 01:50:15.449
inflatables, that was all done with a hydraulic
arm.

01:50:15.449 --> 01:50:21.050
The actual arm with the electric motors was
incapable of lifting its own weight in the

01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:21.659
earth's gravity.

01:50:21.659 --> 01:50:26.939
I remember going once up to the factory in
Canada, and the only testing that they could

01:50:26.939 --> 01:50:29.300
really do, they had a big air bearing floor
up there.

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:34.039
And they could use the electrical arm, but
only in two-dimensions.

01:50:34.039 --> 01:50:41.039
And so it didn't get its full three-dimensional
testing until STS-3, the third orbital flight

01:50:41.519 --> 01:50:43.179
test where they had the arm on.

01:50:43.179 --> 01:50:47.919
And that was the first real use where they
could put it through all the paces.

01:50:47.919 --> 01:50:49.079
But it really has worked well.

01:50:49.079 --> 01:50:54.949
And, in fact, you've all seen the picture
of the astronaut Bruce McCandless and the

01:50:54.949 --> 01:50:57.919
manned maneuvering unit flying off by himself.

01:50:57.919 --> 01:51:00.179
That has become like an icon.

01:51:00.179 --> 01:51:07.179
The reason that was originally built and fielded
was because people didn't think that the manipulator

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:13.429
arm would actually have the capability of
grabbing onto a moving or rotating satellite.

01:51:13.429 --> 01:51:19.179
And so the idea was that the astronauts would
have to go and catch it and then fly it or

01:51:19.179 --> 01:51:22.679
stabilize it so that you could come pick it
up with the manipulator.

01:51:22.679 --> 01:51:29.130
But, on the solar maximum repair, actually,
it turned out that they couldn't catch it

01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:34.630
with the manipulator because there was a configuration
problem and they couldn't latch it.

01:51:34.630 --> 01:51:39.429
And so they actually had to go after it with
the manipulator arm, while it was spinning,

01:51:39.429 --> 01:51:41.679
and they were able to get it.

01:51:41.679 --> 01:51:47.249
And, in fact, a lot of work that we did in
simulators showed that the manipulator had

01:51:47.249 --> 01:51:50.169
a lot better capability than we originally
thought it would.

01:51:50.169 --> 01:51:53.530
That was Joe Allen, right?

01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:56.079
Well, it was Terry Hart who actually caught
it.

01:51:56.079 --> 01:51:56.329
Terry Hart.
There was Pinky Nelson who went out.

01:51:57.909 --> 01:52:00.189
Joe and Dale went out to get [OVERLAPPING
VOICES].

01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:03.010
These were not big astronauts.

01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:04.320
They were a couple of the smaller guys.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:11.320
Anyway, just to end, the moral of this is
there is a lot of discussion often about humans

01:52:12.219 --> 01:52:14.249
and robots and who should be doing what.

01:52:14.249 --> 01:52:19.090
And I think a lot of people don't realize
that, from the very beginning, we have actually

01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.499
had a human robotic interaction on the Shuttle.

01:52:22.499 --> 01:52:28.260
And particularly for EVA activities it has
allowed -- And I will be talking about this

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:31.669
later in the term.

01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:34.130
We get humans and robotic systems working
together.

01:52:34.130 --> 01:52:38.010
Now, granted these are teleoperated robotic
systems.

01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:43.650
The real hardcore roboticists don't call it
robotics unless it's autonomous.

01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:50.650
But, nevertheless, it is a telerobotic system
that we use in combination with humans.

01:52:52.209 --> 01:52:55.789
And it has given us very great capabilities.

01:52:55.789 --> 01:52:59.189
OK, we will see you on Thursday.

01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:00.840
Let's see.

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.719
Oh, there is a lot of stuff.

01:53:03.719 --> 01:53:07.900
OMS, RCS, fuel cells, auxiliary power unit
and hydraulic systems.

01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:14.900
And also we will be looking for the outline,
the first cut on your reports.

01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:19.728
Henry will reveal you with all of that.

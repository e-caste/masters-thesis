00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.430
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let
me just introduce myself.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.820
And then maybe you all
can introduce yourselves

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.790
to me and to each other.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.409
So I'm Bill Bonvillian.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.450
And for the last 11 years,
I have been director

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.630
of MIT's Washington DC office.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.560
And I've taught at
Georgetown University

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.810
a course on science and tech
policy for about 12 years.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.880
And I teach a different course
on energy technology policy

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.110
at Johns Hopkins SAIS.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.435
So I'm on the edge on faculty
at Georgetown and Hopkins SAIS.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.120
And after 11 years of being
director of the Washington

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.010
office, I've stepped
down from that job.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.170
So I'm now a lecturer up here.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.110
And I've got an attachment
to MIT's Industrial Policy

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.290
Center, which is one
of its policy centers.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
And I'm finishing my
third book actually,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.950
which is now at MIT press
on advanced manufacturing.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.560
So you're going to hear
more than your share

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.380
about manufacturing
for this all over.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.030
You're stuck with
those realities.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.920
And I had a background in--

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.460
I was in the executive
branch as a child.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
And I was a Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Transportation

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.110
in my youth long
before any of you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.530
were born and got
to really engage

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.780
in the development
of major legislation

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.740
that deregulated most of the
big transportation sectors.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.050
So aviation, trucking,
and railroads and then

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.560
did a lot of work on
surface transportation.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.280
And then practiced law because
I've been trained as a lawyer.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.170
So I practiced law for a decade.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.340
And then somebody I knew and
had worked with at an earlier

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.050
stage became US senator.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.790
So I get one of those proverbial
Washington phone calls--

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.970
why don't you come up
and we'll talk, Bill?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.470
And that conversation
lasted for over 15 years.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.770
So I couldn't resist
staying up there.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
It was much too
interesting and fun.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.840
So I had a long career
working in the US senate

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.490
and worked on lots
of legislation

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.930
but including a lot of work on
innovation policy and science

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.630
policy and R&D policy.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.110
So that's kind of where I got
my training in this territory

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.990
was very much learning by doing.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.940
And then 11 years
ago, I went to MIT

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.275
to run their Washington office,
which has been a great joy.

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:01.900
So anyway, that's
kind of-- and then I,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.640
just as I said,
just stepped down

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.270
from that very
activist kind of job

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.150
to this life of
leisurely MIT faculty.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.130
Supposedly, I'm quasi retired.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.760
I doubt it.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.210
But anyway, that's
my background.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.632
Let me just say a
few things about how

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:25.840
this course is going to work.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.270
We know from a lot of studies,
that MIT's online crowd is now

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.200
doing about learning science,
that the talking head is not

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.460
an efficient way to learn.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.548
So we really need you all
participating in a class

00:03:45.548 --> 00:03:46.840
and coming into the discussion.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.140
So to further that--

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.192
and you saw my email kind
of introducing the course

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.150
and you've seen the
discussion in the syllabus.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.875
Those of you who haven't been
able to get online yet, stick

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:00.820
around after class and
let's make sure you get

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.070
registered and get access
to the online materials

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.278
and the background materials.

00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:07.540
So let's talk for a few
minutes after class.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.180
But essentially, we're going to
use a discussion leader system.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.399
And what that means is that
we'll all have five readings

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.440
or so for each class.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.510
And I'm going to ask all
of you to do those readings

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.330
and then do a short--

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.890
doesn't need to be
more than a page.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.650
It shouldn't really be more
than a page and a half--

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.460
some key bullet points
on the key findings

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.740
that you drew from
those readings

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.680
and a couple of questions.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.750
So that kind of gets
all of you thinking

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.570
about the readings on the way
in and some cute questions

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.430
you've got about the
readings so that you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.260
can help own the class.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.900
Because it only works
if you all own it.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.450
And then, in turn, we'll do
this discussion leader thing.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.190
So each week, I'll
ask a couple of you

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.420
to be leaders of the
Q&A part of the class.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.280
So here's how it will work.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.820
So I'll talk about any given
reading for maybe 10 minutes,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.160
maybe a little more than that.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.490
And then I'm going to turn it
over to the discussion leader

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.780
to kind of bring you all into
the review of the reading

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.850
so that you get to
participate in this

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.910
and get your thoughts
out on the table.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.820
And importantly, in terms
of your learning process,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.330
your thinking, your learning,
your speaking, all of those

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.250
are key to the learning process.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.310
One thing which we know
from MIT's online classes

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.300
and the learning science work
that's been going with them,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.550
is that the human memory fades
after more than 10 minutes

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.600
of the talking head.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.260
I mean, it is just
not rememberable.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.720
And it's very important to
change settings after that.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.780
So we're going to
change settings,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.402
and it's going to
be you, and you all

00:05:58.402 --> 00:06:00.110
are going to kind of
lead the next phase,

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.693
and then we'll go
to the next reading.

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:03.902
After we've talked about
the initial one for a while,

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:06.110
we'll go to the next reading,
and follow this pattern

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.070
through.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.980
And then I will always
try to summarize, either

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.610
at the beginning of the end
of the class, where we are,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.100
because we also know that
repetition is key to learning,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.127
too.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.710
So just a few elementary points
about learning science-- there

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.250
really is, actually,
some design here.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.920
The discussion leader stuff
is going to be very informal.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.480
This is going to
be very relaxed.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.820
I don't want you to be
concerned about having

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.350
to do fancy presentations.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.250
Just speak for a few minutes
about some key things

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.230
that you found about
the particular reading,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.420
and then try and draw
out your classmates.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.870
Now, you'll get their
one-pagers, their reading

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.250
summaries, in advance.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.100
They'll get you get you
those the day in advance.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.350
I'll get a copy, too.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.350
So I'm going to set up a
rough discussion leader

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.880
agenda for the
first few classes,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.213
and then we'll formalize
it for the whole class.

00:06:58.213 --> 00:07:00.380
But all of you will be
discussion leaders, probably,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.020
at least a couple of times.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.983
But again, it's very
relaxed, it's very informal.

00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:08.150
And we're just going to be
sitting around the table,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.030
and I want you to
kind of really work

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.260
to bring your classmates
into the talking.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.710
So questions about this?

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.920
Let me talk about where
this class is going to go,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.250
so you get a sense of the
pieces that lie ahead.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.110
So the first couple of classes
are really introductory.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.510
And today's class,
as those of you

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.430
who were able to
get to the site saw,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.510
is really about economic growth
theory, so innovation growth

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.630
theory.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.840
And that's foundational.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.650
In other words, what
are the pillars on which

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.240
studying innovation rests?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.250
Clearly, the economic
justification

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.640
is one of the absolute central
and probably the critical one.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.980
So what does innovation
growth policy--

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.890
how does it think,
how is it organized?

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:13.070
And we're going to be reading
two very famous growth

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.830
economists and
talking about that--

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.470
three, actually,
and kind of trying

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.990
to put together the
basics of growth theory

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.850
so that we understand
that and can use that.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:32.090
And the second class moves
into kind of a second part

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.710
of growth theory.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.799
And we could call this
innovation systems.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:44.768
In other words, innovation
occurs in a system,

00:08:44.768 --> 00:08:47.060
and you have to understand
the elements in that system.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.768
So we're going to talk
about that systems

00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:52.000
approach in next week's class.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.580
And then I'll give you two
kind of key tools to work with.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.260
In other words, based on
the first couple of classes,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.390
you're going to be able to look
at another country, at a state,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.460
at a region, and
you're going to be

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:13.985
able to see how you can evaluate
that area's innovation system.

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:15.610
What are the factors
that you look for,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.443
what are the capabilities
that you look for,

00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:19.240
how do you assess
them, and then,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.550
in particular, at the
end of next week's class,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.620
how do you look at
them as a system?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.650
And then we'll take
that framework and we're

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.250
going to apply that framework
and add pieces to it--

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.640
to the rest of the class.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.820
So the next two classes are
really about manufacturing.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.810
So just in case you got
the idea that this is just

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.620
policy esoterica, we're going
to have a very real dive

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.590
into some very real
problems that are, frankly,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.460
at the heart of the
political disruption that's

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.740
going on now in the United
States and elsewhere.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.070
So we're going to do
two classes on that.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.890
So a deep, very
practical, very real

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.910
dive into a really
important and very current

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.570
innovation system problem.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:14.200
And then we're going
to go back and pick up

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.200
some pieces we started with
the first couple of classes.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.370
So we're going to look
hard at the US innovation

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.930
system, particularly the
federal pieces of it--

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.220
the federal R&D agencies
and organizations

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.080
that are part of US
innovation system.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.880
AUDIENCE: What is R&D?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.010
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Research and development.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.190
Don't hesitate to ask
questions, by the way.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.620
Please bring those forward.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.460
So we'll look at the research
and development system--

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.022
[TRYING TO PRONOUNCE STUDENT'S
 NAME]

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.390
AUDIENCE: You can call me Steph.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.473
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Steph?

00:10:50.473 --> 00:10:51.820
That is easier, OK.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.370
Thanks, Steph.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.290
And where did it
come from, how does

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.550
it think, how is it organized,
what are its origins.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.558
Because we're at MIT, I'll give
you a lot of insider MIT stuff.

00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:07.850
Because MIT historically was
involved in a lot of this.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.660
So you'll collect
some good MIT stories,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.910
I hope, particularly
in that class.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.610
But you know, MIT greats
like Vannevar Bush

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:20.678
and Alfred Loomis will
come up in that class.

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.220
Then, in the sixth
class, we're going

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.480
to talk about the major policy
focus in science and technology

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.820
policy, which is called
the valley of death--

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.700
how do you get from
the research side

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.700
over to later-stage development.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.220
And that's been the major policy
emphasis in the US system.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.000
There's a big chasm
there, a valley.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.040
Building the bridging
mechanisms across

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.550
has been a big
policy preoccupation.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.040
So we'll dive into
that literature.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.980
And we will also
look at the fact

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.870
that the United States actually
runs two innovation systems.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.940
So we run the innovation system.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.980
Probably most of you
are familiar with places

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.340
like NSF, the Office of
Science at the Department

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.130
of Energy, NIH.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.870
So that's the kind
of civilian side,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.780
but then there's a whole
defense innovation system that

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.420
is organized very differently.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.610
Lily is nodding her head,
because we spent time

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.200
on this in the first class.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.940
So we'll talk about
that system, too,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.950
and kind of how that works.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.090
And then, up until
class 7, we've

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.060
been talking about
innovation as though it

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.270
has to do with institutions.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.830
But people innovate,
not institutions.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.680
So innovation is
owned by people.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.190
It occurs in a very
face-to-face environment.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.890
You can't just
understand innovation

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.640
by understanding the
institutions that are

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.410
sticking their hands into it.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.930
In the end, it's
a people system.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.640
And how do people--

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.690
what does innovation look like
when people are running it

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.940
at the face-to-face level?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.910
And it turns out there's
literature on this.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.770
There are some rules
that innovation groups

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.738
tend to follow when
they're undertaking

00:13:08.738 --> 00:13:10.780
their process of trying
to get to a breakthrough.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.690
So we'll look at the
organization of innovation

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.210
systems at the face-to-face
level as well as

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.710
the institutional level.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.380
And that class, you all
will own, because I'm

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.970
going to have you all present--

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.590
a whole group of you--

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.390
on great innovation groups.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.870
And then we've got the
foundations of set,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.740
and we're going to start to
look at particular segments.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.850
So we'll take a deep dive into
DARPA, the Defense Advanced

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.980
Research Agency, and
its innovation model.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.110
So that'll be kind
of a case study.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:54.150
We're going to take a close
look at energy technology.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.180
And here, Martha will help
us get through the class,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.540
because she'll know
much more than me.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.020
And we're going to look very
closely at the life science

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.030
innovation system that,
on the federal side,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.970
is led by the National
Institutes of Health,

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.240
and some of the big
challenges in that system.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.110
We're going to
develop an idea of how

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.410
do legacy sectors innovate.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.990
Because the computing
revolution was

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.510
brought about by a new
frontier-- creating

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.120
a new frontier territory
and innovation.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.850
But most of the
economy-- more than 80%--

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.160
is owned by these
established sectors.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.920
And it's much harder to bring
innovation into those sectors.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.390
So energy is like the poster
child for that problem,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.810
and we'll take a
real look at that.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.310
And then, at the
close of the class,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.935
we're going to do a
couple of, I think,

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:49.230
more fun and interesting
out-of-the-blue categories.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.310
So we're going to look at
the talent base, and science

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.120
and technology education, and
all the challenges embedded

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.100
in developing a strong
S&T talent base.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.560
And then we're going to
take a look at what we

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.180
could call the future of work.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.230
So are you going
to have any jobs?

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.670
Are you going to be displaced
by MIT-developed robotics?

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.780
You aren't, don't worry.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.640
But that'll be one
of the challenges

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.835
that we're going to look at.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.210
AUDIENCE: Is the
future of work--

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.960
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Now, tell me your name

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.076
so I get to know everybody.

00:15:26.076 --> 00:15:27.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.229
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK, Martine.

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:31.771
AUDIENCE: So is the future of
work based on Tom Malone's work

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:34.180
at Sloan?

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
We'll look at--

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.930
I tell you who we'll look at.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.610
We'll look at the kind of
techno-dystopia movement, which

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.080
Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee at Sloan

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.290
have been doing
a lot of work on.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:55.060
And IT is going to replace
a lot of work theory.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.760
We're going to look
at David Autor, who's

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.590
a wonderful MIT economist.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.500
And we'll read several
things from David.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.390
But he's looking at all kinds
of economic effects on job

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.200
creation, including
from manufacturing.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.410
And we're going to look
at some studies that

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.990
try to take a deep dive into
how much work is actually

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.410
going to be displaced.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.580
And there's a fairly
interesting new OECD study

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.250
that came out this
summer that indicates

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.290
it's not going to be that bad.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.477
So we're going to look at
all these kinds of issues,

00:16:31.477 --> 00:16:32.560
and kind of play them out.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.020
But I think it will be
particularly interesting,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.570
and a kind of
challenging session.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.670
One more thing we'll
do is, David Mindell,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:48.850
who teaches at STS, who is a
wonderful technology historian

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.910
but also a terrific engineer.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.560
So David is on leave
from MIT this semester

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.460
because he's doing
his robotics startup.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.980
But he has a book called
Our Robots, Ourselves.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.180
And he takes a really deep look.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.140
If robotics, in a way, is
the most threatening entry

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.680
to human work, what does
that actually look like?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.810
What is actually going on?

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.460
And he comes up
with a thesis that's

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.180
much more about assistive
robotics and cobotics

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.650
than about people displacement.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.720
So we'll look at all this
stuff, and try and lay it out.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.460
Anything so far--
questions so far?

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.060
AUDIENCE: Will we
also be talking

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.680
about economic competitiveness
re international relations

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.538
for example,
manufacturing in China?

00:17:39.538 --> 00:17:40.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.430
So we're going to do snapshots
on international issues

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.340
kind of throughout.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.820
So the basic focus
will be in the US.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.140
But Matt, coming back
to your question,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.820
there'll be a lot of underlying
questions about how economic

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.630
growth--

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.450
innovation-based growth
works that's going

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.470
to have a lot more
applicability worldwide,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.150
including the developed
and developing world.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.420
So you're going to
get a toolset that

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.520
will enable you to look at
innovation much more broadly

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.270
than just the US.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.478
You're going to pick up a
lot of pieces about the US,

00:18:13.478 --> 00:18:15.960
but it's a much broader
toolset than that, which I

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.210
think you'll be able to apply.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.000
And we'll have a number of
readings that will pull us

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.850
into the international issues.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.141
What else?

00:18:26.141 --> 00:18:28.266
AUDIENCE: Are you going to
have any current events,

00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:30.651
especially during
this [INAUDIBLE]??

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.082
[CHUCKLING]

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.585
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm
always open to current events.

00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:37.960
When we talk about
manufacturing,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.500
I'll try and give you a
backdrop on some of that.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.770
So that's the third class.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:49.810
And you know, it's been a lot
of social disruption in the US.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.517
And we'll try,
through a reading by--

00:18:52.517 --> 00:18:54.100
we'll talk about
David Autor, and some

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.036
of his work and findings
in that area in particular.

00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.600
And there'll be a lot of stories
developing as the year goes on,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.100
I know.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.980
Anything else to start?

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.292
AUDIENCE: Yeah, question.

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:13.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Rasheed, right?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.120
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Good.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.245
AUDIENCE: So when we go
through innovation systems,

00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:19.022
are we going to talk
about methods or ways

00:19:19.022 --> 00:19:21.480
to kind of change and alter
them, or are we just going to--

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.022
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You bet, you bet.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.710
None of this stuff
is locked in stone.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.712
You know, I hope all
of you will do startups

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:31.920
at some point in your career.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.490
I hope all of you will be
involved in innovation policy

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.658
and issues.

00:19:37.658 --> 00:19:39.200
And part of the tool
set you're going

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.940
to get is how to think about
those innovation systems

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.620
and how to think
about organizing them

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.720
in an optimal way.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.970
If anything, that's
the key thing

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.480
I want to convey in this
course, so that when

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.590
you're running this
country, you've

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.100
got an agenda ready to go.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.030
Anything else?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.310
All right, so I'm going to do
more talking in this class.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.460
I'll do less talking
in future classes.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.645
Hold me to that.

00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:12.270
But let me kind of
summarize what we're

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.520
going to see in today's class.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.690
So we're going to talk
about Robert Solow.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.880
And his contribution is to
think about a critical factor

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.130
in innovation, a
direct innovation

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.040
factor, which he refers to
as technological and related

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.360
innovation.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.530
So that's a term that I
want you all to recall--

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.633
technological and
related innovation.

00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:39.300
We're going to use
that a lot, and we'll

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.300
talk in a minute
about what it means.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.592
And then we're going to talk
about another great growth

00:20:43.592 --> 00:20:47.220
economist, Paul Romer.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.610
He was in MIT for about
a year, and then ran out.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.540
He's a character.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.190
And we'll talk about him, too.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.560
But he comes up with our
second direct innovation

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.480
factor, human capital
engaged in research.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.580
And we'll talk about
what that means.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.110
And then, third, do these
factors actually make sense?

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.880
So Dale Jorgenson is a Harvard
economics professor of note,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.280
another great growth economist.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.010
And he takes a deep dive
into the IT revolution

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.060
of the '90s and the
period leading up to that,

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.790
and he essentially
concludes, yeah, this

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.140
was technologically-driven,
innovation-based growth.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.380
It drove a huge
growth in the economy.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.640
And then we'll have fun with a
little study by Merrill Lynch,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.910
which is an investors'
look at innovation,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:42.640
and how do investors think
about investing in innovation.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.360
And then we'll look at some--

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.930
I asked you all to
look at NSF indicators.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.510
I'll explain what
that is in a bit.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.220
But we'll look at some ways
of looking at those two

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.410
basic innovation factors--

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:04.120
the technology R&D
factor, the talent factor,

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:10.210
and if you look at those, what
do those look like in the US?

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:17.020
So part 1 here is the kind
of fundamental factors

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.340
of innovation.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.070
But let me get some
general terms on the table.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.170
And I will post, by
the way, the lectures,

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.800
after, on the stellar website,
so you all have access to them.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.200
But there's some terms
that will recur here.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.330
And you don't need
to memorize them now,

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.980
but they'll be posted
today or tomorrow.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:48.190
So science-- science evolved
as a way of understanding

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.950
the natural world.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.220
It came out of
natural philosophy.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.410
It's an 18th/19th century
kind of conceptual framework.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.400
It is observational at heart.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.250
It observes the natural
world, and attempts

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.580
to understand how
it's put together.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.070
And it's organized
around discovery

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.010
about that natural
world and its order.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.100
Technology is really different.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.340
It is a system to organize
scientific and technical

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.920
knowledge to go after a
more practical purpose.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.987
And this systems includes the
technical advance plus models

00:23:28.987 --> 00:23:30.070
to implement that advance.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.760
So you move from observation
to implementation.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.980
And this is, obviously,
the historical boundary

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.580
between science and engineering.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:48.580
And research-- another
term we'll use constantly--

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:56.720
means increasing the scientific
or technical knowledge or both.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.850
So research can pursue either
of these historic ends, or both

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.100
simultaneously.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.230
Invention is about applying
research knowledge to create

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.880
a practical idea or device.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.150
Invention is really
different than innovation.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.330
Innovation is built on
scientific discovery

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:27.040
and on breakthrough
invention or inventions,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.330
but it is the system of research
invention development that

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.630
uses both scientific
background, scientific knowledge

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.260
and technology knowledge to
lead to the implementation

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:44.470
and widespread applicability
of a technology area.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.580
So typically, in our society,
that means commercialization.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.150
So this class is about this.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.550
That's the stage
we're most focused on.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.390
But remember all the input
above that that goes into this.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.640
Now, an innovation system--
we talked about this briefly

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.720
before--

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.270
is the ecosystem for
developing innovation.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:12.250
And as we discussed, briefly,
it operates at least two levels.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.010
It operates at the
institutional level

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.880
of supporting the development
of the inventions and discovery

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.550
that go into
innovation, but it also

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.060
operates at the personal,
face-to-face level.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.610
Because in the end, people--

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.905
you all-- innovate, not
some fancy institution.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.880
Innovation wave
theory-- in economics,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.430
this is called
Kondratiev theory.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:48.180
And we'll talk more about
this as the class goes on.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.220
But let me just give kind
of a snapshot of what

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.380
I'm talking about.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.390
Innovation tends
to come in a wave.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.000
And in your lifetime,
the big wave

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.390
has been the IT revolution.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.260
If we were born
in 1800, railroads

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.510
would be like a big
innovation wave.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.150
Early telegraph-based
communication

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.490
would be a big innovation wave.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.120
Electricity would be
a big innovation wave.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.900
And you tend to have a
core technology advance,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.960
you pile on applications,
and it begins

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.277
to move through
an entire society

00:26:24.277 --> 00:26:25.485
and affect the whole society.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.440
And to some extent,
the technology

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.930
drives the nature
of the society.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.550
So that's what
Karl Marx believed.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.180
That's called determinism,
that the technology

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.790
plays a deterministic role in
the organization of society.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.630
So it's big.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.770
It is very big.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.758
It's not just a pile of
new technology stuff,

00:26:48.758 --> 00:26:51.300
and it's fundamentally changing
the way in which this society

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.200
is organized as well.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.320
So that's also part of
these innovation waves.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.540
So a wave hits an
economy, takes a long time

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.540
to grow, eventually
it scales up,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.130
and affects a good part of
the economy at any given time.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.130
Eventually, you run out
of the technology menu,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.440
and it stabilizes.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.960
But it doesn't disappear,
it creates a new plateau

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.310
in your economy.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.070
And then you do another wave.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.570
Yeah.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.387
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
by run out of the technology?

00:27:24.387 --> 00:27:26.970
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me see
if there's-- is there any chalk

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.010
down at that end, Martha?

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.720
I don't see any.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.750
It's all right.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.470
Oh, there is?

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.010
MARTHA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.093
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Great.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.955
We'll come back to this, but
it's an important enough idea.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:53.520
So there's a slow build-up, and
then there's a rapid build-up.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.730
Then there's a bubble.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.450
Then there's slower scaling.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.910
And then, eventually, you
reach technological maturity--

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.230
sort of three scales.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.770
This is where the bubble is.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.260
So the IT wave, right?

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.690
Somebody-- I don't
know where this starts.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.150
Maybe it starts with
Babbage in the 19th century.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.980
But let's start it
with the ENIAC computer

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.290
at the end of World War II.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.480
1945, 46, right?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.820
Slow scale up.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.610
Then you hit 1990s.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.010
And then you have very
rapid scale up, right?

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.920
And you probably had some sense
for what that era was like.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.720
But it was a period of
remarkably big growth rise,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.010
big increase in GDP growth
rate, accompanied and driven

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.980
by a big gain in productivity.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.710
We'll come back to that
term in a bit, too.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.290
Then there's always
a bubble, right?

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.630
So if you all are investing
in innovation waves--

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.130
if you go into the
financial sector,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.838
and you're investing
in innovation waves,

00:28:57.838 --> 00:28:59.280
trying to ride them--

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.860
you want to start about
here, ride it all the way up.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.740
But never forget that
there's going to be a bubble.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.300
There is always a bubble.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.170
In every innovation wave so far,
there's always been a bubble.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.440
So in the IT revolution,
that was the dot com bust

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.630
of 2001, right?

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:21.030
And then, we're in a long period
of continued technological

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:26.265
advance, but not at the rate
of the 1990s growth period.

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.140
And you can think about
different generations

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.220
of companies that come along
and play different roles here.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.950
And then, at someday--

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.983
and IT may be different--

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:37.650
but someday we'll
reach a certain amount

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.240
of technological maturity.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.710
And the growth rate
will stabilize.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.220
And then we'll do
something else, right?

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.960
So that's kind of what
a wave looks like.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.850
And again, you build
into your economy

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:54.370
a series of mesas or plateaus,
which don't disappear.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.240
You just go on to the
next innovation wave.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.070
This is the way economies grow,
through these innovation lives.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.360
So it's a pretty
important concept.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.080
And if you can get
your technology advance

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.410
into an innovation
wave, then it kind of

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.100
goes on autopilot, right?

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.600
And all these things
start to occur.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.800
So that's what we're desperately
trying to do for energy.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.050
We're trying to get
it scaled up enough

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.720
so that it can take
off, go on autopilot,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.620
and just kind of happen.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.280
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
there is a bubble present.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.168
[INAUDIBLE] wouldn't that
affect [INAUDIBLE] this growth?

00:30:35.168 --> 00:30:36.210
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:41.520
It wipes out lots of the
dot com startups, right?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.210
They die.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.580
And only the stronger companies
with more solid enduring models

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.200
survive.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.450
So always anticipate the bubble.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.430
And get out in time.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.445
That's the key.

00:30:55.445 --> 00:30:57.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] have
a different perspective,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.070
they see it as two bumps.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.780
They see it as one
baby bump, and then

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.520
a huge bump So for
the 90s, it was,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.650
like, it would cost you
like $70,000 to buy servers.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.280
So those businesses took
a lot of capital to start.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.078
And so people get
really, really excited.

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.870
And so they start to
invest a lot of money.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.370
And then they expect the bubble.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.960
And then, no one
wants to invest.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.290
Because there is just a bubble.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.460
And then, people keep
innovating in the technology

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.460
until it's perfected.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.400
So an example of that is, like,
once we had the mobile phone,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.710
in 2010, then you're going
to have a lot of apps

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.830
and have a lot of
disruptive innovation.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.190
So VCs usually just
look at it as two bumps.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.460
But the second bump is usually
just massive [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:33.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, and you

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.950
can look at this as
a couple of bumps,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.270
but not quite in
the way, Martine,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.228
that you're describing.

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:41.820
But you could look at this
rise and then this phase.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.892
It's kind of two
different pieces, too.

00:31:43.892 --> 00:31:45.600
So that's another way
of looking at this.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.420
Rapid growth, more stable
growth, with different firms

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.420
typically involved in the two.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.060
We're going to dig into this.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.050
But go ahead.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.467
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to ask,

00:31:56.467 --> 00:31:59.152
what are the key indicators
that a bubble is--

00:31:59.152 --> 00:32:01.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You're
getting rich, right?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.390
A lot of people are
getting rich, right?

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.670
That's the key indicator.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:10.560
In the IT revolution,
everybody got a lot better off.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.840
So all quintiles of
the society ended up

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.348
with a significant gain.

00:32:17.348 --> 00:32:19.140
You know, the upper
middle class, as usual,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.640
gets the biggest gain.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.890
But everybody went up
in that time period.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.130
I'm stealing my own thunder
from later in the class.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.830
But actually, we'll
deal with some of this

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.660
when we talk about Jorgenson.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.770
We'll get into productivity
and GDP growth.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.350
So make me come back to this.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.820
All right.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.237
So we got through
innovation ways,

00:32:44.237 --> 00:32:45.880
more or less, with more to come.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.540
And then we talked earlier about
this Valley of Death concept,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.080
right-- the gap between research
and later stage development

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.540
that has been the main
focus of public policy

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.113
in the innovation field.

00:32:58.113 --> 00:32:59.530
One of the things
about this class

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.030
is that you're going
to realize this

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.145
is only one part of a much more
complicated and richer story.

00:33:04.145 --> 00:33:06.520
So we're going to be telling
a lot of stories in addition

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.110
to this story.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.240
But that's one of the
stories we're going to tell.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.025
So any further
questions about this?

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.180
I just wanted to get some
basic vocabulary kind of out

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:19.810
on the table.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.560
Let me say a few more
introductory things.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.740
The relationship between
science and technology--

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.870
really, before the
mid-19th century,

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:34.280
technology wasn't
really based on science.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.670
It was based, in a
way, on tinkering.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.680
And that's not to say
that science didn't

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.540
enter at some critical stages.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.140
It does.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.820
But the initial
invention moments

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.390
are technology types
fiddling around

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.880
in the 19th century and late
18th century-- the equivalent

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.400
of a garage, right?

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.470
So science is not
far enough along

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.040
to be able to give
birth to technology,

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.320
for at least a large
part of the 19th century.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.320
But now we're in an era where
basic science definitely

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.060
can give rise to technology.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.560
Now somebody-- a friend
I know pretty well,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.870
named Lee Buchanan, who is
a former deputy director

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.610
of DARPA--

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:30.230
would always insist that,
yeah, that's all fine.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.409
But I'm running DARPA.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.280
And I get nothing
out of basic science.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.280
I could drop all that
funding and never miss it,

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.120
he explained to me one day.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.600
So I think he's wrong.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.920
But you should know there's
a debate about this,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.199
including in our most famous
advanced technology agency.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.000
But I think, in the
end, the evidence

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.929
is strong that science can
now give rise to technology.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:58.655
But keep in mind that technology
still gives rise to science.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.340
And we'll talk about
what that means in a bit.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.750
Now here's our first MIT great.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.630
Forgive the
MIT-centric focus here,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.680
for our colleagues from
other institutions.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.650
You'll have to bear with me.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.240
Robert Solow won the Nobel
Prize in economics in 1987

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.580
for, essentially,
developing growth economics.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.130
I mean, he created an
entire field of economics.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:35.600
And he's just a
wonderful human being.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.715
He's still around.

00:35:36.715 --> 00:35:40.370
If you ever get a chance to
meet him or listen to him,

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.060
don't miss it.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.840
He's one of the greats.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.460
Forget the Nobel Prize.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.590
The really important prize
is the President's Medal

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.230
of Technology, right?

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.230
The only economist who's ever
won the President's Medal

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.890
of Technology.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.500
There he is getting
it from Clinton.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.790
It's really unusual.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.030
His work is so important in
its implications for technology

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.180
development that he gets
the technology prize, too,

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.387
from the president.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.990
I can't tell you what
a nice person he is.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.540
I once watched him testify
in front of the House Science

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.500
Committee.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.570
And it was like, you know,
God has entered the room.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.300
Solow has come into the room.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.140
And the committee all knew that
innovation based growth theory

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.910
comes from this guy.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.540
And they were just
incredibly complimentary.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.420
And the congresswoman
who was, like,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.170
the number two or three
on the committee--

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.860
so her questioning
was fairly early--

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.730
and she turned to
him and said, you

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.480
know, doctor, you know, for
the purpose of this hearing,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.540
you know, what should
we call you, Nobleist?

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.140
You know, what term
should we use for you?

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.460
And he kind of leans back.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:03.740
And he says, well, you know, I
was a tech sergeant in the army

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.480
and during the Korean War.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.190
And I really came to
like the title Sarge.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.500
So maybe you could
call me Sarge.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:18.710
And there's this fancy
congressional committee

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:23.420
calling Robert Solow, Sarge,
for the rest of the hearing.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.920
He had them eating
out of his hands.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.310
He was just funny and charming
and incredibly thoughtful,

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.330
all at the same time.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.890
So he's quite an amazing figure.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.020
He wins the Nobel Prize
for essentially blowing up

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.470
a large part of
classical economics.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.930
And the problem with
classical economics--

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.560
and look, I asked
you to read this.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.910
And it's his Nobel Prize talk.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.730
So for economics writing,
it's fairly accessible.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.893
But even then, it's not simple.

00:37:57.893 --> 00:37:59.310
If you're going
to be reading it--

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.470
and I'm going to ask everybody
who hasn't done the readings

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:04.050
yet for this class, because I
know it's your first time with

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.360
access to the Stellar site--

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.110
but just blow by the
economics formulation period.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.670
Just blow by the econometrics.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.895
Just get the basic ideas down
for both Solow and for Romer,

00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:15.540
in particular.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.060
The Romer one is particularly
complicated reading,

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.570
for those of you who've
not studied economics.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.390
But he goes after
classical economic theory.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.300
And just to summarize,
in a simpler way

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.820
than is really fair to
classical economics,

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.700
classical economics
asked when an economy

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.030
is capable of steady
economic growth.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.360
And they never came
up with a good answer.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.910
The formulation was when the
national savings rate, which

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.160
means income saved
in the economy,

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.810
equals the capital supply,
capital output ratio,

00:38:54.810 --> 00:39:00.030
and the rate of labor force
growth, that's labor supply,

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.170
then you get growth.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.990
That was the theory, all right?

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.540
So let me simplify
that even more.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.330
Essentially, you've
got two factors.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.790
Capital supply and labor supply.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.220
And it's not capital
supply, like, all the money.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.420
It's capitals like
plant equipment,

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.890
as well as resources,
that's available.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.250
And labor supply includes not
just the number of workers,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.490
but education health
systems and the supporting

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.510
systems for that, too.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.700
So these are bigger concepts.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.550
So essentially, their
theory was that these

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.800
are the contributing factors,
capital supply and labor

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.570
supply.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:41.610
And when you get those in
the right balance, supported

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:45.390
by your national saving
rate, which is essentially

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.730
the funder of those
systems, then you

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:48.960
will get economic growth.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.900
It's a static view.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.840
It's an equilibrium system.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.490
And these factors have to
be in the right balance--

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:06.420
they constantly tend to
throw each other off--

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.630
for growth to occur.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.628
So you explain a
business cycle from this.

00:40:11.628 --> 00:40:12.420
I mean, not really.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.240
But that's what
it attempts to do.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.400
And capitalism
becomes just periods

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.860
of alternating improvement
and gain and decline.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.770
So it's a business cycle
kind of explanation.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:29.100
Worsening unemployment and
then labor shortages, right?

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.010
Everything is throwing
each other, over time,

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.510
out of balance.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.935
It is not a dynamic model.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.160
I should explain that classical
economics basically starts

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.230
with Adam Smith and
lasts until, really,

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.170
the post World War II period.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.830
And the problem
with economics that

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.230
was so frustrating to
economists, as well

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:04.290
as policymakers, was
that it didn't really

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:08.040
have a foundational set
of operating and working

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.420
assumptions that were reliable.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.810
It didn't have a reliable base.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:15.480
So if you had 15 of you
were economists sitting

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.560
around trying to explain
to me, a policymaker,

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.590
how come there was
a Great Depression,

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.740
you would have at least 30
ideas on the table, right?

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.052
It wasn't really
terribly helpful to me.

00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:31.510
There were just
too many variables.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.410
So social science, in the
course of World War II,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.180
saw what physics did--

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.370
staring at our two
physics guys here.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:46.210
Well, there's more--
several physics books.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:51.280
Physics, in that pre
World War II period,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.260
attempts to get down to
basic known scientifically

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.882
established currents
of fact that

00:42:00.882 --> 00:42:02.090
can be demonstrated and known

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:05.052
So that's the whole particle
physics endeavor, right?

00:42:05.052 --> 00:42:06.760
We're going to weed
out extraneous stuff,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.550
get down to a fairly
small subset of stuff

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.710
that we really
know, and then work

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.690
with those as building blocks.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.570
So all of the social
sciences watch

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.242
what happens to physics in
that pre World War II period,

00:42:20.242 --> 00:42:21.700
and that World War
II period, where

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.257
eventually things like nuclear
weapons and power come about.

00:42:25.257 --> 00:42:27.340
And they think, gee, maybe
they're onto something.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.530
Maybe that's a practice
that we ought to do.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:37.020
Can we get down to a relatively
small number of known variables

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.130
and, in effect, create
a known system here

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.600
that's much more reliable
than the kind of pre World War

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.077
II guesswork in economics--

00:42:44.077 --> 00:42:46.660
that everybody would be working
from a similar kind of problem

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.710
set?

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.200
So that's the enterprise.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.230
Solow is a
neoclassical economist.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.350
So he's post
classical economics.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.130
He's part of a movement,
which Paul Samuelson, here,

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:06.340
is one of the tiny handful
of the great leaders of that

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.320
tries to get economics down
to a subset of known factors

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.070
and known realities that can be
demonstrated and mathematically

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:16.580
proven.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.060
So that's what neoclassical
economics is up against.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.490
That's what they're
trying to do.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.500
Solow is a
neoclassical economist.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.800
And he is working through
this problem of growth.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.180
So he had, what, 150, 200
years worth of economics?

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.460
And they didn't have a
viable growth theory.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.070
I mean, what's with this?

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.610
So, fortunately,
Solow comes along.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:39.550
And he forms one.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:44.170
And he said the story told by
these classical models felt

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.420
wrong.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.140
And he noted that in one of the
classical economists, Harrod,

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.880
there was a hint
and generalizations

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.920
about entrepreneurial behavior.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.830
And he decided
that he could think

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:03.430
about replacing the
capital and labor

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.090
output with a richer
and more realistic

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.770
representation of
technology, which

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.480
would be a new
theory of production,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.550
not just an assessment
of output levels.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.820
That's the key
thought pattern here.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.160
So it's not that capital
supply and labor supply

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.320
aren't important, right?

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.750
They remain important factors.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:34.660
But they are not close to
as important as this more

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.540
realistic representation of
technology, which he also

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.850
calls, as I said earlier,
technological and related

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:41.350
innovation.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.770
So it's not just the
technology, right?

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.110
It includes that bundle of
stuff around the technology,

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.510
like process and business
models that enable it.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:57.430
But in the end, it's
technology-based innovation

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.870
that becomes the heart
of economic growth.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.900
And Solow does a 50 year
review of the US economy.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:12.330
And he concludes that in
that 50 year time period,

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.960
technological and
related innovation

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.800
is the dominant causative
factor of US economic growth

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.420
to the tune of about 2/3.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:26.960
So in that range, somewhere
between 50% and higher.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.550
We may be on the
higher end of that,

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.300
now, in this era
that we're in now.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.510
And that's his key breakthrough.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:40.275
So capital supply and labor
supply are significant.

00:45:40.275 --> 00:45:41.525
But they're down in the teens.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.290
Now he acknowledges
that the rate of growth

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.575
is going to depend upon
the investment rate.

00:45:49.575 --> 00:45:51.700
Because that will be a
factor that helps drives it.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.650
So capital supply here
is still significant.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:46:00.880
But old growth theory, classical
growth theory, is mechanical.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.067
It is an equilibrium system.

00:46:02.067 --> 00:46:04.150
It's constantly going in
and out of balance, hence

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.200
those business cycles.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.550
The great thing about
what Solow comes up with

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:14.347
is that he brings
a dynamic factor

00:46:14.347 --> 00:46:15.430
into understanding growth.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.400
I'll skip some of this.

00:46:29.804 --> 00:46:33.880
This can be very good news, OK?

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.980
So economics goes from like this
kind of dark and dismal science

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:44.350
to a way in which a society
can grow and increase

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:48.730
its well-being by introducing
more technological and related

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.900
innovation.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.050
That's profoundly good news.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.630
It gets us out of this
old equilibrium system,

00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:02.060
this old dismal science on to
what, if you can get it going,

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:08.050
what can be a dynamic
pattern, and improve

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:09.970
societal well-being.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.795
We can see these
technological innovations

00:47:12.795 --> 00:47:14.920
in the way they changed
society in the past, right?

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.458
So we think about what the
19th century looks like.

00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:19.000
And I mentioned some
of these before.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.540
But you know, canals and
railroads and electricity

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.220
and the telegraph
and the telephone,

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.190
and more recent times, aerospace
and computing and the internet,

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.420
these are all growth
transformers, right?

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.180
And you've seen a
couple of these.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.640
You've seen the IT
revolution in your lifetime.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.820
And you've seen, on a smaller
scale, but still significant,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.800
biotech revolution, both of
which are still playing out.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.500
So you can get a feel for
what these things look like.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.630
We kind of know they're real.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.150
This is not just
some Solow construct.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.620
We feel these.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.240
Because we see them around us.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.310
So what's the pattern?

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.430
So there's a core
technology advance.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.150
That yields opportunities
for new applications

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.840
which can pile on to that
core technology advance.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.530
And then that, in turn, can
become big enough that it

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.740
enters society at scale, right?

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.420
And we also the IT revolution
spreading into different parts

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.820
of the economy.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.400
And then that can yield
productivity gains.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.120
So productivity gains,
for you non-economists,

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.620
are when you're producing
more with less labor input--

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.230
so more for less, right?

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.780
Workers spend less time
on the production stage.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.393
And they produce more, right?

00:48:36.393 --> 00:48:37.810
So those are the
efficiencies that

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.220
come out of technology, enable
these productivity gains.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:46.600
The productivity gains-- that
is a real gain in this society.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.870
That creates real wealth.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.250
Because you're producing
more with less.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.740
So there's a real gain.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.560
And then, depending on how
your society is organized,

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.020
you can distribute that wealth.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.660
And the society can move ahead.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.930
So that's what we saw happening
in that amazing 1990s period,

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:06.430
right?

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.763
And we'll talk about Jorgensen
and the pictures of that,

00:49:08.763 --> 00:49:10.330
in a minute.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.862
Follow me?

00:49:11.862 --> 00:49:12.794
Are you with me?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.570
So, great.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.220
We're out of dismal science.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.500
There's really good news here.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.310
You can do this innovation
stuff, and grow your society,

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.190
grow your economy, and grow
societal well-being, right?

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:31.380
That's the good news.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.838
The bad news is how the
heck do you do that?

00:49:36.838 --> 00:49:37.630
How do you do that?

00:49:40.807 --> 00:49:42.390
And that's what this
course is about--

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.182
how do you do that?

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:51.030
For a long time,
economists thought

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.440
that this technological
and related innovation

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.220
stuff was the way in which
rich nations got much richer.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.500
And that's pretty much
the way it looked,

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.990
for a long period of time.

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:07.530
But then, funny things
started happening, right?

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.410
Countries like Korea, Taiwan.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.860
But then, really
importantly, India and China

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:19.170
hit on aspects of a
technological based innovation

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:23.610
model and began to significantly
grow the middle classes

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.580
in their societies.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.960
So we now know
this is not only--

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.670
Matt, this is for you--

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.990
this is not only a model
for developed countries,

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:36.900
this is a developing
country model, too.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.670
This is really important, right?

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:50.110
So technological
progress is key.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:54.520
Capital is a supporting role,
but still important, right?

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.620
Labor supply is a supporting
role, but still important.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:05.740
And Solow brings us this
whole new set of ideas.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.090
But then he runs into a problem.

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:09.700
Because remember, he's a
neoclassical economist.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.190
He wants to get down to a
small number of variables

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:15.460
that you really know, right?

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:20.410
Good luck with trying to
understand an innovation system

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:24.340
based upon mathematically proven
small numbers of variables.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:28.210
It is much too rich
and complex a system.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.280
You can't put an
innovation system

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.200
into supply and demand curves.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.690
So Solow sees the power
of technological advance.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:42.080
But he doesn't see
how to measure it.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:49.000
So he can't put it into his
neoclassical economic model.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.650
So he treats technological
innovation as Exogenous--

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:58.600
outside of the economic
analytical modeling

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.020
process that he's involved in.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.320
That's pretty amazing,
when you think about it.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.990
This guy figures out the
dominant causative factor

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.640
of growth, which
is, needless to say,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.550
a pretty important
thing in economics.

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.070
And then he can't
play with it, right?

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.190
Because it's outside his system.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:25.130
So that brings us
to this character.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:28.360
And this is Paul Romer.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:34.900
And you can see, you know,
very California, right?

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:42.310
And he's got that laid-back kind
of relaxed look in his eyes.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:49.390
And he is a remarkable figure.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.220
He is a maverick
troublemaker, all right?

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.340
You know, I got to know
him by actually working

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.830
on some legislation
with him, back when

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.120
I was working in the Senate.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:09.210
And we knew we needed to improve
the STEM, education science

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:12.210
and technology,
work base that was

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.040
going to be pretty
important for reasons

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.660
I'll explain in a minute.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.180
And how would you
do that, right?

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.890
So I'm a senate staffer.

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.650
I'm thinking, gee,
we're already spending,

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:25.950
you know, X billions of dollars
on fellowships for you guys.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:30.420
And we're going to have to
find billions more and increase

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.915
the number and expand the base.

00:53:31.915 --> 00:53:33.540
And it's going to be
incredibly costly.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.390
And I'll never get this passed.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.175
So Romer is thinking
about all this stuff

00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:40.050
and writing about it.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.440
And we'll read something else
of his late in the class.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.180
But I sat down with him.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.000
And he said, Bill, you're not
thinking about this right.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.310
He said, think
like an economist.

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:57.200
He said, you don't have
to subsidize everything.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.140
You just bribe the gatekeepers.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.580
That was his phrase.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.710
And his point was,
you don't have

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.930
to throw a huge amount
of money and build up

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.060
all kinds of
programmatic elements.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:11.330
You just figure out who's
not doing their job,

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.790
and expanding the number
of scientists and engineers

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:14.990
studying at universities.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.850
And you bribe them
to change their ways.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.560
That's the way you
do it, all right?

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.240
Much cheaper.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.950
And sure enough, we
fashion legislation

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:23.947
and eventually get it passed.

00:54:23.947 --> 00:54:25.530
I'm not sure it
changed all that much.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.010
But it was a fun exercise
working with him.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.560
Because he definitely
has this maverick

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.360
troublemaking perspective.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:39.800
At one point in his
career at Stanford,

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.380
he realizes the
incredible inefficiency

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:47.030
of economics education,
that his students just

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:51.093
aren't getting the big ideas
by listening to lectures

00:54:51.093 --> 00:54:52.010
and reading textbooks.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.350
It's just not happening.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:59.900
So he walks out of Stanford,
and sets up his own economics

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:03.290
textbook company, which
is anti textbook, right,

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.120
and essentially
develops a whole set

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.480
of modules of learning by
doing exercises and problem

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.800
sets and online elements.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.540
And so you don't get
a textbook, yeah.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:15.957
You get something
with a textbook.

00:55:15.957 --> 00:55:17.990
But you get all kinds
of online pieces

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.470
that you do constantly
in getting through this.

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.430
So he completely blew up
the whole economics textbook

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.810
industry and has forced an
absolute fundamental reform.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:30.470
And then he went out and
proved, yes, my new system here

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:32.480
works better than
Paul Samuelson's

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.250
and everybody else's textbooks.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.960
Because people are
absorbing the core

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.570
ideas and be able to work
with it much more efficiently.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.278
It's a whole learning by doing
problem based learning set

00:55:41.278 --> 00:55:42.570
that he brings in to economics.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.590
So you know, he just
walks out of his economics

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:48.710
job at Stanford and does
this for four years.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:51.200
And now he's on the
latest of his exercises,

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.230
which is, he went
to NYU a few years

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:58.130
ago to work on sort of cluster
development theory in cities

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:00.100
and metropolitan
areas and growth.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.130
But then he left that.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.860
So he's now chief economist
for the World Bank.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.920
And look out, right?

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.620
Because there's going to
be trouble ahead here.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.110
He's going to change that
place, I'm confident.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:16.353
But let's talk about the ideas
that he brings to our problem.

00:56:16.353 --> 00:56:18.020
AUDIENCE: When did
he switch over, Bill?

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.398
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:21.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
This past summer.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.510
I think that's when he started.

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:25.010
I haven't seen him
since he started.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.210
But sure enough,
one thing he does,

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:32.660
he writes this attack on
economists saying they're

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:36.650
completely in love with, you
know, metrics and mathematics.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:38.330
And it's not going
to get them anywhere.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.408
These systems are too complex.

00:56:40.408 --> 00:56:42.200
And it's just an assault
on the profession.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.840
Because this is a profession,
like all professions.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.020
It doesn't attack itself, right?

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.550
It's not polite, right?

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:54.140
So Romer just lifts
the veil of trouble.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.010
It's quite a piece.

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.427
It hasn't formally
been published.

00:56:56.427 --> 00:56:58.640
I'm not sure any journal
dares publish it.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.002
But it's definitely
circulating around.

00:57:01.002 --> 00:57:02.210
I'll try and find it for you.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:03.440
Because it's a fun read.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.750
It's really something.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:07.130
Anyway, that's Romer.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:10.310
And Romer is on this project.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:13.092
His famous 1990
piece-- which, frankly,

00:57:13.092 --> 00:57:15.300
probably should win him the
Nobel Prize in economics,

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.200
but he's such a troublemaker
that it probably won't--

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.920
is called Endogenous
technological change.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.640
So he's trying to reverse
Solow's exaggerate

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.340
exogenous change
and make it go back,

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.960
get these ideas
of economic growth

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.420
back into an economics
thinking framework.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.460
That's his project here, right?

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.580
And he starts on this pathway.

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.340
I mean, let me just
summarize the basic points.

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.310
He agrees with
Solow that growth is

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.560
driven by technological change.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.060
And then he argues
that that in turn

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.660
is driven by researchers, who
he describes as economic agents,

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.960
profit maximizing agents.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.210
And then he looks at how
technology isn't really

00:57:56.210 --> 00:58:00.170
a conventional good, in the
normal sense of economic goods,

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.530
but has its own set
of unique properties

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:06.350
that make it really
quite different.

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.150
But most important
for us, he looks

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:12.152
at what he calls Human
Capital Engaged in Research.

00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:13.610
In other words,
you don't just have

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:18.170
to do R&D to loosely
summarize Solow.

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:27.860
You've got to have a
talent base doing that R&D.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.320
This whole project is to
take all these concepts

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:38.500
and move them into an
endogenous theory of growth.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.960
So his growth model
is similar to Solow's.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.460
He's picking up on Solow's work.

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.170
He sees that
technological change

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.350
is the heart of economic
growth, as we've discussed.

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:56.370
He sees that technological
change occurs, in turn,

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:57.870
in a large part
because of people

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.970
responding to market incentives.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:02.790
Again, he's trying to get
this into economic thinking.

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.650
And this technological
knowledge,

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:07.980
which is instructions for
working with materials,

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:13.620
is inherently different
from other economic models.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:17.730
So developing a new and
better set of instructions,

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:21.720
he argues can be treated as a
fixed cost in economic terms.

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:27.270
And it's, therefore, a defining
economics characteristic

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.530
of integration.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.570
So just for an example--

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.282
and this article is
richer than this.

00:59:32.282 --> 00:59:33.990
But I'll just cite a
few examples of what

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:37.280
he's trying to think about.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.780
A Rival Good is property that,
if used by one person or firm,

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:44.960
precludes use by another.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.673
And a Non-rival Good
is a kind of property

00:59:47.673 --> 00:59:49.590
that, if used by one
person or firm, in no way

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:50.920
limits the use by the others.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:56.670
So technology, he argues, is
naturally non-rival, right?

00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:00.110
Because it can be readily
shared and adopted by others.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:03.570
In other words, once
you see this thing

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.130
and understand how
it works, then you

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.830
can make your own
version of it, right?

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:12.360
But there's obviously-- how
would you get rich off this

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.070
if it's completely non-rival?

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:19.860
So capitalists move to
make it excludable, right,

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.170
where the owner of the good--

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:23.910
Steve Jobs and his crew--

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.850
try to prevent
others from using it,

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:30.330
for example, through trade
secrets or patents, right?

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:34.020
So technology can be made
partially excludable.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:42.070
But in the end, technology
has these, remember this term,

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:45.578
spillover features--
knowledge spillover features--

01:00:45.578 --> 01:00:46.870
that make it pretty accessible.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.520
Because you get to
see the technology.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.580
And you can derive ideas
about how it's put together.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.300
So technology is unlike any
other kind of economic good.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.210
Because it can be
both excludable

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:03.100
and non-excludable, rival
and non rival, right?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.750
It's not like anything else.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.085
It's not like owning
a farm, right?

01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:07.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.990
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And you are?

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.640
AUDIENCE: Max.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.390
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Max, good.

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.557
AUDIENCE: This is saying
that technology just really

01:01:12.557 --> 01:01:15.290
specific technology or
technology in general?

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:17.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Technology, in general.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.930
So he's developing a
broader way of looking

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.400
at this whole category.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.280
All right.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.620
So that's one core idea.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.350
Let's try and develop
theories of economics

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:31.840
by which we can better
describe what technology is,

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.240
since it's so key to growth.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.280
But his really
important contribution

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.170
is around the role
of human capital.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:42.730
And that's what I want you
to really remember today.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.840
How can I explain this?

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.900
So it's Rome-- whatever it is--

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.270
200, right?

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:58.650
It's Rome.

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:06.690
And Romans, they're
terrific engineers.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.080
They figured out
these amazing roads.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.120
And they stuck them
around all over Europe.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.460
And that's a technology advance.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.040
And it improves communication
systems and transport.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.860
So it's a technological advance
that carries with it some gain.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:28.440
Now the width of the Roman road
is the defining characteristic

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.640
of the width of
railroads, right?

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.590
That's the distance
between the rails

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.410
is defined by the
Roman road distances,

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:40.020
interestingly, enough.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:47.750
The Romans had a very primitive
kind of toy steam engine

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:51.200
that Roman kids would play with.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.080
And it had an axle
and had this little--

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.050
you heat it up with a
candle or something.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:00.530
And then this little thing
would spin around, puffing away.

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.380
Because you know, water
would boil, and so forth.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.870
And it would sort
of spin around.

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:13.150
Romer would say that the
reason why Romans didn't

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:16.000
take the step of putting
rails on their roads

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.480
and sticking the steam
engines on the rails

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.170
was that they did not have
enough human capital engaged

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.705
in research.

01:03:24.705 --> 01:03:26.830
In other words, they didn't
have a big enough group

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:29.370
of people that were
talented and well-educated

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:33.850
that were figuring out
how to move this toy steam

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:36.900
system to an actual
technology advance,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.390
moving through the invention
and innovation stages.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:46.870
So the human capital
engaged in research

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.690
was the critical
determinant factor

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:53.860
about why they didn't put these
pieces together, all right?

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:57.445
So it's not just doing
a bunch of research.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:04.320
You've got to have the talent
base doing that research,

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.003
and that that will be
a determining factor in

01:04:08.003 --> 01:04:09.420
whether or not
you're going to get

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.110
to the stage of
technological advance.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:13.380
So you follow me?

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.470
So again, that phrase is Human
Capital Engaged in Research.

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:22.770
If you lack human capital
engaged in research,

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.430
you get economic stagnation.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.930
All right.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:27.790
Let's do another picture.

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:28.525
Medieval Europe.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.413
Let's face it.

01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:34.330
There's no human capital
engaged in research--

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:37.900
maybe a few alchemists poking
around in dungeons, all right?

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.000
That's it.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.410
So is their economic
growth in medieval Europe?

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.730
Not really, right?

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.690
I mean, they learned something
about castle building.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:55.650
But a lot of it came
from the Romans, anyway.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.360
Economic growth
basically consisted of,

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.730
you know, hiring a motorcycle
gang and putting on our horses

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.410
and riding over to
the next guy's castle

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.520
and looting the place.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.140
That's how you got gain, right?

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.000
That was the economic
growth model.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.380
It was stealing, right?

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.180
It was like piracy, right?

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.580
There was no economic
growth model.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:20.550
So it's not until the
Industrial Revolution

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.640
that you get a significant
amount of human capital engaged

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.460
in research that's going
to be able to nurture

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.950
these technology advances.

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.720
So we have our second
innovation factor now.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.390
The first factor--

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.120
Solow.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.060
And again, I'm summarizing here.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.570
You got to do R&D. Technological
and related innovation,

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.200
you got to do some R&D.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.970
Romer, the second
factor, human capital

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.000
engaged in research--
kind of the talent base.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.160
Behind that R&D system, behind
that technological advance

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.640
is going to be the talent base.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.240
So that gives us two factors.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:06.390
And you guys can now look at any
country or society or region.

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:10.080
And you can now say, oh, I
can start to look at that.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.740
I can look at, hey, are
they doing a bunch of R&D?

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.730
And two, what's their
talent base like, right?

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.530
Romer developed something that
he calls Prospector Theory.

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.690
Now that's not in this reading.

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:29.730
It's in some of his
somewhat later work.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:31.382
But it's an intriguing idea.

01:06:31.382 --> 01:06:33.090
And it's very simple
and straightforward.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.490
But it'll help you in
making these assessments.

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:42.690
So Romer looks at the chemical
engineering industry in Europe

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:46.920
in the late 1800s.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.610
And he notices that there
are two countries that

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:56.850
dominate these early
chemical industries, Germany

01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.720
and Britain.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.990
They have the big emerging
chemical industries.

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:03.690
And other countries are
doing stuff in this area.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:05.970
But they don't have
anything like what

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:07.930
Germany and Britain are up to.

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:11.610
So then he looks
behind those industries

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:16.260
and finds that both
Germany and Britain

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:22.440
have very strong education
systems for chemical engineers.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.400
So they are creating
a talent base

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.700
that enables the
advances that they are

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.190
making in chemical engineering.

01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:36.540
So the idea is you've got
a field of prospectors.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.760
So let's take it back to
the origin of the idea.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.420
So it's the
California Gold Rush.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.590
And it's 1848.

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.310
It's not 1849, yet.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:46.770
It's 1848.

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:51.630
And you've got
five or six people

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:53.700
hanging around the
Sacramento River,

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.950
occasionally sticking
a pan into the river.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:58.450
All right.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:06.220
Then a year later, 1849,
you've got 250,000 people

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.110
sticking pans into
the Sacramento

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:11.620
River and every traceable,
you know, part of that river

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.040
system, up every creek.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:15.790
What do you think?

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:18.850
You find more gold
with 250,000 people?

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:19.899
You bet.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:22.630
A staggering amount
of gold gets found.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.262
That's Prospector Theory.

01:08:25.262 --> 01:08:27.220
And it's a little more
sophisticated than that.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.740
But you're going
to find more gold

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:34.073
if you've got more
prospectors on the problem.

01:08:34.073 --> 01:08:35.740
Now you have to train
those prospectors.

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.510
It can't be totally
amateur hour.

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:39.069
It's much better
if you have trained

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:43.680
sophisticated prospectors,
like Britain and Germany did,

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.560
with the chemical
engineering sector.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:57.470
So you need that human capital
engaged in the research system.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.430
If the human capital
is driving cabs,

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:02.840
it doesn't do you any good.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.390
You've got to have that
human capital engaged

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.229
in that system of research.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:11.359
So you can then, now, make
a further extrapolation

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.279
on what Romer's
thinking about, right?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.479
You have a way, now, of looking
at fundamental strengths

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.580
of an innovation system.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.816
It's an R&D system and
the talent in that system.

01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:30.704
Questions.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.250
AUDIENCE: To what
extent does his theories

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:46.430
include questions of inclusion?

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:48.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Really
good and timely point.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.810
So if Romer is
right and you want

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:57.273
a large number of
well-trained prospectors,

01:09:57.273 --> 01:09:58.940
and you're fencing
off significant parts

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.860
of your society from
that prospector pool,

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.295
you're doing something
really stupid, right?

01:10:04.295 --> 01:10:05.568
It's just fundamental as that.

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.110
That's how simple
and straightforward

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:09.630
prospector theory is.

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:12.420
That's why what's been happening
over the last few weeks

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.500
makes me so nervous.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:19.530
Because the US developed
an innovation system

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.870
that worked on
encouraging talent

01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.390
from everywhere to come here.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.740
And it's a huge
innovation advantage.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.270
It's huge.

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.690
In other words, if you're
running an innovation system

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:34.090
and sucking in talent from
everywhere to help field it,

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:37.603
to help staff it, that's
really interesting

01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:39.270
compared to running
an innovation system

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:42.060
where you put fences
around your borders.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.500
Not very smart.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:49.170
That's why 400 tech companies
that joined the amicus brief

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:51.030
in the case that's
being argued today.

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:53.190
Because they understand this.

01:10:53.190 --> 01:11:00.010
So there is a huge inclusion
piece to this fundamental idea.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:00.673
Rasheed.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.965
AUDIENCE: Is there too many
cooks in the kitchen, upper

01:11:02.965 --> 01:11:03.470
bound?

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:05.420
I don't think we're there yet.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.550
It's always an
important question.

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:12.980
Does a society have too much
innovation going on, right?

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:17.360
And I think we're not
remotely close to that.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.860
I don't think we're
close to that, right?

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.060
In other words, if technological
and related innovation

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.940
is the key driver
for growth, and we've

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.780
got 2% growth at the moment,
maybe improving the innovation

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.670
system might be a way to
improve our growth rate.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.460
Therefore, one way
of looking at that

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.630
is to get more prospectors
on the problem, right?

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.310
So I mean, that's a
simple-minded idea.

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:49.450
But the prospector theory
is pretty straightforward.

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:51.617
AUDIENCE: Out of curiosity,
what would it look like,

01:11:51.617 --> 01:11:53.992
suppose we did have too many
like he was saying, too many

01:11:53.992 --> 01:11:56.735
cooks [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:56.735 --> 01:11:58.610
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I
think we're just so far

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:02.628
away from this that it's not
really worthy of thought.

01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:03.170
I mean, look.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.000
Periodically, in the
science community

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.540
there's panic about,
heavens, we've

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.290
trained too many
physicists, right?

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:16.430
They're only going to be
able to drive cabs, right?

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.220
That we're in an
oversupply situation.

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.290
And every once in
a while, you get

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:23.720
cycles that, frankly,
largely resemble

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.600
the business cycles that tell us
that we may be at those stages.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.780
And panic hits the
science community

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.420
that we're training
too many numbers.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.640
But if we go back
and think about what

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.250
we've been learning
here, which is

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:42.830
that technological and
related innovation is

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:48.920
a dynamic factor in your
society and your economy,

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.780
it is core to the way
in which you grow,

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:58.430
then the talent base is
a dynamic factor, too.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:00.530
And you don't want to
restrict the dynamic factor.

01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:04.400
Because you're going to limit
your dynamism, all right?

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.590
Don't shut down dynamic factors.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:07.310
Led them thrive.

01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:13.130
The problem science
has, it's not

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:18.170
able to extrapolate to a larger
use of its talent base, right?

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:24.350
Just because there may not be
enough jobs in formal academia

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:26.810
for all of the scientists
who are training

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:29.660
doesn't mean that there aren't
really important functions

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.970
and roles they can
play elsewhere, right?

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.090
So 2/3 of US scientists
and engineers

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:38.427
are employed by manufacturing
industries, right?

01:13:38.427 --> 01:13:40.010
That's where actually
most of the jobs

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.800
are, not in the academy.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.570
And yet the scientific
community views it

01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:46.280
as, oh, it's the academy.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.530
And that's where the
oversupply problem is.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:52.640
But maybe the key here is
equipping that talent base

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.620
with a whole new
set of tools that

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.480
enable them to play a broader
role than simply supporting

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.240
the academy, right?

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.580
Maybe that would be a smarter
talent based training idea.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.633
Maybe you give them
entrepreneurship classes,

01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:09.800
so they can think about
starting their own startups.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.570
Maybe they get business minors,
so they can do startup stuff.

01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:16.970
Maybe they get other
kinds of training

01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.370
that gives them additional
skill sets in addition

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:21.800
to kind of classical
research skill sets.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.770
I think that would probably be
a better answer than attempting

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:27.690
to restrict the supply.

01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:30.860
The historical US
growth rate is 3%.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.850
That's starting to
look pretty good.

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:35.520
Because we haven't been
there for quite some time.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.163
It makes a big difference.

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:40.080
You all probably don't
remember this too well.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:49.160
But the dynamic quality and feel
of the US economy in the 1990s

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.680
was very different.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.530
The sense of opportunity that
was there was very powerful.

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:58.910
And it was pretty pervasive
throughout society.

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:02.990
And if technological and related
innovation drives growth,

01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:06.830
and it's key to a higher
growth rate, than the task is,

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:08.990
not how do you shut
that down, but how

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:14.692
do you get back to a higher
level growth rate, I'd argue.

01:15:14.692 --> 01:15:16.400
AUDIENCE: My concern
would just be, like,

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.900
not too many cooks in the
kitchen, but too many empty

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.400
kitchens.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.358
Because debatably, the
most problems today

01:15:21.358 --> 01:15:26.340
are energy, water, [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.560
But most people right now, 60%
of the people studying at MIT

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.520
study computer science.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:39.790
I'm pretty sure, like, energy,
nuclear [INAUDIBLE] It's just

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:42.478
like, you know, there's
a lot of empty kitchens

01:15:42.478 --> 01:15:44.020
that are the most
important problems.

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.790
But also, from the
capitalist perspective,

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.300
it's like, you want a monopoly.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.700
So it's the place
you want to be.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.360
If you discover fusion,
[INAUDIBLE] $38 trillion dollar

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.528
market for energy.

01:15:53.528 --> 01:15:55.570
Most likely it wouldn't
capture the whole market.

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:56.502
It's too hard.

01:15:56.502 --> 01:15:58.460
So you want to go the
path of least resistance.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.630
But ideally, they get like
$10 trillion, $2 trillion

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:06.280
[INAUDIBLE] So and
the next trillion

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.724
will probably be, like, space
money or something like that.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:13.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.960
I mean, that's an
interesting idea, right?

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.070
And I do think that we do
have too many empty kitchens,

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:23.850
at this point, that need
staffing up, frankly.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:26.490
They need a path to growth.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:32.520
And getting to fourth generation
nuclear power, I mean,

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.120
that's an absolute core
climate strategy, in my view.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.560
But I think it's increasingly
widespread at MIT, right?

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.360
And we're not staffing
that revolution up.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.610
In Romer's terms, we're not
putting enough prospectors

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:46.740
on the problem.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:50.760
It's increasingly
hard to organize

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.440
startups to do something other
than software and biotech.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.690
Because venture capital
is just doing too well

01:16:57.690 --> 01:16:58.440
with those models.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.780
And look there's nothing wrong
with software and biotech.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.690
it's important stuff.

01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:03.840
So there's nothing wrong
with what we're doing.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.000
But we are not funding
other technology sectors.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.880
So we don't have a broad based
approach on technology advance.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.760
See your metaphor, Martine,
of some empty kitchens--

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.970
we're emptying our
kitchens on quote,

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:20.580
"hard technologies," where you
have to manufacture something.

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.840
Because the scale up process is
much harder for that financing

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.780
system to muster than
scaling up a software startup

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.790
where its infrastructure
is in the cloud

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.630
and doesn't cost
anything, and can scale up

01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:40.260
very quickly with very
limited amounts of capital.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.720
It's much more complicated
to stand up and do

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.620
energy technology.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.860
It's a longer term project.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.980
And it's a more expensive
scale a process.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.120
So we're not doing those.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.650
So we've got GAP.

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.990
And we'll talk about
this in the next class,

01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:54.300
In the innovation system.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:59.927
It's yielding a bunch of empty
kitchens around our economy,

01:17:59.927 --> 01:18:02.510
whereas I'd argue what we want
to do is fill those kitchens up

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:04.343
but they've got to have
a pathway to success

01:18:04.343 --> 01:18:06.015
as part of that.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.140
[INAUDIBLE], you follow me?

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.480
Does that add up?

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.845
Is that what you're after?

01:18:09.845 --> 01:18:10.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:11.960
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:14.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Tara, right?

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:14.960
AUDIENCE: Tara, yeah.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.210
I feel like it kind of plays
into this innovation wave

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:20.130
idea, where people sort of flock
and leave different kitchens

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.652
to go to the one kitchen.

01:18:21.652 --> 01:18:22.484
And then, while there's
all these empty kitchens

01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:22.984
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:28.707 --> 01:18:29.790
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:30.290
And, look.

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:34.050
If we could get
energy onto the wave,

01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:36.120
it would make all
the difference.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.250
We could do it, all right?

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:41.177
So if we could manage to
get it into this phase--

01:18:41.177 --> 01:18:43.260
and we're not, we're still
in the build up phase--

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:47.957
but if he could get here, that's
gets to be really interesting.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.040
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that first phase is, like,

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.314
between 40 and 50 years .

01:18:52.314 --> 01:18:54.356
At least for fusion, it's
been like [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.820
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, Max.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.140
I follow fusion a lot.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.320
Because MIT has been
so involved in this.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.520
So that's been one of my more
fun adventures in recent years

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.312
is working with your fusion
team on some of these issues.

01:19:15.312 --> 01:19:16.020
But you're right.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.300
The technological advances
that could actually

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.330
scale this thing, actually now,
I think, for the first time,

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:23.970
appear in sight,
become plausible.

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.230
Still a long term project.

01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:30.310
But I think we're a lot closer
than we were a decade ago.

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:35.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is because
I took your science policy

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.460
bootcamp, not this IP,
but the previous one.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.870
And I was disappointed in
the lack of consideration

01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:44.650
for cultural values in promoting
R&D in science and technology.

01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:46.420
And I've had some
conversations like this.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:49.858
And I'm always sort of prone
to think about the values

01:19:49.858 --> 01:19:52.150
that we promote as a society,
both in the United States

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.120
and across the world, in the
societies that they propagate,

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.030
and how those impact, I guess,
the projects that are funded

01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:01.760
are not [INAUDIBLE] in basic
theories of development,

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.188
for instance development.

01:20:03.188 --> 01:20:04.730
There's a limited
number of resources

01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:05.774
that any organization can apply
to, if they're public, private,

01:20:05.774 --> 01:20:06.274
etc.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:13.078
And what we, as a society, value
and how we brand that value

01:20:13.078 --> 01:20:14.620
and make it appealing
and interesting

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:18.723
to the regular consumer
is of great concern to me,

01:20:18.723 --> 01:20:20.140
especially, because
science is not

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.898
something that's accessible
or exciting to most people.

01:20:23.898 --> 01:20:24.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.160
[INAUDIBLE],, you're
right on a whole series

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.430
of big important
problems that we

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:34.780
need to keep bringing into
this class discussion.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:38.230
And creating a
culture around science

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.650
and creating culture around
technology and development,

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.250
a culture around
entrepreneurship,

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:44.590
and a culture around
startups, those

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.680
turn out to be fairly key.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.660
It's hard for
economics that's trying

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.820
to do mathematical
modeling to capture

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:56.950
these cultural,
historical issues.

01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:58.390
But they're there.

01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:02.200
And you know, part of what
makes innovation systems theory

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.050
so interesting is just the
sheer complexity of that system

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:07.570
and the number of
variables operating there.

01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:11.620
And you're right on
an important point.

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:17.420
Understanding the historical
context, for example,

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.440
turns out to be pretty key when
you look at innovation systems

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.360
in different regions
of the world, right?

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.510
Different regions have different
ways of organizing innovation

01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:27.560
systems.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.690
The innovation system that
got organized in Japan,

01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:31.490
coming out of the
Second World War

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:35.623
is a very different innovation
system than the US organized.

01:21:35.623 --> 01:21:37.790
And we'll try and talk about
some of that, actually,

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:39.270
in the next class.

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:42.650
But keep bringing us back
to these cultural factors.

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:44.270
Thank you.

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:45.520
Martha, you've got a question.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.270
AUDIENCE: I'm just
going to briefly say...

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.180
It's not really a question but
politics and leadership really

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:52.230
plays a big role here.

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:56.300
And why haven't wenot to
dwell on energy too much

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.660
been able to pull up a
Manhattan Project for energy

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.000
or the [INAUDIBLE] getting
somebody to the moon.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.340
I mean, those were
clearly having

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.950
the leader of the
free world stand up

01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.270
and say, this is a priority.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It would
have been useful, right?

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:17.597 --> 01:22:18.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.545
And I mean, in a society,
there in the end,

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:23.420
there is no substitute
for leadership, right?

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.850
You really need a big
dose of that as well.

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:30.830
And we will talk more
about innovation systems

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:34.970
and how can you nurture
change agents, particularly,

01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:38.810
for innovation in these legacy
established complex sectors,

01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:42.110
like energy, helping you
introduce change agents.

01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:44.865
And what tool sets can they
use to actually drive change.

01:22:44.865 --> 01:22:46.490
So we'll talk about
that, particularly,

01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:47.870
in the energy class.

01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:50.171
But it's relevant
to many others.

GILBERT STRANG:
Well, I'm Gil Strang.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.650
And I'm very happy if you
know the linear algebra

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.620
videos on OpenCourseWare
or on YouTube.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.750
That's for the
math course 18.06.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.409
And I'm even happier
if you like them.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:38.590
And I'm here today to update
them for several reasons.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.320
Well, a lots happened in
linear algebra in these years.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.280
Fortunately, the
whole subject has just

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.760
become more and more essential,
more and more important, more

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.380
and more beautiful.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.650
And so I wanted to say something
about those later steps.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.710
And also, when I teach it now,
I have a new starting point.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.980
And I'll show you that.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.110
So I'll go a little slowly
on that starting point.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.460
The slides tell you
the whole course.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.340
And that's crazy to have a full
course within a short video.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.650
But especially the
first part is new.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.580
And I'm even writing
a textbook called

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.310
Linear Algebra for Everyone
that will start this way.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.970
I hope that the new start brings
in real linear algebra ideas

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.030
right away.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.700
And let me show you
where those are.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.800
So this is an outline
of the whole video.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.640
And the first
line, which I think

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.930
about in my mind as
matrix A, is a product

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.730
of a C matrix, a column
matrix, and a row matrix R.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.600
And you'll see what those are.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
So that's the new idea.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.080
That will come first.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.430
Then these are five
famous essential shorthand

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.720
descriptions of the key
chapters of linear algebra,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.710
the key chapters.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.720
So they represent, for example,
LU is those letters are famous.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.930
And computer commands
would be exactly

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.430
those letters LU for elimination
for solving equations,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.710
the first job of linear algebra.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.400
And then QR.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.660
So Q is a very interesting
important type of matrix.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.150
That's standing for
an orthogonal matrix.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.650
There is the word
orthogonal or perpendicular.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.340
So those are the best
matrices to compute with.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.250
And that QR gets us there.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.640
And S is for a symmetric matrix.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.100
And it will involve--

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.570
oh, well, I should
say, the first half,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.650
ending with there, with QR,
is about solving equations.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.270
The second half, these
three are about eigenvalues

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.460
and eigenvectors
and singular values,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.050
a different way to approach the
whole subject and a very, very

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.760
important way.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.310
Among my goals is to help
courses around the world

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.720
get singular values
included because you really

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.460
don't want to miss them.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.340
That's the high
point of the theory.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.740
And it's expressed
like all the others

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.580
as breaking a matrix into
two or three pieces, two

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.930
or three parts.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.130
So that's my plan
for this video.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.140
And I hope it's helpful.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.320
Again, it's a whole
course in a short time.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:08.240
And please go to the real
18.06 videos for the details.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.490
Thanks

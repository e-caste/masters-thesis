00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
PROFESSOR: So I want
to go a little further

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.650
to try to put resonances in
a more intriguing footing.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:18.840
That you can play with and if
you-- at some point interested.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.252
So let's think of discovering
[INAUDIBLE] that we have.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.590
We had A s--

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:36.810
remember the scattered wave was
A s e to the ikx [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.386
that divided 2.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.220
And what was A s?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.110
Well, A s squared--

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.590
the sine square delta.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.110
So if you remember this was
sine delta e to the i delta.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.830
So let's stick to that and try
to write it in a funny way.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.690
Certainly, A s is becoming
large near resonance,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.895
so let's think when
A s becomes large.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:21.016
Well, in another way let's be
a little creative about things,

00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:24.960
It's good sometimes
not to be logical.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.587
So let's write this
as sine delta--

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:33.054
I'll do it here--

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:39.720
sine delta over e to
the minus i of delta .

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:50.191
And that's sine delta over
close delta minus i sine delta.

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.179
That's all good.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.010
A s-- let me divide by
sine delta both sides--

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.150
both numerator and denominator.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.180
So-- no divide it
by cosine delta,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.326
so I'll have tan delta
over 1 minus i tan delta.

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:15.950
I divide it by cosine.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.603
You want A s large?

00:02:26.603 --> 00:02:33.520
You really want it
large, choose tan delta--

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.030
equals to minus i.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.365
Sounds crazy, but
it's not really crazy.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.780
The reason it sounds crazy and
it's somewhat strange and not

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.260
very logical is tan
delta is a phase

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.960
and the tangent of any phase
is never an imaginary number.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.595
So then I would have
think of delta itself

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:09.294
as a complex number.

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.150
And what would that mean.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.390
So things are weird.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.290
But it's certainly the fact
that A s will become infinite--

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.130
not just large-- but infinite.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.981
A s will become infinite.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.750
And you say, wow, this
doesn't make any sense.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.300
But maybe it makes sense
in the following way.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.740
This is the line of
real phase shifts.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.585
[INAUDIBLE] are real.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:58.180
And here is the world
of complex phase shifts.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.455
These are the real phase shifts
and there are the complex phase

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:03.170
shifts.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.840
Maybe if the phase
shift becomes infinite--

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.760
off the real axis--

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.950
it's just large
on the real axis.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.750
So actually, if you
wanted it to be very large

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.314
you would have to get
off the real axis.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.620
If this sounds vague,
it is still vague.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.260
But in a minute we'll
make it precise.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.190
So I suggest that we take
this idea seriously--

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.260
that maybe this means something.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.720
And we can try to argue
that by looking back

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.220
at what resonances do.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.870
So what I will do is look with
[INAUDIBLE] a resonance here--

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.070
tangent delta.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.400
So let's look at what A s does.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.290
We have it there.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.401
A s is tan delta--
well, tan delta--

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:21.720
we had it in the
middle of blackboard

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.490
is beta over alpha
minus k, 1 minus i beta

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.780
over alpha minus k, again.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.944
So that's how A s
behaves in general.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.300
That's fine, there's no -- at
this moment there's nothing

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.797
crazy about this.

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:48.100
Because this is
something you all agreed,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.900
nobody complained
about this formula.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.330
So A s is given
by that formula--

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.710
that's also legal math, so far.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.250
So we'll have this.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.150
And then let's simplify
it a little bit which

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.830
is beta over alpha
minus k minus i beta.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:24.970
So this still beta over
alpha minus i beta minus k.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:39.397
So we usually would plot
A s as a function of k.

00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:42.710
That's what we're trying to
do, it's a function of k.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.530
And now here is the formula
for A s as the function of k.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.240
And here is k.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.550
But let's be daring now
and not say this is k,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.340
this is the complex k-plane.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.390
And yes, you work with
real k, but that's

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.210
because that has a direct
physical interpretation.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.275
But maybe the complex
plane has a more subtle

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:19.702
physical interpretation
and that's

00:07:19.702 --> 00:07:23.310
what they claim
is happening here.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:30.190
This quantity becomes
infinite near the resonance.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.010
Here was the resonance,
what you call the resonance.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.940
But this becomes really
infinite not at alpha--

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.625
for when k is equal
to alpha, but when k

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:45.330
is equal to alpha minus i beta.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.080
Beta was supposed to be
small for a resonance.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:08:00.270
So here is minus i beta and
here is this very unusual point.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.610
Where the scattering
amplitude blows up.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.820
It has what is in
complex variables--

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.630
if you've taken 1806
it's called a pole.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.750
In a complex variable
when you have

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.200
a denominator that vanishes
linearly we call it a pole.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.210
Things blow up.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.180
So this carrying amplitude
has a pole off the real axis.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.470
And interpretation is correct.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.977
At this point, this
function becomes infinite.

00:08:33.977 --> 00:08:37.062
And what is happening
on the real line

00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:40.510
that A s is becoming
large is just

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.380
the remnant of that
infinity over here

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.490
that is affecting the
value of this point.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.320
So in the complex plane
you understand the function

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.770
a little better.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.150
You see why it's
becoming big and you

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.260
can see also with a
little [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.110
why the phases
shifting very fast

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.350
because you have this point.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.204
And that's called the resonance.

00:09:08.204 --> 00:09:11.740
And this is the
mathematically precise way

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.165
of searching for resonances.

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:19.210
If you want to search for
resonances what you should do

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.110
is you have your formula for
delta as a function of k.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.965
I mean, it's a
complicated formula,

00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:34.880
but now try to solve the
equation tan delta of this

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.590
is equal to minus
i because that's

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.160
what guarantees
that you have a pole

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.740
that indeed it blows
up at some value.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.630
That's where A s blows up which
we see directly here-- it's

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.565
this value.

00:09:52.565 --> 00:10:03.240
Alpha minus i beta, so alpha
minus i beta is a pole of A s.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.860
And therefore, you must be
happening when tangent of delta

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.760
is equal to minus i.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.430
So you have a very
complicated formula

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.170
maybe for tangent of delta.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.000
But set it equal to minus
i and asked mathematically

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.400
to solve it.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.590
And a number will come--

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:33.470
k a equal 2.73 minus 0.003.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:38.180
And you will know-- oh, that's
a resonance, it's off the axis.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.200
And the real part is
the value of alpha.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.470
And since this is beta
the closer to the axis --

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.115
if you find more--

00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:50.642
the more resonant it is.

00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:53.135
And by the time it's
far from the axis,

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:55.360
some people call it the
resonance-- some people say,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.420
no that not the resonance.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.780
It's a matter of taste.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.490
But there are important
things which are these poles.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.480
So I will not give
you exercises on that,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.550
but you may want
to try it if you

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.950
want to have some entertainment
with these things.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.250
I want to say one
more thing about this.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:28.290
And it's the reason why this
viewpoint is interesting,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.260
as well.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.360
We already found that if we
want to think of resonances more

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.340
precisely.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.925
We can think of them
as just an equation.

00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:42.210
You solve for the equation,
so that it gives you

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.140
the resonance.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.500
And this is the
equation you must solve

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:53.875
and you must admit complex k.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.250
But now you can say,
look actually you

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.726
have e is equal to h
squared, k squared, over 2m.

00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:16.870
And we have real k's--

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.920
this is the physical
scattering solutions,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.000
complex k's, also resonances.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.730
How about imaginary k's?

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.226
If k is equal to i kappa--

00:12:33.226 --> 00:12:37.190
kappa belonging to
the real numbers--

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:43.610
then the energy becomes minus
h squared, kappa squared,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.845
over 2m and its less
than zero and it

00:12:46.845 --> 00:12:48.780
could represent bound states.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.770
So you'll be then discovering
solutions of real k

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.400
representing your waves.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.240
Now mathematically, you
are led to resonances

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.140
understood as poles
in the scattering

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.300
amplitutde we did here.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:22.104
We see that k's in
the imaginary axis

00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:24.840
would represent bound states.

00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:31.530
So the complex
k-plane is very rich.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.675
It has room for your
scattering solutions,

00:13:34.675 --> 00:13:37.190
it has room for your
resonance, it even

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.990
has room for your bound states.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.310
They're all there.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.580
That's why it's a
valuable extension.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.940
I have now proven for you
that bound states correspond

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.420
to poles.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.550
It's a simple calculation, and
that I would assign it to you

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.380
with a little bit of guidance.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.020
And you will see that also
for the case of bound states,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.766
you get a pole in the
scattering amplitude,

00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:10.550
and that will complete the
interpretation of that.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.340
Now people go a little
further, actually,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.596
and they invent
poles in this part

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:21.292
and they're called
anti-bound states.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.310
And you'll say, what's that?

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.520
If you have a bound state
you match a solution

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.010
to a pure decaying exponential
for the [INAUDIBLE] region.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.285
In an anti-bound bound state
you match your solution

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:44.106
to a pure increasing
exponential.

00:14:44.106 --> 00:14:46.010
A pure one.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.765
Does that have an
interpretation?

00:14:47.765 --> 00:14:50.460
It actually does
have interpretation.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.790
Some nuclear states
are associated

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.230
with anti-bound states.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.665
So the mathematical
description--

00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:00.800
the rich complex
plane is ready for you

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.680
if you just do
scattering amplitude k,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.800
resonances-- complex k.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.385
Normal bound states,
imaginary k-- positive.

00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:13.080
Anti-bounds is negative k.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.030
It's a nice start.

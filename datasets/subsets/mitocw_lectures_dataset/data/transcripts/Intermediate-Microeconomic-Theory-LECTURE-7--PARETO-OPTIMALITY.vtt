00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:13.540 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Let's think about where

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:90%
we are in the class.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You should have the
calendar in front of you.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:90%
So we're at lecture 7 today.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of a big
moment because we're fully

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:84%
embracing general
equilibrium although you've

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:90%
seen versions of it before.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The other thing would
be the reading list.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
For today, there is not a lot of
new material on the reading is,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
not a lot of starred materials.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
Pareto optimality.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And the assigned
starred reading is

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
some of the sections
in Kreps, which

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
is available on the Canvas
website, so not much

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:90%
additional stuff to read.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do risk
sharing at the end of it

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:90%
and then look--

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.136 align:middle line:84%
get in more into
the applications

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in lectures 8 and 9.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:90%
In terms of the study guide--

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
so, again, let me ask
you a few questions.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
We did dynamic
optimization last time.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first question is
really the motivation, but not

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
everything--

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the motivation and the economic
problems we're trying to solve

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:84%
are as important to the class
as the tools and techniques

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%
that we're learning.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you, what are
the observations on storage

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
on carryover of last year's
crop to this year's harvest that

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
motivated that lecture
that we did last time?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.925 align:middle line:90%
Wang Peng, can you answer that?

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sorry.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Guanpeng can you

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:90%
take a stab at this question?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
What are the observations
on storage carryover

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of last year's crop
to this year's crop

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.805 align:middle line:84%
that motivated the
lecture from last time?

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I believe the
observation was that it wasn't

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.243 align:middle line:90%
necessarily that common for--

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
so I think it was
like the crops that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
were carried over generally
there's two ways to use both.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
One is carried over to
be planted for next year

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and carry over for consumption.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.847 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.847 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Those were the two ways to
quote, "store the harvest."

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.048 align:middle line:84%
Did they carry it over for
consumption very frequently?

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I don't
think so especially

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
because the spoilage
rate was relatively high.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: OK, yeah.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:90%
So it was quite rare.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Carryover was quite rare.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the
model and its parameters

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.307 align:middle line:84%
was to explain why
that would be the case.

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:08.974 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:03:08.974 --> 00:03:10.967 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: The
title of the lecture

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:90%
was storage seed and starvation.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember how often
were they starving to death?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.917 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It was once
every decade or 12 years.

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Yes, that's right.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Good, all right.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that was the
motivation for that lecture.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And then this question--

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
although I don't-- you won't be
able to write it down for me,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you can
say it in words.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
What was the notation we
used for the return to seed?

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, in what way
was it linear or at least up

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:90%
to a limit?

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And in which way did it
depend on uncertainty?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And let me see, Armando,
can you take a stab at that?

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
Are you there, Armando?

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Armando?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, my microphone was muted.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so there was--

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was there was
three multipliers, right.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It was they each had a
random chance of occurring.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a poor
harvest, medium harvest,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and good harvest.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was just linear.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The harvest, the
amount harvested

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
is linear with how much they
planted with either a 1,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
2, or 4 multiplier,
I believe, was it?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
That's right.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was epsilon
times alpha times k,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
where k was the amount
of land planted,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
alpha was the linear
constant, and epsilon

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
capture those shocks you
just mentioned low, medium,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and high.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's a perfect answer.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's blending-- the
point of why I'm asking

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
is just to remind you that,
oh, because it's linear,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
its constant returns to scale.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet it also incorporated
the uncertainty.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to come
back to that technology

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
when we look at
applications of risk sharing

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
in a couple of lectures.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, and this
next one, write down

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
a flow equation for consumption
in terms of the above notation,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
but I can't expect
you to write it down.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So could someone
describe in words

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.185 align:middle line:84%
what the constraint is onto the
problem in terms of this flow

00:05:59.185 --> 00:05:59.685 align:middle line:90%
equation?

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll take a volunteer.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I remember
the consumption

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the output
of the last year

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:27.045 align:middle line:84%
input plus the output of
the inventory and a minus

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
how much you want to leave
for next year as the seed

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and how much you leave for
next year as the inventory.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.012 align:middle line:90%
That was consumption.

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
That's perfect.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And the consumption
should be larger than 0, right?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: For each period?

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: That's
another constraint, yeah.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
This flow equation you
just described so well.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
I was looking for.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So to elaborate, we talked
about resources available today,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's the stuff
coming from current harvest

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:90%
plus depreciated storage.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And then also, how much would
it be available tomorrow?

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is co-determined
with consumption.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
available resources,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
but you can use it for
consumption or you can save it.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
different ways to save.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So your answer was very
good, and I'm just repeating

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
in slightly different words.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I guess last one is principal
of dynamic programming.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:90%
This is a bit more technical.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I don't want to hide
anything from you, especially

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
when we subsequently
jump back and forth

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
between finite horizon and
infinite horizon problems.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone remember
how we converted

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:90%
into two period problems?

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So we
picked the last date

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and solved the maximization
problem using that last date,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and then iterated to
the next last date

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
until we got back
to the first date.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Excellent.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.085 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the next part,
the infinite horizon part,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:90%
is we just keep going like that.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We just keep iterating, so
that the final terminal date

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
is so far away that
effectively they're

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
acting the way they would in
an infinite horizon problem.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
probably enough time spent

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:90%
on those review questions.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me then turn to the
lecture today, lecture 7.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
All right, so a brief outline
of what we're going to do--

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to define this
concept of various concepts,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Pareto optimality,
then Pareto frontier.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to show you a
programming problem, a math

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
problem so to speak, that
allows us to determine,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
as its solution, all possible
Pareto optimal allocations.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go and apply it

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
in the case of uncertainty
and call the solution

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
the optimal allocation of risk.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So although this slide says
utility possibilities set,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be the
bottom line of the slide,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
this is also a hugely important
slide for the whole course

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's the first time, I
think, that we've introduced,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in notation, all the ingredients
we've been covering so far

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and, in the notation,
describing an economy.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I went back and
looked at lecture 1.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It does say an economy is
preferences, endowments,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
We called it a PET economy
as a way to remember.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:90%
But here it is in notation.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So an economy, script
epsilon or economy,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is the consumption
set and preferences

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
of each of finite
number of agents,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the production set of each of
the finite number of firms,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and some aggregated
social endowment.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very succinct list,
preferences, endowments,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Then an allocation
for the whole economy

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:84%
now is an allocation x for each
of the capital I consumers,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
an allocation in the production
set for each of the capital

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:90%
J producers.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
If we're in finite
dimensional Euclidean space

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and there are capital L goods,
then we have L times I plus J

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:84%
dimensional vectors here
belied by this relatively brief

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
notation.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're going to
have to specify a consumption

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:84%
vector Xi in the consumption
set for each consumer

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.775 align:middle line:84%
i, a production plan Yj
in the production set.

00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It's capital Yj for each
firm j of the capital J.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And we say an allocation
is feasible if and only

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:84%
if the consumptions are feasible
given resources available,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
which would be coming from the
endowment and from production.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of
comments-- sometimes

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
people will write
consumption less than

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
or equal to as if you
could throw something away.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just more useful today to
talk about it as an equality.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is this
has buried behind it--

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy to write--

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
all of the business we've
been working with respect

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to negative and
positive elements.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So for example, some of
these Yj's are negative.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I refer to it as production
as if it were all positive,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:90%
like grain or something.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But if an input is
negative over here,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
then there has to be
some offsetting element.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Namely, consumers supply it,
or it could be more evident

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:90%
coming from their endowment.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
the accounting quote

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of all the positive and negative
stuff is kind of buried.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But it is easier to
remember this way,

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because it looks like
you just have resources

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
available from
endowments and production

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
meeting up with resources
used in consumption.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, now given the
same economy, we

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
can define the set of
all possible utilities,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:84%
utility possibilities set,
which is this script U

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and which is a
specification of utility

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:90%
for each and every household.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So this has the dimension
capital I, which

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%
is the number of households.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a vector
of that dimension.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to say that a
vector U bar is in this set.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And if two things are
true, first of all,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a
feasible allocation

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
generating it or generating
something with at least

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:90%
as much utility.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So a vector over here, say, the
i-th component of this vector,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
has to be able to be generated
by part of a feasible

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
allocation, which is
specifying Xi for household

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
i, which, when substituted
in the utility function,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
generates a utility
level at least as great

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
as the target,
namely U bar sub i.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, it would be a
little more intuitive just

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
to put equality here.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But what this
allows us to say is,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
if you can generate a utility
point through a feasible

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
allocation, then all the utility
points which are southwest

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
of it are also feasible.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if you could
throw things away.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So in words, this utility
possibility set is a set up all

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
utility profiles for households
in the economy that can be

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
attained by feasible allocation,
a feasible allocation with

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
greater than or
equal-- small typo--

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
so you can generate
v. In other words,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.456 align:middle line:84%
if you can generate U
and v is less than U,

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
you can have v in the production
possibility set as well.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever
that generated U

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
or something generating utility
greater than or equal to U

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
will generate utility greater
than or equal to v, all right?

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So given a utility
possibility set, script U,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we define the Pareto frontier,
P of U, as the boundary.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the set of
subset of utility vectors

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
such that there is
nothing northeast.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
If U is in the utility
possibility set,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
there's no U prime
in there, which

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
would generate at least as
much utility for all households

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
i and strictly greater
utility for some households j.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So if the right
hand side were true,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
then you could quote, "Pareto
dominate" the vector U.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And that would eliminate it
from being in what we want

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:90%
to call the Pareto frontier.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example
and then a picture.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's simplify our economy
and get rid of production,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
although we will
still have endowments.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a pure
exchange economy.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
There are only two goods.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And there are two consumers.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:90%
L and I are equal to 2.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to say,
for simplicity of notation,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
first good is denoted X. The
second good is denoted Z.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So the first household has the
utility function over X and Z,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:84%
which is just linearly
additive in the 2.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the second household
is very similar,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
except it is multiplied by
2, but it's still linear,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
additive, and so on.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, each has equal
endowment of both goods.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And the endowment
of household one

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the endowment
of household two.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So 1/2, 1/2 everywhere means
there's 1 unit of good 1

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:84%
in total, although it's
split initially equally

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
across the two households, and
1 unit of good 2 available,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:90%
also split equally.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So a feasible allocation
over these two goods

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:90%
X and Z has to sum up properly.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the
first good and add up

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.470 align:middle line:84%
what household 1 is getting,
what household 2 is getting,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
it's got to equal the
endowment, which is 1,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
likewise for the second good,
Z. What the first guy gets

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.685 align:middle line:84%
and the second guy
gets in allocation--

00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:50.555 align:middle line:84%
it's not utility--
has to add up to 1,

00:16:50.555 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
the sum of the endowments, OK.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%
So it can be shown--

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and I will show
you the picture--

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that the utility
possibility set consists

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of all points U2, which
are less than 4 minus 2U1.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And the frontier is just
the outer portion of that.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Without doing all the
algebra right now,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you can just
imagine, for example,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if we gave
the entire social endowment

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:90%
to agent 2.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Agent 2 would then
get 1 here, 1 here.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And you get 2 plus 2 equal 4.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And you see this 4 down here,
which is the maximum utility

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%
that agent 2 could get.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it's minus
means moving away from there.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We're giving agent 1 some
of the social endowment

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and taking away
from household 2.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And since 2's utility level's
twice that of household 1,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:84%
then every unit
utility that 2 gives up

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
counts twice for household 1.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's just to be
motivational without actually

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:90%
going through all the algebra.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Here is what the utility
of possibilities frontier

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It's linear, again, with 4
over here as the maximal point.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a slope of minus 2.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It's negative because you're
giving up the social endowment

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
away from 2 toward 1 as
you move along this line.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
What's not drawn in here very
carefully are the boundaries

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of consumption and so on,
which if X1 and X2, Z1,

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Z2 cannot go negative, then we
shouldn't be drawing in this

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
thing that extends
beyond the first orthon.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Pareto optimality,
this is the big one,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
but it's almost obvious already.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
An allocation x and y for
consumption and production

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is Pareto optimal
if it's feasible

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's no other
feasible allocation x prime,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
y prime such that
the prime is at least

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
as good from every
agent i's point of view

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's at least one
i prime household agent

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
that really likes prime better.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And we call these allocations
the Pareto set, the set

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:90%
of Pareto optimal allocations.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, at one level,
it's kind of intuitive

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that those should
be called optimal

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
because you can't make anyone
better off without making

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:90%
someone worse off.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
If you could make
everyone better off,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
then it wouldn't be Pareto
optimal to begin with.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
A little more telling,
this definition

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't give a darn about
the distribution of income.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's no normative
statement here about equality

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and the income distribution
or anything like that.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's a little bit jarring.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We could give all the allocation
to household 2 and none

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
to household 1, and that
would still be Pareto optimal.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the
distribution of income,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and we surely will often
in the subsequence lectures

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and in some of the
pictures about to follow.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
That means, if you want to
talk about the distribution

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
of income and put some
normative criteria for that,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need more
than this definition of Pareto

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:90%
optimality.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's do a
two-person economy.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
This is literally putting
the pieces together.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We did for households,
utility functions

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and preference orderings.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And this puts consumer 1 with
two goods, changing the names

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to a and b now, nice,
smooth, regular decreasing

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:90%
marginal rates of substitution.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and household
1's endowment is

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
here, mark e, which means
a certain amount of good b

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and a certain amount of good a.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
households, but we're

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:84%
going to make this
guy stand on his head.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So the 0 point for
household b is here.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And more of good
b moves downward.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:90%
More of good a moves leftward.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are regular, nice,
smooth, concave, quasi-concave

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
indifference curves
preference sets

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:90%
with more preferred to less.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And here's the endowment
of agent 2, boom, boom--

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
certain amount of good 2,
a certain amount of be,

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of good a.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:90%
You with me so far?

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I think this came from
Kreps, but, you know,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the Edgeworth box is a
big part of economics.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
take this point e

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and start moving this
whole figure for consumer 2

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to the point that these two e's
correspond and are identically

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:90%
lying on top of one another.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's like moving
this edge of what's

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
about to become the box
over in this direction.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And here, although e should
have been ideally put

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
on this picture, this
would be the Edgeworth box.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've got
household 1 down here,

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
consumer 2 here, and the
indifference curves of both.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
The endowment, say, here, is
denoting the good a assigned

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
initially as an
endowment to consumer 1,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
but the other
direction here is good

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:90%
b being assigned to household 2.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:90%
So things add up.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The total adds up
except you're moving--

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
the amounts are signifying
different directions

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:84%
for the two consumers because
consumer 2 is upside down.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So are there questions about
the construction of the box?

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, so without putting
the endowment in there,

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:84%
this would be red indifference
curves for household agent 1,

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
bluish indifference
curves for consumer 2.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I call them consumers,
households, and agents.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being consistent.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They're all called
consumers in this diagram.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see these
indifference curves cross.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want to claim, going
back to the definition,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that this cannot
be Pareto optimal.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Because there are plenty of
other feasible allocations

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that make at least one
household better off

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%
and the other no worse off.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
are many allocations

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
that make them both better off.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
This whole region here lies
above the red indifference

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:84%
curve for household consumer 1
and above the blue indifference

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:90%
curve for consumer 2.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's a different
picture where

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the two baseline indifference
curves are tangent.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And in contrast, this
is Pareto optimal

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
because I challenge you
to find an allocation that

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
makes one better off without
making the other one worse off.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to make
consumer one better off,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep track of
these red indifference curves.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.052 align:middle line:84%
So we would be on or above
the red indifference curve

00:23:46.052 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether
we're making them no worse

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:90%
off or strictly better off.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And any of those points
other than the starting point

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
actually makes
consumer 2 worse off.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can
talk-- this is still

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
called Edgeworth Box,
although it's starting

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to look more like a rectangle.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
That's because there's more of
good 1 than there is of good 2.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It's wider than it is high.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And what's being
traced out here,

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
like this is from
the previous slide,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that there are many other
allocations which are also

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Pareto optimal, where those
indifference curves are

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:90%
tangent.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So this dotted orange yellow
brick road, so to speak,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
dotted line, is a
set of all Pareto

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocations
in the whole economy.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, it's a
lot less, a lot fewer,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
allocations than any
other feasible allocation.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Any allocation in
this box is feasible

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
because resource allocations
add up to the total endowment.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:90%
So [INAUDIBLE] worse off.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see
these extreme distributions,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
where, if we could go that far
to 0,0, consumer 1 over here

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:90%
is in a terrible situation.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And consumer 2 just
got everything.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's feasible,
as is at this point--

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:90%
feasible, also optimal.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does this [INAUDIBLE]
have some special properties?

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Yeah, it's where,

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
in this sense with these all
smooth indifferent curves,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rates
of substitution

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that we learned about are equal
across the two households.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.633 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
You know, the reason

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
this isn't optimal is
because the marginal rates

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:90%
of substitution are not equal.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So the amount that
consumer 2 requires

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
to maintain indifference, giving
up good a and getting good b,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is greater than what
consumer 1 requires

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
to maintain indifference in
terms of giving up good a

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:90%
and getting good b.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's plenty of
quote, "gains to trade."

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.255 align:middle line:90%
Both can be made better off, OK?

00:26:00.255 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, I mean, one
thing we could have done

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is put the endowment
point here and then

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
looked at the set
of-- well, maybe

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
imagine this is the
endowment point.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we could look at
the set of allocations,

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
which are Pareto optimal.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And that yellow brick
road would run like that.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And so these allocations
in the lens shaped region

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:84%
are a subset of the Pareto
optimal allocations, which

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
make one or both agents
strictly better off

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:90%
than at the endowment.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's a more refined
notion of optimality

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
called the core, which I didn't
create a slide to show you.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of beginning
to take into account that you

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
can't make someone worse
off than their endowment,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
whereas Pareto optimality, as I
keep saying, does not do that.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:90%
It's much more general.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, Pareto optimality and
the utility possibility

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:84%
set, let's define, if
it's not obvious already.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:03.020 align:middle line:84%
An allocation of consumption and
production is Pareto optimal--

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:90%
actually, it's a theorem.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
We defined Pareto
optimality already.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And we defined the
Pareto set already.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So this puts them together in
a rather obvious way, namely

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
an allocation x, y is
Pareto optimal if and only

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
if the utilities that
are generated under x

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
are on the frontier
of the Pareto set,

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.945 align:middle line:84%
which we denoted P script U.
So you can go both ways here.

00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It's if and only if the
direction from Pareto

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
optimal to being on the
frontier is left as an exercise.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much as trivial
as the one we're going to do,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
but we'll do one
of the many way.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's go in the
opposite direction.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That is we start with an
allocation on the Pareto

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
frontier, then we want to show
that it's a Pareto optimum.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
almost just a test

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:90%
of remembering the definitions.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that it were
not Pareto optimal,

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
then we'll do a proof
by contradiction.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not Pareto optimal,
then there has to exist,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
by the definition, some
other feasible allocation

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
denoted with a tilde
such that utility

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is at least as high under
the tilde allocation

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
as it was under the
original and strictly

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
greater in utility
for some household j.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But then these vectors
of allocations Pareto

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:84%
dominate the original one
and, hence, the original one

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:84%
could not have been in
the Pareto frontier.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to
remember that is

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that, if it's on
the Pareto frontier,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing northeast of it.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We just constructed
something northeast of it.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the contradiction.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
So this direction is now proved.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And separately after
class, you can take a stab

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:90%
at the other direction.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the moral
of the story here

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
is we can go back and forth
between the Pareto frontier

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and Pareto optimal allocations.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And even I have to be careful
not to intermingle them

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
because I know it
principle they're the same.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
proof that they are.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Next step, we defined
a welfare function

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
for the entire economy,
and we make it linear.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So this big welfare comes
from the utility vector

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:90%
across the individual agents.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And this welfare
function is linear

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:84%
when it's just a weighted
average of the underlying

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
utility components
with weights lambda i.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Weights good in principle be 0,
somebody doesn't count at all.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the
weights are positive.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I say we take
a weighted average,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:84%
each of the weights might
as well sum up to 1.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
didn't, we could add up

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever they do
total to and divide

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
through the same
objective function.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
maximize one welfare function,

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you maximize the
scalar multiple of it.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of this welfare
function is a way I don't like,

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:84%
but then I'll tell
you what I do like.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of aggregating
utilities across individuals

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
in society as if there were some
social planner who determines

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:90%
who counts more than others.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And particularly under the
linear welfare function,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:84%
the lambda weights are the
weights on the individuals.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I do like about this
is this math problem, as it

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:84%
were, which, if there
were a social planner,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
we would be maximizing the
weighted sum of utilities

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:84%
subject to allocations being in
the utility possibilities set.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like we've ignored
feasibility and everything,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:90%
but no.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:84%
The feasibility of
an allocation is

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
loaded into the definition of
the utility possibilities set

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.710 align:middle line:84%
script U, and we're constrained
to pick utility vectors which

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:90%
are in that set.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
pick them in such a way

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
as to maximize this lambda
weighted sum of utilities.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And we can call that
the planner's problem.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So the big result is going to
be-- let me say it in words--

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
that, with certain
relatively weak assumptions,

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:84%
any Pareto optimal
allocation that we pick

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.370 align:middle line:84%
will be a solution to
the planning problem

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:90%
for some weights lambda.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And any solution to the planning
problem for given weights

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:90%
lambda will be Pareto optimal.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So the conceptualization
thing here,

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:84%
before we get lost
in the notation,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.400 align:middle line:84%
is that we can now
go back and forth

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:84%
between the notions
of Pareto optimality

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of maximizing
the social welfare function,

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.100 align:middle line:90%
although the weights can vary.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at the math.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we add a solution to
the planner's problem seven.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And just to make it easier,
suppose the lambda weights

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:90%
are all strictly positive.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the first claim is
that solution to seven

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:90%
must be in the Pareto set.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And if it's on the
Pareto frontier, sorry,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:90%
then it must be Pareto optimal.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Going the other way, if
the utility possibility set

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is convex and
closed, then picking

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.200 align:middle line:84%
any utility on the
Pareto frontier

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and, hence, Pareto optimal,
we can find particular lambda

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
weights that makes that
utility vector a solution

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.560 align:middle line:90%
to the planner's problem.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's do
the two parts a bit.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:84%
For the first
part, suppose we're

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
given some U star that
solves the planning

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
problem at positive weights,
but claim by contradiction

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's not on
the Pareto frontier.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it's on the Pareto
frontier, we can dominate.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a U prime vector,
which is no worse for all i

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and strictly better for j.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:84%
But since the lambda weights
are strictly positive,

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.610 align:middle line:84%
we've now found a new
vector, the prime vector,

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
such that the weighted
average of the prime utilities

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is strictly greater than
the weighted average

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:90%
of the starting point.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Hence, in more cryptic
notation, the dot product

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
lambda U is strictly
greater than lambda U star,

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
but we started with
the claim that we've

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:90%
got a solution to seven.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And we just found
a feasible solution

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:84%
to seven, which gives a
higher welfare number.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's a contradiction.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:90%
You with me so far?

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the
utility possibility

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
set is convex and closed,
and take some solution U

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
star, which is on the Pareto
frontier and, hence, Pareto

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:90%
optimal.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a vector U star,
which is Pareto optimal.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be on the boundary.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And because it's on the boundary
of the utility possibility set,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:84%
in turn is convex, we can
apply something called--

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you
this momentarily--

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the supporting
hyperplane theorem, which

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is going to give us, guarantee
the existence of, a lambda

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
vector such that at that
lambda, lambda dot U star,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is strictly greater than
lambda U for any other U

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:90%
in the utility possibility set.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, lambda star at
lambda, the particular lambda,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:84%
lambda star U, is
the highest possible,

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
cannot be dominated by
in some senses weakly,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
the highest possible lambda
weighted utility that you can

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.610 align:middle line:84%
get running over all possible
other feasible utilities

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:90%
in the utility possibility set.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:84%
That means that U star is
a solution to the planning

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.090 align:middle line:90%
problem by definition.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So that completes the
proof of going both ways,

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
but it kind of begs
the issue of what

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the heck is this supporting
hyperplane theorem.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So let me show
you some pictures.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is, along the way,
an extremely useful tool.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
It's just the first time
that we've needed it.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here's the
utility possibility set.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.659 align:middle line:84%
Here's the U star
that we picked.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It's on the Pareto frontier,
so it's Pareto optimal.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And that theorem is
true, so I should

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:84%
be able to find some lambda
weight such that, when

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I maximize the lambda
weighted sum of utilities,

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I would be at a
maximum at U star,

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
which visually you
can see is true.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There are other points
that are Pareto optimal,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
but they would not be maximal
under the lambdas, which

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
are implicitly the
slope of this red line.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:90%
These are level curves.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
We could call them
iso-welfare curves.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
These are level curves
of the social planner

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:84%
at particular lambda
weights lambda.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of tradition
to denote the slope

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:84%
by a line, which is right
angled to the line in question.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So this lambda going
up this way is just

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
a way to say that the
slope of both the Pareto

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
frontier and the
iso-welfare curve

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:84%
are the same and equal to
lambda 1 over lambda 2.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's a
picture of why it's true

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that, when you pick a point
on the Pareto frontier,

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:84%
you can find lambdas
which makes it

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:84%
a solution to the
programming problem.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:90%
What is this hyperplane?

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.090 align:middle line:90%
So we'll do everything in R2.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's a line in R2.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And in higher dimensions,
this is called

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:90%
a hyperplane, fancy language.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
You could probably draw
it as a plane in R3.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It gets harder to draw,
unless you're better

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.495 align:middle line:90%
than I am, in R4 and so on.

00:36:16.495 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:90%
But we'll stick to R2.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
So here's a line.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It's called a hyperplane.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can obviously
talk about the half space

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
above the line and the
half space below the line.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So above the line means, if
we specify the intercept c

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and the slope p then
the sets above the line,

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
the half space above,
is a set of all values z

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
which gives no lower value than
c at slopes p and vice versa

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:90%
for the lower half space.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's another line that
separates these two sets.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We could call one of these
set A and the other one

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:84%
set B. Note that they
are both convex sets.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Pick a set.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Pick the pink one,
pick any two points,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:84%
then weighted average
of those points

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
are, in turn, in the set.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a separating
line in the sense

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that the half space
above this line

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:84%
contains the pink convex
set is contained in that.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's within the
half space above.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And the blue convex set is
part of the half space below.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
this stuff up here says.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the culmination
of this is called

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:90%
the supporting hyperplane.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So again, we run
from hyperplanes

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to separating hyperplane theorem
having to do with convex sets

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to supporting
hyperplane theorem.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So this pick this set
B. And let's require

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.500 align:middle line:90%
that it be a convex set.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Pick this point x in the
set and on the boundary.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Then the claim is we
can find a hyperplane,

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.140 align:middle line:84%
in particular a supporting
hyperplane, which

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
just touches the
set B at x and is

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.820 align:middle line:90%
tangent to the boundary at x.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you with me?

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So the slopes of this
hyperplane are determined by p.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need a
constant c anymore.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:84%
This is said to be a supporting
hyperplane in the sense

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that, if you picked any
other x in the interior other

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:84%
than the one on the boundary,
any other y in this case

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
notation, it will have

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:90%
a return which is less than--

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.550 align:middle line:84%
p dot y will be
less than p dot x.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we were
using a moment ago, this

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:90%
separating hyperplane theorem.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I kind of asserted
we could draw this picture,

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and it seems really natural
that we ought to be able to.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It is using the convexity of
the utility possibility set

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and picking a point, like
x was three slides away,

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and then drawing this
hyperplane which is tangent.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And the separating
hyperplane theorem

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
says we can always do that
under these weak assumptions

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:90%
like convexity.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.110 align:middle line:84%
That also means we can
pick another one, right?

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.330 align:middle line:84%
If we pick another
point on the frontier,

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
we can find a
separating hyperplane.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's clearly, in
this diagram at least,

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.810 align:middle line:90%
going to have a different slope.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:90%
So we can support it.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to have
to change the lambdas.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's going on here.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:90%
This was the initial point.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:84%
We could have picked
another point.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:84%
If we did that, we'd
have to find new slopes

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:84%
for the supporting hyperplane,
so that it would kind of pivot

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to be tangent at
this new predetermined point.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, not to
get lost, this is

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.700 align:middle line:84%
how we're going back
and forth between Pareto

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
optimal allocations, which
are on the Pareto frontier,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and finding a lambda such
that at those lambdas

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.150 align:middle line:84%
we would be maximizing a
linear welfare function.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And any Pareto optimal point
which is on the boundary

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.910 align:middle line:90%
has to have that property.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the
first part, which

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
was anything that is maximal
under the welfare function,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:90%
must also be Pareto optimal.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the proof there that we
did was by contradiction.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:84%
All right, so in
notation, we can

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.270 align:middle line:84%
parameterize Pareto
optimal allocations

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:90%
by choosing Pareto weights.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And this lambda and delta sort
of means there in the simplex,

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
which, again, without
loss of generality,

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the lambdas are non-negative
and they add up to 1.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We used simplex
earlier for lotteries.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Here's the second time
that we're using it.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if we want to maximize a
particular lambda weighted sum

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of utilities, lambda
i weighting Ui,

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.520 align:middle line:84%
we can do that and
find the maximum to it

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and call the solution
X star and Y star.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But here, we're
going to earmark them

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:84%
by lambda because it was a
solution at particular lambdas.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.830 align:middle line:84%
This is just a repeat of
consumption and production

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:90%
sets and feasibility.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So any solution that maximizes
we earmark by lambda, this

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.080 align:middle line:90%
is a particular Pareto optimum.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, given any
Pareto optimal allocation,

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
we can find a lambda
which makes it a solution.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
restating in words

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.920 align:middle line:90%
what we already determined.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So the task of finding
Pareto optimal allocations

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Edgeworth box is simply
solving this math problem.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.330 align:middle line:90%
So let's apply it.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we had this date
space with uncertainty

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and this sort of, Debreu
tree about the set

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:84%
of possible outcomes at
date 1, date 2, and date 3.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
index consumption

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.780 align:middle line:84%
by the history of
all shocks leading up

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:90%
to that particular date.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And this was expected utility.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is a review slide.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
We went over this last
time or at least earlier--

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.710 align:middle line:84%
not last time, but
the time before that.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's determine an
optimal allocation of risk

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
in this economy that has
states determined at random.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to want to--
let me say it in words.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to maximize a lambda
weighted sum of utility subject

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:90%
to resource constraints.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.892 align:middle line:84%
Note we're not going to do
this in the space of utilities.

00:42:03.892 --> 00:42:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do it in
the space of underlying

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:84%
allocations, but
it's the same thing.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going
from allocations

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.397 align:middle line:84%
to utilities and from
utilities to maximizing

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
a lambda weighted sum,
we'll just kind of directly

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
search over the
underlying allocations.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:90%
It's small typeset.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You may be squinting
to try to see this.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Here was a repeat from the
previous slide, the utility

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.620 align:middle line:84%
function, with a
little more notation.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is expected
utility as we

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:84%
studied in the second lecture
on preferences and utility.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:41.040 align:middle line:84%
This counted by beta, as we kind
of did in the storage problem,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and weighting outcomes
by probabilities.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The summation here is over
all dates and all states,

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.760 align:middle line:90%
as in this tree.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we take those
expected utility outcomes

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and pre-multiply by
the lambda weights,

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:90%
as we've now been trained to do.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
not in utility space

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're in space of
underlying allocations,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.270 align:middle line:84%
we have to make sure
that consumptions add up

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:90%
to the total.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's, again, a bit
of a switch of notation.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:90%
These Y's are now--

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.950 align:middle line:84%
these right-hand sides are
using the Y for endowment, not

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.180 align:middle line:90%
for production.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's not that misleading.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have an exogenously
given set of endowments

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.660 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
data and the state.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And then consumption
has to add up to that

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.670 align:middle line:84%
or certainly could not be
greater than that because it

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:90%
would not be feasible.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So we call this
the Pareto problem

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
or the planner's problem
for, here, particular weights

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:90%
lambda.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.100 align:middle line:84%
What does the
solution look like?

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me tell you
intuitively what's going on,

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and then we can generalize it.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to maximize
the lambda weighted sum

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:90%
of expected utilities.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.990 align:middle line:84%
All I've done here is pull out
in front of those expressions

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the thing that is common
across all the agents i,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:84%
namely the beta and
the probabilities.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's the
same expression.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But maximizing one is equivalent
to maximizing the other

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because this is just
some scalar constant.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
consumptions are

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:84%
going to add up to the total
social endowment, which

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.160 align:middle line:84%
is the sum of individual
incomes, which

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:84%
was I think I forgot to mention
at the bottom of this slide.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the aggregate.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Social endowment is just the sum
of the individual endowments.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of dates
and lots of states,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
but for every date
and state there's

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:90%
a particular social endowment.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So we can simplify this so that
it looks like a static problem.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We can maximize each
component one at a time

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and just respect the
resource constraint.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:84%
In the objective function,
a component one at a time

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is just the lambda
weighted sum of utilities.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And this would be the
resource constraint

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that consumptions have
to add up appropriately.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So amazingly, we've sort of
been able to abstract away

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:84%
from dates and states and about
to determine an optimal risk

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.780 align:middle line:84%
sharing rule as long
as we keep track

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.480 align:middle line:84%
of the aggregate
social endowment.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:84%
All right, so another tool we
can use that you already know

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:90%
is the Lagrangian.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So we'll maximize this lambda
weighted sum of expected

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:84%
utilities, and we'll
throw in the constraint

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
sets with Lagrange multipliers
where y is greater than

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and is going to end up
being equal to the sum

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:90%
of consumptions.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So these thetas are the
quote, "Lagrange multipliers."

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of
them as shadow prices,

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:84%
like the marginal
utility of income.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are lots
of them because we

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.380 align:middle line:84%
have a theta for every possible
date and all possible histories

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of states leading
up to that date.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So there's a large number.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, max away, we get,
for a particular date

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and a particular
set of states, st.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.730 align:middle line:84%
We have the derivative of the
utility function with respect

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to its argument preceded
by beta and lambda.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So we get this
thing, theta to the t

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's at beta t
on the left-hand side.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And on the right-hand side, we
get-- where else does it enter?

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So we pick up the
Lagrange multiplier.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And then this is just a
repeat of the constraints.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You could write it
out more formally

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.670 align:middle line:84%
with theta times the
sum being 0 and so on,

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is
implicitly assuming

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that more is preferred to
less, resources are scarce.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
throw anything away.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
These first order conditions
look like lambda times

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.400 align:middle line:84%
the marginal utility of
consumption for household 1

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is equal to lambda i times the
marginal utility of consumption

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.370 align:middle line:90%
for all other households i.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is true
overall, for every i.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And this characterizes
solution for all possible dates

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and states where the
aggregate social endowment is

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:90%
a parameter.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So there are how
many households?

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Capital I. So we have I
minus 1 equations here.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.470 align:middle line:84%
We pick up one
more equation here.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We can solve this thing
and denote the consumption

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.480 align:middle line:84%
of household I to
be some function

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.990 align:middle line:84%
g of the aggregate
social endowment.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a Pareto
optimal allocation.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.450 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly a
subset of the set

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of all feasible
allocations, and it

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.730 align:middle line:84%
has to do with these weighted
marginal utilities being

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.060 align:middle line:84%
equated at particular
lambda weights.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Because utility
functions are concave,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:84%
strictly concave, if they
were strictly concave,

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:84%
then this g is
going to be positive

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.980 align:middle line:90%
with a positive derivative.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a monotonicity
argument here

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that, if the aggregate
social endowment is going up,

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:47.710 align:middle line:84%
then the consumptions of
all the agents are going up.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.880 align:middle line:84%
How fast they go up as the
social endowment goes up

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:90%
is a function of the g.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And the g has an i on it.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.320 align:middle line:84%
That i reflects potential
heterogeneity in the underlying

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:90%
utility functions.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:84%
We did not require that
everyone has the same utility

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.390 align:middle line:84%
levels or even the
same utility functions.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you some
solutions momentarily.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So we'll eventually get to an
application, risk and insurance

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:84%
in village India and
then one with production.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We will rederive this
equation and use it.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But the restrictions on the data
come from equations like 17.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember, economic science
is about making predictions.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So we have a whole economy.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Feasibility is one way to
restrict the prediction.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Optimality is a further
restriction on the prediction.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a criterion function,
a metric we're going to use.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We're now in the position
to make predictions

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.120 align:middle line:84%
about what allocations
ought to look like at least

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.070 align:middle line:90%
in this risk sharing setting.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
satisfy equation seven.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots of things that
are inconsistent with equation

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.430 align:middle line:90%
seven.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And that creates a test.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We can go to an actual
application and start testing.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
you two examples.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.210 align:middle line:84%
If we started with constant
absolute risk aversion--

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and that concept
was introduced when

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:84%
we talked about choice under
uncertainty under the consumer

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.020 align:middle line:90%
preferences.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of negative
exponential, which makes

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.910 align:middle line:90%
the margin utility positive.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.670 align:middle line:84%
This gamma j, which
is a weighting term,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is close to absolute
risk aversion.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, 1 over gamma
j is risk aversion.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The higher this gamma j
here, lower this thing is.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So gamma j itself is the
inverse of risk aversion.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like risk tolerance.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'll spare you the algebra.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you maximized a lambda
weighted sum of utilities

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:84%
subject to the aggregate
social endowment being e,

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:90%
you would get this solution.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is saying
consumption of household 1

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is a linear function
of the endowment.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the intercept,
and this is the slope.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The intercept has to do
with those lambda weights.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So very naturally, in this
case, the higher is lambda 1,

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:84%
then the higher is
the log of this ratio.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And the higher will be the level
of consumption of household 1.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing left
is how those consumptions

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:84%
will change as we change the
aggregate social endowment

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.080 align:middle line:84%
determined over time or
randomly or whatever.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying that
consumption of household 1

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.960 align:middle line:84%
will go up with e
at a faster rate.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And for household 2, the higher
is gamma 1 relative to gamma 2.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Gamma 1, as I said, is
like risk tolerance.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the inverse
of risk aversion.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're introducing
some randomness

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.150 align:middle line:90%
in the economy's GDP.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is, who's
going to bear that risk?

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
suffer in recessions?

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to bear the
bonus of being in a boom?

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:90%
We have risk aversion.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So the guy that's most risk
averse with the 1 over gamma

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:53.310 align:middle line:84%
would be the one where
this is close to 0,

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning that his
concerns over consumption

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.730 align:middle line:84%
is pretty stable against the
aggregate social endowment.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy is
bearing all the risk,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.530 align:middle line:84%
but that's a Pareto
optimal allocation.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
The riskiest person
should bear the brunt

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of the aggregate fluctuations.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.650 align:middle line:84%
This is constant relative
risk aversion, a version

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:90%
of which you saw before.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to raise
consumption to the power d.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.020 align:middle line:84%
This is actually consumption
over and above subsistence,

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:90%
as here.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So the consumption set has
a positive lower bound.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is the distance from
that subsistence consumption

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.890 align:middle line:90%
raised to the power d.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you solve these
equations, they're linear.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, you get an
intercept and a slope.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:84%
However, it's a bit
different from before

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
because the intercept contains
not only the lambda weights,

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.960 align:middle line:84%
but it contains the a thing,
which is related to the b,

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:84%
related to the power in
the utility function.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:58.507 align:middle line:84%
It looks like higher lambda
is going to lower consumption,

00:51:58.507 --> 00:52:00.090 align:middle line:84%
but then you've got
to remember lambda

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.020 align:middle line:90%
is a number between 0 and 1.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We're taking it to a power so
you can make it smaller instead

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.110 align:middle line:90%
of bigger, et cetera.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you do it right
and think about it,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.540 align:middle line:84%
it does mean that higher
lambda 1 is associated

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
with higher levels
of consumption,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:17.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's weighted,
effectively, by risk aversion

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and by the subsistence
level of consumption.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, if we vary the
aggregate social endowment,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.000 align:middle line:84%
the allocations will
change, but they're not

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.150 align:middle line:84%
going to go up 1 to 1
the way they did before.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.930 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be determined by
both the lambda weights as well

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:90%
as risk aversion.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Both those pictures, constant
absolute risk aversion

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and constant relative
risk aversion,

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.540 align:middle line:84%
look like this with
different slopes

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and different intercepts.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And then this is--

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not and I probably should
have written out the underlying

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.420 align:middle line:90%
utility functions.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But you can think of
this as one person having

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:84%
constant relative risk
aversion, the other one having

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.100 align:middle line:90%
constant absolute risk aversion.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
non-linear schedules,

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:84%
but they are both monotone
increasing as predicted.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But now, the slopes vary and
the levels are clearly different

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:84%
depending on the aggregate
social endowment e.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But we can still put
restrictions on the data.

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So those are three pictures.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to come
back to these pictures

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
when we do one of the
applications, which is dividing

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.040 align:middle line:90%
up land in medieval England.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.660 align:middle line:84%
We've referred to
the several times.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We're actually now
empowered with the tools

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to analyze
that application.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.300 align:middle line:90%
All right, are there questions?

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So again, next Thursday
we're going to not

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.130 align:middle line:90%
have another new lecture.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a review
session over the first seven

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:90%
of them, including this one.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So review the material, take
advantage of the opportunity.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Feel free to ask
me questions, and I

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.300 align:middle line:84%
will try to provide
a summary of what

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:90%
we've done so far in the class.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you very much.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:09.308 align:middle line:90%

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning,
all.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.
I hope you guys did not spend

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all of last night celebrating
the Red Sox victory,
And today we will take the next

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but there is one more tonight.
OK.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's see.
I trust the quiz went OK.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What I will do today is take
off from where we left off on

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Tuesday.
And continue our discussion of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the large signal and small
signal analysis of our

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
amplifier.
Today the focus will be on

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
"Small Signal Analysis".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So let me start by reviewing
some of the material.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And, as you know,
our MOSFET amplifier looks like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
this.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One of the things you will
notice in circuits,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
as I have been mentioning all
along in this course,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is that certain kinds of
patterns keep repeating time and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
time again.
And this is one such pattern.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
A three terminal device like
the MOSFET with an input and the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
drain to source port connected
to RL and VS in series in the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
following manner,
this is a very common pattern.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There are several other common
patterns.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The voltage divider is a common
pattern.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We keep running into that again
and again and again.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The Thevenin form,
a voltage source in series with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the resistor is another very
common form.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The Norton equivalent form,
which is a current source in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
parallel with a resistor is also
very common.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And it behooves all of us to be
very familiar with the analyses

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of these things.
Voltage dividers in particular

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
are just so common that you need
to be able to look at it and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
boom, be able to write down the
expression for voltage dividers.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I would also encourage you to
go and look at current dividers.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
When you have two resistors in
parallel and you have some

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
current flowing into the
resistors to find out the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
current in one branch versus the
other very quickly.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The expression is very
analogous to the voltage divider

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
expression.
And some of these very common

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
patterns are highlighted in the
summary pages in the course

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
notes, so it is good to keep
track of those and be extremely

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
familiar with those patterns to
the point where if you see it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you should be able to jump up
and shout out the answer just by

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
looking at it without having to
do any math.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So here was an amplifier.
And then we noticed that when

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the MOSFET was in saturation it
behaved like a current source.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And this circuit would give us
amplification while the MOSFET

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
was in saturation.
So we agreed to adhere to the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
saturation discipline which
simply said that I was going to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
use my circuit in a way that the
MOSFET would always remain in

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
saturation in building things
like amplifiers and so on.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And by doing that throughout
the analysis I could make the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
assumption that the MOSFET was
in saturation.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I didn't have to go through --
Analysis became easier.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I didn't have to figure out
now, what region is the MOSFET

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in?
Well, because of my discipline

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
it is always going to be in
saturation.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But in turn what we had to do
was conduct a large signal

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
analysis.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Again, in follow on courses you
will be given circuits like

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
this.
In fact, this very circuit with

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
a very high likelihood.
And you will be looking at more

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
complicated models of the
MOSFET.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Or you will be given the MOSFET
like this and,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
let's say in that course the
designers do not adhere to the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
saturation discipline,
in which case you have to first

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
figure out is my MOSFET in its
triode region or in the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
saturation region?
And depending on the region it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is in you have to apply
different equations.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So it is one step more
complicated than in 002.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In 002 we simplified our lives
by following a discipline.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And let me tell you that
following a discipline is quite

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
OK.
When it simplifies our lives

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and we can do good things with
it, it is quite OK to do that.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We are not wimps or anything
like that.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It is quite OK to have a
discipline and agree that we are

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
going to play in this region of
the playground and build

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
circuits in that manner.
By doing so,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
we could assume the MOSFET was
in saturation all the time.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And analysis simply used a
current source model.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
By the same token,
what becomes important is to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
figure out what are the
boundaries of valid operation of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the MOSFET in saturation?
To do that we conducted a large

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
signal analysis.
And it had two components to

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
it.
One of course was to figure out

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the output versus input
response.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And what this usually does is
that it does a nonlinear

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
analysis of this circuit.
If it is a linear circuit it is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
a linear analysis.
And figures out what the values

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of the various voltages and
currents are in the circuit as a

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
function of the applied inputs
and chosen parameters.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And the second step we said was
to figure out valid operating

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
ranges --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
-- for input and corresponding
ranges for the other dependent

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
parameters such as VO.
You could also find out the

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
corresponding operating range
for the current IDS and so on.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So by doing this you could
first analyze the circuit,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
find out the "bias" parameters,
find out the values of VI and

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
VO and so on.
And then you could say all

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
right, provided,
as long as VI stays within

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
these bounds my assumption that
this is in saturation will hold

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and everything will be fine.
The reading for this is Chapter

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
step and revisit small signal
analysis.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In the demo that I showed you
at the end of last lecture,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I showed you an input
triangular wave.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And the input triangular wave
gave rise to an output.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And we noticed that we did have
amplification,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I had a small input and a much
bigger output.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I did have amplification when
the MOSFET was in saturation but

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
it was highly nonlinear.
The input was a triangular wave

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and the output was some funny,
it kind of looked like a

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
sinusoid whose extremities had
been whacked down and kind of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
flattened.
And its upward going peak had

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
been shrunk.
So it was a kind of weird

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
nonlinear behavior.
I will show that to you again

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
later on.
And so it amplified but it was

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
nonlinear.
And remember our goal of two

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
weeks ago?
We set out to build a linear

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
amplifier.
So today we will walk down that

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
path and talk about building a
linear amplifier.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So to very quickly revisit the
input versus output

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
characteristic,
VI versus VO,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
this is VT and this is VS,
this is what things looked

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
like.
Also to quickly review the

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
valid ranges,
until some point here the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
amplifier was in saturation,
the MOSFET was in saturation

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and somewhere here I had VO
being equal to VI minus a

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
threshold drop.
At that point the MOSFET went

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
into its triode region and I no
longer was following the

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
saturation discipline.
So therefore this is my valid

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
region of operation.
We also know that the output

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
was given by VS minus K (VI-VT)
all squared RL over 2.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Again assuming the MOSFET is in
saturation.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It is very important to keep
stating this because this is

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
true only when the MOSFET is in
saturation, when I am following

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the discipline.
Notice that this is a nonlinear

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
relationship.
So VO depends on some funny

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
square law dependence on VI.
The key here is how do we go

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
about building our amplifier?
Take a look at this point here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
At this point here let's say I
have a VI input.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Corresponding output is VO.
Focus is this point.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And left to itself this was a
nonlinear curve.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Remember the trick that we used
in our nonlinear Expo Dweeb

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
example?
We used the Zen Method.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Remember the Zen Method?
We said look,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
this is nonlinear,
but if you can focus your mind

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
on this little piece of the
curve here this looks more or

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
less linear.
If I look at a small itty-bitty

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
portion of the curve and I do
the Zen thing,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and kind of zoom in on here.
This looked more or less

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
linear.
This means that if I could work

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
with very small signals and
apply the signal in a way that I

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
also had a DC offset of some
sort.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Then I would be in a region of
the curve, I would be

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
delineating a small region of
the curve which would be more or

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
less linear.
This was a small signal trick.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And what we will do here is
simply revisit the small signal

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
model.
Most of what I am going to do

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
from here on will be more or
less a repeat of what you saw

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
for the light emitting expo
dweeb.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Just that here I have a three
terminal device,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
with a little bit more
complication.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
The equation is different.
I don't have to resort to a

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Taylor series expansion.
I will just do a complete

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
expansion of this expression and
develop the small signal values

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
for you.
Recall the small signal model.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It had the following steps.
The first step will operate at

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
some bias point,
VI, VO, and of course some

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
corresponding point IDS.
This is Page 3.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And then superimpose a small
signal VI on top of the big fat

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
bias.
Remember the "boost"?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So VI is the boost.
Boom.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And above VI,
I have small signal VI that I

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
apply.
And our claim is that response

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of the amplifier to VI is
approximately linear.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
The key trick with this is that
for my small signal model here,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
this is Page 3 here,
and Page 2.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The key trick here is that with
the small signal model,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I operate my amplifier at some
operating point,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
VO, VI.
I superimpose a small signal VI

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
on top of small VI on top of big
VI.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And then I claim that the
response to VI is approximately

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
linear.
And let me just embellish that

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
curve a little bit more.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Notice that in this situation
this was my VI,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
which is my bias voltage,
this is VO, which is the output

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
bias, and of course not shown on
this graph is the output

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000
operating current which is IDS.
One nice way of thinking about

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
this is to redraw this and think
that your coordinate axes have

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
kind of shifted in the following
manner.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
This is VI.
This is also on your Page 3.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This is VT.
Remember this was the operating

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
point, VO and VI.
And notice that we were

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000
operating in this small regime
of our transfer curve here.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And in effect what we are
saying is that I am going to

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
apply small variations about VI
and call those variations delta

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
VI or small VI.
And the resulting variations

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
are going to look like delta VO.
Also referred to as small V,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
small O.
So I will have small variations

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
here.
And they give rise to

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
corresponding small variations
there.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
One way to view this is as if
we are working with a new

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
coordinate system.
Another way to view this is

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that so the capital VI and
capital VO correspond to my VI

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and VO as the total voltages in
my circuit, but at this bias

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
point I can think of another
coordinate system here with

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
small VI and VO out there.
And for small changes to VI,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I can figure out the
corresponding small changes to

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
VO.
Just that all the analysis I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
perform here is going to be
linear.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And I will prove it to you in a
couple of different ways in the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
next few seconds.
When I am doing small signal

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
analysis I am operating here in
this regime at some bias point.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
You have also seen this before.
How do I get a bias?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
This is my amplifier RL and VS.
This is Page 4.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
VO.
The way I get a bias is I apply

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
some DC voltage VI and
superimpose on top of that my

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
small signal small VI.
This is my DC bias that has

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
boosted up the signal to an
interesting value.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And because of that what I can
get is by varying VI as a small

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
signal with a very small
amplitude, I am going to get a

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
linear response here.
And I can draw that for you as

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
well.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
This is my bias point here.
And if I vary my signal like so

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
then my output should look like
this.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
This is point VI,
this is point VO,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and this is my small signal VI
and this is my small signal VO

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and this is capital VO.
So this small thing here is VI.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I would like to show you a
little demo.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I will start with the same demo
I showed you the last time.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I showed you the amplifier.
In the demo I am going to apply

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
a triangular wave.
And initially I start with a

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
large signal.
And you will see that the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
output looks really corny,
is going to look something like

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
this.
That's large signal response.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And then I will begin playing
with the input making it

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
smaller, and you can see how it
looks yourselves.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
There you go.
So this is where I stopped the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
last time.
The last lecture I applied this

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
input, time is going to the
right, and the purple curve in

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the background is the output.
It looks much more like a

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
sinusoid with some flattening of
its tips.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Nothing like an interesting
triangular wave.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
What I will do next is that let
me make sure I have enough of a

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
boost here, enough of a DC
voltage so that I am operating

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
at some point here.
I believe I already have that.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Notice that I can shift up the
triangular wave input,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
or I can shift it down.
So let me bias it here.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I have chosen a VI that's
about, I forget how many volts

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
per division it is,
but I have chosen some VI here.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And I biased it such that this
is the input.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
You get a nonlinear response.
It is amplified.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It is much bigger.
What I will do next is make VI

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
that I apply smaller and
smaller.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I have already done the
boosting.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Boom, that's a boost.
So I have boosted up your VI

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
already.
Next is I am going to shrink

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
it, and hopefully you will see
that if all that I am saying is

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
truthful here you will see a
triangular response.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Let's go try it out.
Watch the yellow.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I am going to shrink the yellow
and make it smaller and smaller.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
There you go.
It is great when nature works

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
like you expect it to.
I have never seen a triangular

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
wave looks so pretty in my life.
It is awesome.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Look at this.
Here is a tiny triangular wave.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And the output is also a
triangular wave but it is much

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
more linear.
Yes.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Question?
What's that?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
The question is that the output
here is only as big as the input

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
used to be before.
That's a good question.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
What I have done here is I am
showing you a laboratory

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
experiment.
And let's assume that this

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
input is the input I am getting
from some sensor in the field.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Assume that this is my input,
not what I had before.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Assume that this is my input to
begin with and this is the

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
amplified output.
What I can also do is I can

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
also change the bias.
And we will see this at the end

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
of the lecture,
in the last ten minutes of

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
lecture.
How do you select a bias point?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
By changing your bias point you
can change the properties of an

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
amplifier to give you a preview
of upcoming attractions.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Let me ask you,
what do you think should happen

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
if I change the bias point?
I have not shown you the math

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
yet, so intuitively what do you
think should happen?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
If I increase the bias what do
you think is going to happen?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Yes.
Good insight.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Higher bias will be more
amplification.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Let's see if our friend is
correct.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Let me set a higher bias.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Not necessarily,
I guess.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You're actually right,
by the way.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I am playing a trick on
everybody here.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
As I change my input bias.
Notice that under certain

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
conditions my output becomes
smaller and gets more distorted.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Under other conditions what is
going to happen to my output is

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
that it is becoming smaller and
is going to get distorted again.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So there are a bunch of funny
effects happening that reflect

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
on the bias point,
but for an appropriate choice

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
of bias point as I increase the
bias the amplification should

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
increase.
And I will show you that in a

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
few minutes.
But it is a complicated

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
relationship.
Yes.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
This is finally getting fun.
Here is the question.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Professor Agarwal,
we love your song and dance,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
but if you really want to get a
high signal at the output and

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
you want to amplify your big
input signal how do you do it?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So the question is let's say I
have an input that is this big

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
here, if it is this big,
I have shown you how I can get

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
things that are this big,
but what if my input was this

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
big?
How do I get an output that is

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
this big?
Well, I will use one of those

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
learned by questioning methods
and have you tell me the answer.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Someone tell me the answer.
How do I do that?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Yes.
Use another amplifier.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So the answer is I will use one
amplifier to go from here to

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
here.
And the suggestion is use

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
another amplifier to go from
here to here.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And, in fact,
I believe that you may have a

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
problem in your problem set
where you will do that.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And so you have only yourselves
to blame.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
So how do you make this work?
What you have to do is this VI

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
has to be much smaller than the
bias point VI on this one.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I have to build a different
amplifier, choose a different

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
set of parameters such that VI
prime, which is the VI for this

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
guy, is much less than V capital
I prime for this guy.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
It's a design question.
You need to design it in a way

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
that the signals of interest
need to be much smaller than the

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
bias voltage of this amplifier.
So you may have to use much

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
higher supply voltages.
My amplifier,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I believe, has a 4 volt supply
or 5 volt supply.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
You might have to use an
amplifier with a much bigger

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
supply, different values of RL
and so on.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And I know that the course
notes also have some exercises

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and problem sets that discuss
that in more detail.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Yes.
This is even more fun.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
The question is,
good question.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
The question is why do you need
this guy here?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Just use this guy,
right?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Why do you need this guy?
Big guys rule,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
right?
Who needs the little guys?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Well, let me use the Socratic
method again.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Why don't you give me the
answer?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
You guys are smart.
Why do you need little guys?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Why do you need the small guy
here?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Anybody with the answer?
Yeah.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The big guy may not be as
sensitive.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I like that.
You know what?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
He is almost correct.
I will show you why in a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
second.
Anything else?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Any other reason?
Yes.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Bingo.
That is another good answer.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
So let me address both the
answers.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
The answer given was that look,
this amplifier is amplifying

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
the signal by a certain amount,
by a factor of 7.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And I have designed this such
that this amplifies a signal by

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
a factor of maybe 10.
So in all I am getting an

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
amplification of 70.
This would be a great design

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
question for lab next year.
I give you a bunch of

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
components and ask you to design
an amplifier given the

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
constraints with the highest
amount of amplification.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
It turns out that when you
design your amplifier,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
in order to meet the saturation
discipline and so on,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
you have to choose values of RL
and VS and stuff like that and

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
be within power constraints so
the amplifier doesn't blow up

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
and stuff.
And by the end of it all you

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
are going to get a measly 7X
gain out of it.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
The same way here,
to be able to deal with a very

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
small signal here and get some
amplification,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
another set of values and you
get 10X.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
So they multiply.
It is much harder to build one

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
amplifier with a much larger
gain.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
You know what?
I just realized that we will be

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
looking at this in the last five
or seven minutes of lecture.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I am going to show you what the
amplification depends upon.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
It depends upon K.
It depends upon RL.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
It depends upon VI.
Now the question is I have had

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
all this time to think about how
to stitch in sensitive into

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
this, and I believe I can.
It turns out that when you have

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
large voltages and so on and you
have practical devices,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
it turns out that the more
current you pump through devices

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
they tend to produce noise of
various kinds.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
So very powerful amplifiers are
not very good at dealing with

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
really tiny signals because they
have some inherent noise

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
capabilities.
And so I guess that is

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
sensitive.
It is sensitive to noise.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Another question?
Yes.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Ask me the question again.
I didn't follow.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Let me just explain it.
It turns out that I will not be

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
able to pass this through the
big amplifier to begin with

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
because it is just going to give
me a gain of just a factor of 7.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
However, if I have a signal
that is this big to begin with

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
then I may just need this
amplifier.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I don't need the smaller guy.
If my signal was this big to

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
begin with, if I had a strong
sensor that produced a strong

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
signal to begin with,
yeah, I can deal with just a

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
single stage.
I don't need to two stages.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
It is all a matter of design.
And it is actually a fun design

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
exercise.
Given a budget,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
dollars, right?
You go to your supply room and

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
look at the parts that you have
and you go to build what you

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
have to build with the parts
that you have.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And so sometimes you need to
build two amplifiers to get the

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
gain or build a signal
amplifier.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
It's all a design thing.
All right.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Moving on to Page 7.
That brings us to the small

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
signal model.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Page 5.
What I showed you up on the

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
little demo was that provided
the signal input in this example

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
VI was much smaller than capital
VI out there as I shrank my

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
input, I was able to get a more
or less linear response at the

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
output.
And so to repeat my notation at

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
the input, the total input is a
sum of the operating point input

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
plus a small signal input.
This is called the total

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
variable.
This is called the DC bias.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
It is also called the operating
point voltage.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
And this is called my small
signal input.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:02.000
It is also variously called
incremental input.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
This is more a mathematical
term relating to incremental

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
analysis or perturbation
analysis.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So VI, call it small signal,
call it small perturbation,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
call it increment,
whatever you want.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Similarly, at the output I have
my total variable at the output

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
a sum of the output operating
voltage and the small signal

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
voltage.
I do not like using Os in

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
symbols because big O and small
O is simply a function of how

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
big you write them.
It is not super clear.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
And in terms of a graph,
let me plot the input and

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
output for you.
Let's say this is the total

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
input and that is the total
output.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I may have some bias VI.
And corresponding to that I may

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
have some bias VO.
Hold that thought for a second

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
while I give you a preview of
something that we will be

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
covering in about three or four
weeks.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Notice that as I couple
amplifiers together,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
the output operating point
voltage of this amplifier in

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
this connection becomes the
input operating point voltage of

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
this amplifier,
right?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
So when they connect this
output to this input,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
the output operating point
voltage becomes coupled to the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
input here so it becomes the
input operating point voltage

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
here.
Now I have a nightmare on my

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
hands.
As I adjust the bias of this

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
guy, the bias of this guy
changes, too.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
The two are dependent.
It is a pain in the neck.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And we being engineers find
ways to simplify our lives.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And you will learn another
trick in about three or four

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
weeks.
And that trick will let you

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
decouple these two stages in a
way that you can design this

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
stage in isolation,
go have a cup of coffee and

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
then come back to this stage and
design this stage in isolation.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
For those of you who want to
run ahead and think about how to

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
do it, think about it.
What trick can you use to get

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
them in isolation?
Moving on.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
What I would like to do next is
address this from a mathematical

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
point of view.
And much as I did for the light

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
emitting expo dweeb analyze this
mathematically and show you that

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
if VI is much smaller than
capital VI, I indeed get a

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
linear response.
This time around I won't use

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Taylor series because it turns
out that this expression can be

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
expanded fully.
So you don't have to buy into

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Taylor series and so on.
I am going to list everything

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
down for you.
We know, to begin with,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
that VO for the amplifier is
VS-RLK/2 (VI-VT)^2.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
What I am going to do for this,
much as I did for the LED,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
what I'm going to do is derive
for you the output as a function

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
of the input when the input VI
is very small.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
In other words,
when I substitute for VI,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
V capital I squared plus small
VI.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Much as I did for the expo
dweeb, I want to substitute for

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
VI a big DC VI.
So VI is much smaller than VI.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And show you for yourselves
that the output response,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
V small O is going to be
linearly connected to VI.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Notice that,
let me write another equation

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
here.
This is a total variable.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
This simply says that if the
input is VI then the output is

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
going to be VO,
which means that the operating

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
point input voltage should
satisfy this equation,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
correct?
In other words,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
the operating point output
voltage V capital O should equal

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
VS-RLK/2 (VI-VT)^2.
This is at VI equals capital

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
VI.
This is very simple but may

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
seem confusing.
All this is saying is that

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
look, this equation gives me the
relationship between VI and VO.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Therefore, if I apply capital
VI as the input,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I'm given that my corresponding
output is capital VO,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
so they must satisfy this
equation, right?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Those are bias point values and
that must satisfy this equation.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Simple.
I know that.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
So hold that thought.
Stash it away in the back of

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
your minds.
Now let me go through a bunch

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000
of grubby math and substitute
for VI in this expression here.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Let me go ahead and do that.
VS-RLK/2((VI+vi)-VT)^2.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
When I do something that is
other than math I will wake you

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
up.
I will just keep doing a bunch

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
of steps that are pure math.
No cheating.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
No nothing.
Watch my fingers.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
When I do anything that is not
obvious math I will wake you up.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Next I am going to simply move
VT over and rewrite this as

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
follows, RLK/2((VI-VT)+vi)^2.
Again, I haven't done anything

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
interesting so far.
I have just substituted this.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I am just juggling things
around just to pass away some

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
time, I guess.
All right.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Next what I am going to do is
simply expand this out and write

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:52.000
it this way RLK/2,
expand that out and treat this

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
as one unit VS -
RLK/2((VI-VT)^2+

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
2(VI-VT)vi+vi^2).
Nothing fancy here.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
This is like the honest board.
Nothing fancy here.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Standard stuff.
Only math.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
I will move to this blackboard
here where I do some fun EE

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
stuff.
Yes.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Good.
At least one person isn't

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
asleep here.
Thank you.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
So just math here.
Nothing fancy.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Plain old simple math.
I have not done any trickery.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
I still have all my ten
fingers.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Now what I am going to do,
now watch me.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I am not using Taylor series
here because this expression

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
lends itself to this analysis.
Notice VI squared here.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I made the assumption that VI
is much smaller than capital VI,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
so what I can do is assuming
that VT is small enough that VI

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
minus VT is still a big number
compared to small VI,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
what I can do is ignore this in
comparison to the capital VI

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
terms.
So I have a capital VI term

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
here.
I am going to ignore VI

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
squared.
So, for example,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
if capital VI was 5 volts and
small VI was 100 millivolts 0.1,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
so 0.1 squared is 0.01.
So it is comparing 0.01 to 5.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So I am off by a factor of 500.
So now watch me.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Now I begin playing some fun
and games here.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I eliminate this,
and because I eliminate that it

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:02.000
now becomes approximately equal.
What I do in addition is let me

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000
write down the output.
The total variable is the sum

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
of the DC bias and some
variation of the output.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And let me simply expand that
term and write it down again.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
VS-RLK/2(VI-VT)^2-RLK/2.
I get a two here.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
And I get VI-VT.
I won't forget the VI this

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
time.
Again, from here to there

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
nothing fancy.
This is the one step where I

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
have used a trick.
I have said small VI is much

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
smaller than capital VI,
and so I have simply expanded

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
this out and written it here.
So do you see the obvious next

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
trick here?
From star look at this guy.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
I can cancel this out from star
because I know that at the

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
operating point these two
expressions are equal,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000
and so therefore I can cancel
out the operating point voltage

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
and this.
What I am left with is small VO

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:45.000
is simply minus RLK(VI-VT) times
vi.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Only one place where I did
something funny.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Other than that it is purely
math.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So this is what I get.
Notice that this whole thing is

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
a constant, minus RLK(VI-VT).
This whole thing is a constant.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And so VO is equal to some
constant times VI.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Let me just define some terms
for you that you will use again

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
and again.
For reasons that will be

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
obvious next lecture,
I am going to call this term

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
here GM.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I am going to call this term a
constant, K(VI - VT).

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
It is a constant for a given
bias point voltage.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
So I am going to call that GM.
And then I am going to call

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
this whole thing A.
And of course this is VI.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
There you go.
I have my linear amplifier.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
A is the gain times small VI.
And the gain has these terms in

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
it.
I just call this GM.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
You will see why later.
But notice that the gain

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
relates to RL.
The size of the load resistor

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
RL, how big it is,
1K, 10K, whatever.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
K, this is a MOSFET parameter,
and VI minus VT.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
That is a constant for a given
bias point voltage and small VI.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
So VO equals small VI.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
I won't give you a graphical
interpretation,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
but I encourage you to go and
look at Figure 8.9 in the course

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
notes.
And it gives you a graphical

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
interpretation of that
expression.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Move to Page 7.
Another way of looking at this,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
another way of mathematically
analyzing it,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000
here I went through a full
blown expansion and pretty much

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
deriving the small signal
response.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
What I can also do is take a
shortcut here.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
So let me just give you the
shortcut.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000
You might find this handy.
VO=VS-KRL/2(VI-VT)^2.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And my shortcut is as follows.
My small signal response is

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
simply this relationship.
I find the slope at the point

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
capital VI and multiply by the
increment.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Slope times the increment gives
me the incremental change in VO

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
as follows.
d/dI (VS-KRL/2(VI-VT)^2)

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
evaluated at vI=VI times vi.
This is math again.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I want to find out the change
in VO for a small change in VI,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
and I do that by taking the
first derivative of this with

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:29.000
respect to VI substituting V
capital I and multiplying by the

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000
small change delta VI or small
VI.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000
So this is simply the slope of
the VO versus VI curve at VI.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And so therefore taking the
derivative here of this.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
This is a constant so it
vanishes.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
But twice 2 to cancel out,
so I get KRL(VI-VT) times small

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:06.000
vi evaluated at capital VI.
So I get twice KRL,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:18.000
VI evaluated at capital VI,
so it is VI minus VT times

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
small VI.
Same thing.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Oh, and I have a minus sign
here.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
I get the same expression that
I derived for you up there,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
and this is just taking the
slope and going with it.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And this, as I mentioned
before, this is A.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
The last few minutes let me
kind of pull everything together

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
and also hit upon something that
many of your questions are

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
touched upon.
And that all relates to how to

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
choose the bias point.
So here I have taken an

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
analysis approach.
When teaching we often teach

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
you are given something,
you analyze it,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
but as you begin to master it
you can begin to design things

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
where you can ask a lot of
questions and so on.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
And here what we have is an
analysis given a value of RLK,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
VI and so on.
How to choose the bias point

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
becomes more of a design issue.
If you are designing an

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
amplifier, you asked me the
question, how do I choose two

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
small amplifiers versus one big
amplifier, that sort of stuff?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
It boils down to how do you
choose the bias point?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
How do you choose VI?
How do you choose RL and so on?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
What I would like to do is
touch upon some of these things.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
First of all,
gain or the amplification.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
One of the most important
design perimeters for an

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
amplifier is what is the gain?
Let's say you get a job at

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Maxim Integrated Technologies,
and they say we would like you

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
to build a linear power
amplifier for cell phones.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
You can say I know how to do
that.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
And then they say the next
stage needs a 100 millivolt

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
input.
While this thing coming from

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
the antenna is only a few tens
or a few hundreds of a

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
microvolt.
So you sit down and say oh,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
my gosh, I need an
amplification of so much,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
and you go design an amplifier.
So gain tends to be a key

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
parameter.
And notice that gain is

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
proportional to RL.
It relates to VI minus VT,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
so proportional to VI.
It is also related to RL.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.000
The second point is the gain
point determines where I bias

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
something.
If I choose my bias too high I

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
get distortion,
or if I choose my bias too low

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
I get distortion.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
So depending on how I choose my
bias point, as a signal goes up

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
it may begin clipping or begin
distorting.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And I will show you a demo the
next time on that particular

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
example.
So bias point will determine

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
how big of a signal you can send
without getting too much

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
distortion.
And the other thing is that,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
relates to how big of an input,
what is a valid input range?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So let's say you have a signal.
And you want that signal to

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
have both positive and negative
excursions of the same value.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Then, depending on where you
choose a bias point,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
your input range may become
smaller or larger.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
And we will go through these in
the context of and amplifier and

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
look at some design issues in
the next lecture.

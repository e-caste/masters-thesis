00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.920
PROFESSOR: Economics--

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.510
oligopoly.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.390
Which is basically trying
to move towards the most

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.150
realistic modeling of
markets that we can.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.820
We've talked about two extreme
versions of modeling markets.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.610
One is perfect competition,
which is the extreme case of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490
perfect entry and exit.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.920
Free entry and exit.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.630
Perfect consumer information.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.950
An idealized market.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.810
We know that doesn't really
exist in practice anywhere.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.510
The second extreme was monopoly,
which we do see in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.880
practice in some places.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.140
In particular, when there's
natural monopolies.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.940
We do see that.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.520
But that's still doesn't
describe most markets.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.970
Most markets are better
described as oligopolies.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.160
These are markets where there's
more than one market

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.000
player, yet where each firm is
large enough to actually

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.430
affect the price.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.880
So an oligopoly market is where
there'll be a small

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.660
number of firms in the market
with substantial barriers to

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.190
entry from additional firms.
An oligopoly market where

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.300
there's a small number of firms
with enough barriers to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.960
entry that additional
firms don't enter.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.680
So the classic example
of an oligopoly

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.250
industry is the auto industry.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.000
Here's a market with a small
number of dominant players.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.200
There's been some entry and exit
over time, obviously, but

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.870
it moves pretty slowly.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.850
By and large it's a market
where there's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.780
very limited entry.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.110
And the question is, how do
firms behave in this market?

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.700
Obviously it's not like perfect
competition where they

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.750
can lazily take a price out of
the market and just produce

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.290
based on that price.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.199
But it's also not the same as
monopoly where they can just

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.639
get to set the price and
not worry about what

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.890
other people do.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.470
They're in this in-between
situation where they have

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.630
price setting power.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.220
They have some market power but
in a context where they

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.830
have to worry about
competitors.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.510
And so in this context there are
two different ways firms

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.450
can behave. It's important
to lay out to start.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.990
There's two different ways for
firms to behave. They can

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.130
behave cooperatively or
non-cooperatively.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.510
If they behave cooperatively
we say

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.046
that they form a cartel.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.110
So our cartel is what happens
when oligopolistic firms, when

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.450
firms in an oligopolistic market
behave cooperatively to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.220
determine the outcome.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.480
We call that a cartel.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.410
The classic example, of course,
here being OPEC.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.680
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.830
a cartel that drives
the price of oil.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.950
Those countries cooperate in how
much oil they produce to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.880
move the price up or
down according to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.930
what the group desires.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.170
And what cartels do is
essentially turn oligopolies

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.010
into monopolies.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.610
So what cartelization does, what
a cooperative equilibrium

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.380
does is essentially say, let's
all get together and behave as

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.905
if we're one big monopoly
by cooperating.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.320
And therefore, if you cooperate
you can get all the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.580
wonderful things monopolies get:
huge market power, huge

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.090
markets et cetera.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.760
But as we'll talk about next
time, it turns out to be

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.080
pretty hard to get a cooperative
oligopoly.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.870
There's lots of reasons why
it might fall apart.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.820
And that's why in most
oligopolistic markets firms

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.110
behave non cooperatively.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.160
In most oligopolistic markets
firms are behaving

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.490
non-cooperatively.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.360
They're competing with each
other, not cooperating.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.900
And that's what we're going to
spend today analyzing is the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.920
case of non-cooperative
oligopolies.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.820
Yeah?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.060
PROFESSOR: Depends
on the context.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.470
In the US, and I'll talk about
this, in the US there's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.860
anti-trust legislation which
can make it illegal in many

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.730
contexts to cooperate.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.600
Obviously OPEC is not subject
to some world legislation.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.490
But even in the US there can be
implicit cartelization and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.600
implicit cooperation, and
we'll talk about that.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.020
It's a good question.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.050
So technically you're right.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.890
Technically it is illegal in
the US in most contexts to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.470
form a cooperative,
to form a cartel.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.780
Whether in practice those laws
can be enforced is an

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.040
interesting, legitimate
question.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.050
So today we want to focus on
the case of non-cooperative

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.500
oligopolies.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.030
And to do so we're going
to turn to a new tool.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.440
And one of the fundamental tools
of economics in the last

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.370
30 years which is game theory.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.050
So today we're going to talk
about game theory.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.310
Game theory is a tool of
economics that was not really

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.640
used early in economics but
has come to dominate

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.210
theoretical economics over
the past 30 or 40 years.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.820
And basically the way that game
theory works is to think,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.790
literally, of oligopolistic
firms as engaging in a game.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.420
So when you play, don't want to
say play Monopoly, that's

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.980
confusing terms. When
you play Sorry!

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.200
or whatever with someone, or
play some online game with

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200
someone, you're competing
to win.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.240
You're behaving
non-cooperatively.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.250
You're competing to win.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.100
So basically what the insights
of game theory are that all

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.770
the tools we used strategically
to make

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.940
decisions in playing games can
actually be used in modeling

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.170
how firms compete
non-cooperatively in

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.420
oligopolistic market.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.010
The key insight is that each
firm will develop a strategy.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.370
Just as when you're playing
chess you have some strategy

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.420
going in, firms develop
a strategy.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.580
And that based on that strategy
they will determine

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.380
their behavior.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.470
And what is going to determine
that behavior is going to be

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.010
how firms' strategies combine to
determine a market outcome.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.910
When firms come in with
different strategies, or when

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.560
a bunch of firms with strategies
come in to compete

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.355
with each other, what determines
the market outcome.

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:53.790
And what that's going to depend
on is something we call

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.305
an equilibrium concept.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.080
Which is how do we measure--

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.610
essentially the equilibrium
concept is in game theory

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.750
terms, think about how
do we determine

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.490
when the game's over?

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.510
How do we determine when
we've decided on the

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.160
outcome of the market.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.260
What's the equilibrium
concept?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.170
So when you're reading the rules
of a new game the first

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.230
thing you look for is how
do you decide who wins.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.530
That's kind of like what the
equilibrium concept is.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.900
It's what determines whether
the game has ended.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.760
What determines whether you've
reached equilibrium.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.170
Where you've reached a point
where the market is stable and

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.650
therefore the game has ended.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.390
Not ended in the sense the firm
shut down, but ended in

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.390
the sense that you know what
everybody's doing.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.060
So it's not quite like
winning or losing.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.870
It's more just like what
determines when you're at the

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.490
point where that market
is at equilibrium.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.150
Now the most famous concept is
due to John Nash, who many of

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.900
you heard of from the movie and
book A Beautiful Mind, and

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.390
that's called the Nash
Equilibrium.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:07.850
A Nash equilibrium is the point
at which no firm wants

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.030
to change its strategy
given what the

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.900
other firms are doing.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.860
I'm going to say that again.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.030
A Nash equilibrium is the point
where no firm wants to

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.940
change its strategy given what
the other firms are doing.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.210
It's a little bit bizarre,
but we'll work it out.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:31.230
In other words, more formally,
the idea is that holding

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:38.169
constant, given the strategies
all your competitors use

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:43.390
there's nothing that I can do
to raise my profits further.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.640
Given the strategies all my
competitors are playing,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.080
there's no strategy I can choose
that will make me more

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.110
profitable than the
one I'm choosing.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.257
And likewise for every player
in the market that will turn

00:08:54.257 --> 00:08:54.930
out to be true.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.860
So have players sitting
around a game board,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.340
going around the circle.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.110
Each player says, given what I
know each of the rest you are

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.560
doing, I'm doing the
best thing I can.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.780
And they go around the circle
and everybody says, OK, I'm at

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.050
that point.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.580
You've reached a stable
Nash equilibrium.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.100
This was named, of course,
for John Nash.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.530
You all know the story
of John Nash.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.820
He was a famous, actually
mathematician.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.650
We use his tools in economics,
but he was a mathematician.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.770
Developed these incredible
theories, and then developed

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.920
schizophrenia, went crazy.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.010
But not before he developed
some of the most important

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.770
concepts in both mathematics
and economics.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.460
The most important is the
Nash equilibrium.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.170
Now the best illustration we use
of the Nash equilibrium is

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.680
an example that we refer to
as the prisoner's dilemma.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.920
And many of you will be familiar
with this from more

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.330
popular reading you've
done in economics.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.200
But let me just go through it
because it's important to

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.760
understand it.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.000
The prisoner's dilemma.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.960
The prisoner's dilemma the title
comes from the old way

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.370
they used to make
police movies.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.670
Where the idea is you catch
two guys at a crime.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.010
You can't put them away unless
one of them fesses up.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.680
So what you do is you put them
each a separate room.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.090
And you say to the one,
your buddy's cracked.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.890
He's going to he's going to
sell you down the river.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.610
You better, I'm using all my
'50s analogies, he's going to

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.010
put you away for good.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.530
But if you admit that he's
guilty and he did the crime,

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.980
we'll let you off with
a light sentence.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.660
Then they go to the other room
and say the same thing to the

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.490
other guy hoping they'll both
rat on each other and they'll

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.580
both get a sentence.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:46.360
So basically the idea is, let's
say that you walk into

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.030
each room and you say to each
person, look, we have enough

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.330
evidence right here, and you
show them, to send you each to

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.850
prison for a year.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.400
We would have enough evidence
to send you each to

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.970
prison for a year.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.450
But we aren't sure about
this other thing.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.980
If you'll admit that your friend
did this other thing,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.834
then he'll go for five years
and you'll go free.

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.700
And then we go to the friend
and say the same thing.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.360
If you'll admit that your friend
did the other thing

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.770
he'll go five years and
you'll go free.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:17.070
But if they both admit then they
both go for two years.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.980
So if they both admit, they
both go for two years.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.360
Now the way to write this
down, what we do here to

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.410
explain this, is we write down
what we call a payoff matrix.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.000
So write down a payoff matrix.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.640
So the idea is we have
prisoner A here

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.980
and prisoner B here.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.510
And they each have an option.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:43.300
They could remain silent
or they can talk.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.240
Silent or talk.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.370
Now if they both remain silent,
if they both say I

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.780
would never rat out my friend,
I'm happy to go to jail for a

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.910
year rather than rat out my
friend, then they each get one

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.950
year in jail.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.890
a equals 1, b equals 1.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:11.020
However if prisoner A rats out
his buddy and prisoner B

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.785
chooses not to rat out his
buddy, then A gets--

00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:21.360
so I'm sorry, if prisoner
A talks and

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.210
prisoner B remains silent.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.230
Prisoner A talks, prisoner B
remains silent, then A gets

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.050
zero but B get five
years in prison.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.520
On the other hand, if prisoner
B rats out his friend, but a

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.190
prisoner A is true and doesn't
say anything, then prisoner A

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.080
is going to get stuck with five
years and prisoner B is

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.140
going to get nothing.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.300
And if they both rat each
other out then they

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.550
both get two years.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.080
So people understand
the payoff.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.150
Are there questions about
the set-up here?

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.150
This is complicated so
got to make sure you

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.220
understand the set-up.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.390
Now, could someone tell me, if
A and B could truthfully

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.975
cooperate, what would be the
optimal cooperative strategy?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.203
Yeah.

00:13:16.203 --> 00:13:18.921
AUDIENCE: You both
go for a year.

00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:20.950
PROFESSOR: Right, you'd
both be silent.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.780
So the optimal cooperative
strategy is clear, which is to

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.370
both be silent.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.350
So if the cop said, you know
what, we'll let you guys get

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.510
together and discuss what
you want to do first--

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.450
which the cops would never be
stupid enough to do-- but if

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.170
they did and the guys can trust
each other, then that's

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.420
the optimal cooperative
strategy.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.150
What we call optimal in the
language of game theory, we

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.555
call that the dominant
strategy.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.720
A dominant strategy is the best
thing to do no matter

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.780
what the other guy does is
the dominant strategy.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.150
So the dominant cooperative
equilibrium strategy is to

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.570
both stay quiet.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.950
But what's the dominant,
non-cooperative strategy?

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.045
What is the dominant
non-cooperative strategy?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.960
So the ways with dominant
strategy, we run through.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.830
Take prisoner A, ask
the following.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.830
The dominant strategy is, is
there a strategy that makes

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.300
him better off regardless
of what B does.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.410
Is there a strategy that makes
A better off regardless of

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.020
what B does.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.790
Let's go through.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:42.760
If A remains silent, if B
remains silent he gets a year.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.180
If B talks he gets five years.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.780
Now compare that to prisoner
A strategy of talking.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.870
Well if he talks he's better off
than if he doesn't talk,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.470
if B's remaining silent.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.430
If he talks he's better
off than if he

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.980
doesn't talk if B talks.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.010
That is regardless of what B
does, he's better off talking.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.210
Regardless of what B chooses to
do, his dominant strategy

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.380
is to talk.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.740
Because if B is silent, he's
better off if he talks.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.310
If B talks he's better
off if he talks.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.670
So matter what B chooses to do,
A is better off talking.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.930
What about B?

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.680
Well B, by the same logic,
is always better

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.210
off talking as well.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.590
No matter what A chooses
to do, B is

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.060
better off if he talks.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.580
So where do we end up?

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.760
What ends up as the
Nash equilibrium?

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.750
The Nash equilibrium is that
both prisoners talk.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.040
The dominant strategy for both
prisoners is to talk.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.770
And they both end up worse off
than they could have if they

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.260
could have cooperated.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.710
So the dominant non-cooperative
strategy is to

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:01.930
both talk, even though if they
could get together they'd be

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.700
better both not talking.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.410
And this is basically how
game theory works.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.010
Game theory math gets
incredibly hard.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.370
And if you're interested,
14.12 is one of our most

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.690
popular undergraduate courses,
game theory.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.110
It's a great course where you
take this and go run with it

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.330
for a whole semester.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.360
It gets very complicated
mathematically.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.690
But the basic idea in game
theory is pretty

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.090
straightforward, which is just
ask, are there dominant

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.780
strategies that can be played
by each player.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.360
If each player has a dominant
strategy and those dominant

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.480
strategies lead to a Nash
equilibrium then you're done.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.125
Here we're in a Nash
equilibrium.

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:36.040
Why are we in a Nash
Equilibrium?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.730
Because given that A has talked,
B's strategy, which is

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.090
talking is the optimal
thing to do.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.590
Given that B has talked, A's
strategy which is talking is

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.850
the optimal thing to do.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.600
So given what the other person's
doing, each person is

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.650
doing the right thing.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.660
So you're in Nash equilibrium.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.570
Given that B has chosen
to talk, A is talking.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.560
That's the profit maximizing
thing to do.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.030
Given that A is talking,
B is talking.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.890
That's the profit maximizing
thing to do.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.629
So given the strategy the other
player's chosen that's

00:17:07.629 --> 00:17:08.380
an equilibrium.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.879
Yeah.

00:17:08.879 --> 00:17:12.871
AUDIENCE: If they both talk and
got 10 years would that be

00:17:12.871 --> 00:17:14.368
the Nash equilibrium.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:17.869
PROFESSOR: No if they both
talk, the 10 years only

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.339
happens if one talks and
the other one doesn't.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.331
AUDIENCE: No, I mean
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:23.849
PROFESSOR: Oh, if they
both got 10 years?

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:24.849
So let's ask that.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.099
Let's change this.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.470
Now let's just rework it.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.760
So now what's A's choice?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.920
Well A if he talks
and B's silent,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.560
then he's better talking.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.480
But if he talks and B talks,
he's worse talking.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.190
So then what he does depends
on what B does.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.340
What B does is going to
depend on what A does.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.870
And we can't obviously see the
Nash equilibrium here.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.610
Because there's no dominant
strategy.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.120
What you do depends on what
the other person does.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.350
So there's no dominant
strategy.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.350
Dominant strategies only occur
if there's something that you

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.720
should do no matter what
the other person does.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.800
So in this case were these are
both 2, there is a dominant

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.880
strategy, It's to talk.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.280
If those are both 10 there's no
longer a dominant strategy

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.360
so we can't quickly get
the Nash equilibrium.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.250
It's a good question.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.690
Now this is not just a cute
example that you can use for

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.590
prisoners, but actually
explains firm

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.270
behavior in many contexts.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.920
So the best example I like to
think of of this is to think

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.130
about advertising.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.950
So imagine if Coke and Pepsi,
and imagine a world where

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.360
Pepsi was as popular as Coke.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.090
That should never happen.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.960
Coke's way better.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.880
But imagine that
was that world.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.480
So imagine a world where if
there's no advertising then

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.760
basically Pepsi and Coke would
split the market 50-50.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.000
Imagine that set up.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.770
So if Pepsi and Coke could agree
not to advertise they'd

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.660
split the market 50-50.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.050
However, it's going to turn out
that while that may be the

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.280
dominant cooperative outcome,
that's not the dominant

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.310
non-cooperative outcome because
each firm is better

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.615
off advertising if the other
one doesn't, or regardless.

00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:07.820
So for example, imagine the
following payoffs matrix.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.330
I'm just making this up.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.800
But here you have Pepsi and
here you have Coke.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.780
And imagine the payoff matrix.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:26.650
And the payoff matrix is if they
don't advertise, so Pepsi

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.435
can choose not to advertise,
or it can advertise.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.910
So if they both don't advertise
Pepsi gets 8 and

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.510
Coke gets 8.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.110
I don't know what 8 is.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.230
8 is billion dollars.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.950
I'm just making up numbers
here, doesn't matter.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.450
So $8 billion each.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.840
If they both do advertise then
they still end up splitting

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.320
the market.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.880
Because basically they're just
as good as each other.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.510
So they both spend all the money
advertising and just

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.250
back up where they would have
started, except they've wasted

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.000
all this money in advertising.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.170
So if they both advertise they
each earn $3 billion instead

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.320
of $8 billion.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.410
That is, they each
split the market.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.540
They end up back where they
would have started but they

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.760
pissed away a bunch of money
advertising along the way.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.120
However if Coke advertised
and Pepsi doesn't.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.696
Then almost everybody sees Coke,
Coke, Coke everywhere

00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:17.440
and is like, Pepsi?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.320
Never heard of that.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.300
Coke makes $13 billion and
Pepsi loses $2 billion.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.250
And likewise if Coke doesn't
advertise but Pepsi does,

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.230
people are like, I've
never heard of Coke.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.270
I'm going to drink Pepsi.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.785
So Pepsi makes $13 billion and
Coke makes minus $2 billion.

00:20:33.785 --> 00:20:36.550
Once again I just made numbers
here so it would work, but

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.360
these aren't real
world examples.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.080
So once again we can see there
is a dominant cooperative

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.930
strategy, which is
they both should

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.150
agree let's not advertise.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.170
But if they can cooperate, then
in fact what's the Nash

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:53.700
equilibrium?

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.840
Let's work it through.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.730
And there's no shortcuts here.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:56.670
You've just got to work
this through.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.860
Let's look for Pepsi.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.450
Well Pepsi says if Coke doesn't
advertise I'm better

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.610
off advertising.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.860
If Coke does advertise, I'm
better off advertising.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.240
So my dominant strategy
is to advertise.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.980
Coke says, well gee, if Pepsi
doesn't advertise I'm better

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.530
off advertising.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.000
I make $13 billion instead
of $8 billion.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.840
If Pepsi does advertise I make
$3 billion instead of negative

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.000
$2 billion.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.440
So I'm better off
advertising too.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.060
So my dominant strategy
is to advertise.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.960
So for both firms the dominant
non-cooperative

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.220
strategy is to advertise.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.110
So they both advertise and you
end up in this equilibrium.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.380
It's an example of how a
non-cooperative equilibrium

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.680
can lead to what we call
a race to the bottom.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.520
You can think of it as
a race to the bottom.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.120
In other words, if they could
cooperate they could just be

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.550
better off.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.460
But because they can't trust the
other, there's this race

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.410
to the bottom where they
both end up worse off.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.730
This is pretty striking.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.670
I thought they brought this out
well in A Beautiful Mind,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.550
both the movie and the book,
which is that all we've

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.180
learned about economics
so far is that

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.520
competition is good, right?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.940
Competition is beneficial.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.190
Well here's a case, where in
fact, at least in the firm's

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.750
perspective, competition
is bad.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.670
If they could just get together
and cooperate they

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.570
could make more money.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.470
Now, in fact, this example
is not so far-fetched.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.810
I don't know when it
started but it

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:23.930
was during your lifetimes.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:30.460
When you were young, hard
liquors, scotch, bourbon,

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.290
whisky, et cetera, did not
advertise on television.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.090
You never saw a Johnny Walker
ad or anything on television

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.690
until, I don't know when
it changed maybe five

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.250
or six years ago.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.150
Maybe 10 years ago,
I don't know.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.860
But certainly in
your lifetimes.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.250
That was not by government
regulation.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.370
Many people thought there
was a government

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.210
regulation, they couldn't.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.060
That was not.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.470
That was a cooperative
equilibrium where the makers

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.500
of hard liquors got together and
agreed not to advertise on

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.800
TV. And they said it was in
the "public interest" yada

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.370
yada yada, but that wasn't.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.040
It was just they recognized the
benefits of cooperating

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.720
and not wasting money
advertising on TV and

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.020
competing with each other.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.990
Well that broke down some
number of years ago.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.706
And now you see whiskey ads
and scotch ads and other

00:23:09.706 --> 00:23:10.820
things on television.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.220
And they've moved to this
non-cooperative equilibrium

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.865
where they're all losing money
by having this advertising.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.410
So that's in advertising.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.660
For me, once again, this is a
hard thing, what intuition

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.540
works for you.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.320
For me the intuition works best
maybe from my scars from

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.890
my dating life is thinking
about personal decisions.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.970
So imagine that there's some
girl named Allison.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.600
And Allison has a potential
problem with her boyfriend.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.970
They've had a fight and now
she's deciding whether or not

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.010
to make up or break up.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.720
Now we can think of this just
like Coke and Pepsi.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.070
Allison is going to be thinking,
well gee, if he

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.790
wants to make up with me and I
want to make up with him then

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.230
we're both better off.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.470
But if I want to make up with
him and he doesn't want to

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.920
make up with me, that makes me
look like a total idiot.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.210
Whereas if I break up with him
preemptively, yes it would be

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.040
sad if he wanted to stay with
me, but at least if he wanted

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.150
to break up with me
I look better.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.880
So she preemptively breaks
up with him.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.550
John, her boyfriend, thinking
the same thing, behaves in

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.970
exactly the same way.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.940
So it could be that even though
they both would be

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.890
better off if they just said,
look the honest truth is,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.470
we're both wrong, let's make
up and we'll both be happy.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.590
Because they're so afraid of
being the one being dumped,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.740
they end up breaking up.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.560
Now we all know of examples
like this from life, where

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.720
people stupidly if they could
have just cooperated had a

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.830
better outcome because they're
so afraid of being left with

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.740
the short end of the stick,
because they don't cooperate

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.780
you end up with the worst
outcome for both.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.310
That's an example of
a non-cooperative

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.090
equilibrium in real life.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:53.610
Now in real life there is one
aspect of oligopolistic

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:58.240
non-cooperative equilibria
that allow them to be

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.000
enforced, however.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.790
That allow you to overcome
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.470
There's one thing that allows
you to overcome the prisoner's

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.225
dilemma and that's
repeated games.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.890
Repeated games can
help you overcome

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.140
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.420
Now let's take the Coke and
Pepsi example and let's

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.830
imagine that they're making
the advertising

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.840
decision every period.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.590
Every period they
have to make an

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.730
independent advertising decision.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.240
They can advertise or not
advertise every period.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.170
And imagine Coke says to Pepsi,
I've got the following

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.060
deal for you.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:47.210
I commit to not advertise as
long as you don't, but the

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.540
minute you advertise I'm going
to advertise forever.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.310
So as long as you don't
advertise I won't.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.900
But if you ever run an ad, the
bet's off and I'm never going

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.720
to cooperate with you.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.400
I'm going to advertise
forever.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.310
Let's think about Pepsi's choice
in period one if Coke

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.190
presents them with this deal.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.930
Let's think about Pepsi's choice
if Coke presents them

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.180
with this deal.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.450
Well one thing is they could
say, ha ha, great Coke, good

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.210
job trusting me.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.560
I'm going to screw you in
advertising period one.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.130
So Pepsi could say, great,
Coke's laid down arms in

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.170
period one.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.460
I'm going to go and advertise.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.250
I'll make $13 billion in period
one because Coke's

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.210
wimped out.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.160
And then I'll make $3 billion
forever after, because forever

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.400
after we're both going
to advertise.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.400
But at least I' beat them
up that first period.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.570
However, if Pepsi says, wait
a second, if Coke's really

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.930
right, honest, then I can get
an equilibrium where we make

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.780
$8 billion forever.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.790
And certainly $8 billion forever
a better deal than $13

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.330
billion one year and
$3 billion forever.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.560
So in fact if Coke's willing
to live up to that promise

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.000
then that is a good deal.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.360
And actually we can turn this
non-cooperative equilibrium

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.770
into a cooperative equilibrium
through the enforcement of a

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.570
repeated game.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.650
Through the fact that this game
gets played over and over

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:05.940
and over again you can enforce
a cooperative equilibrium.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.970
We can come back to
relationships again.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.910
If you're in a committed
relationship and you know that

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.020
if I say it's your fault over
and over again, eventually

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.230
person's going to leave. Then
people say gee, I'm willing to

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.460
take some of the blame and not
always say it's your fault and

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.620
we have a fight.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.230
Because I know that if I always
say it's your fault

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.740
ultimately that will break the
relationship up and that makes

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.180
me worse off then admitting it
was my fault some of the time.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.470
It's the same logic.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.860
Yeah.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.480
AUDIENCE: Is the point of the
game to make more than the

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.510
other guy or to make as
much as possible?

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.580
PROFESSOR: Make as
much as possible.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.530
That's a good point.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.570
I presume that the point is to
make as much as possible.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.850
I'm ruling out cut off your
nose to spite your face

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.920
equilibria.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.230
So in other words, I'm assuming
the goals is to

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.050
maximize profits not relevant
mark position.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.830
That's a good point.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.920
I should have made that
assumption clear.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.000
It's the assumption we're always
making whatever we

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.270
confirm behavior is assuming
it's profit maximization.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:03.280
So repeated games can enforce
a cooperative equilibria,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.080
essentially.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.550
Even in a non-cooperative
set up.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.570
But it turns out this
only works if the

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.820
game goes on forever.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.440
This only works if the game
is going to go on forever.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.450
So, for example, imagine that
Pepsi knows that in 10 years

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.380
the US government is going to
ban the advertisement of

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.080
sugared sodas.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.640
The US government is going to
finally say, look, people are

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.040
too obese, no more advertising
sugary sodas.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.710
Pepsi knows this.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.590
In 10 years that's
going to happen.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.270
Well Pepsi's thinking,
gee, that means in

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.790
year 10 I should advertise.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.580
In that last year I should
advertise because Coke can't

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.160
punish me the next year because
no one can advertise

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.340
the next year.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.410
So I know starting after 10
years we're both in this

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.960
equilibrium because
the government's

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.900
going to enforce it.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.070
So in ninth year, right
beforehand, right before that

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.080
government ban I should
advertise and Coke can't get

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.480
me the next period because
they don't have the

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.140
tool to punish me.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.980
Well Coke, of course,
knows Pepsi is going

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.680
to behave that way.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.430
So Coke says, wait a second,
if Pepsi's going to behave

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.680
that way then I better advertise
in the ninth period

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.540
too or I'm going to get hit
with a minus $2 billion.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.480
So I'm going to advertise
in the ninth period too.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.305
Well Pepsi says, look, if Coke's
going to advertise in

00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:15.600
the ninth period for sure, I may
as well advertise in the

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.170
eight period because Coke's
going to advertise in the

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.980
ninth period for sure.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.910
And by the same logic you can
work it back that they'll both

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.220
advertise right away and
you'll end up with a

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.300
non-cooperative equilibrium.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.290
That is a repeated game that
does not enforce the

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.700
cooperative equilibrium.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.260
Because by working that logic
backwards if it ends in some

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.230
realistic time frame, then you
better off just breaking it

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.060
now rather waiting for
that period where

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.670
you're the one who loses.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.080
Yeah.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.030
what if Pepsi [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.290
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.400
If they don't then you could
imagine that if Pepsi knows

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.583
this and Coke doesn't, then
Pepsi's optimal strategy will

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.810
be to cooperate to the next to
last period then go ahead and

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.480
screw Coke and then
Coke will lose.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.020
But presuming symmetric
information, repeated games

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.890
cannot enforce these equilibria
if they end.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:10.930
So this is just an incredibly
quick introduction to the fun

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.530
that is game theory.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.510
We're going to go on now and do
more rigorous versions of

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.460
these models.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.125
But this is just to get you
excited about the tools you

00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:22.270
can do with game theory
with fun examples.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.880
Game theory is about taking
these fun examples and

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.190
thinking a lot harder
about a lot.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.320
What if there's asymmetric
information?

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.905
What if the game ends long
enough in the future that

00:30:31.905 --> 00:30:33.000
you're willing to be patient?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.270
How far off in the future does
the game have to end to still

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.700
enforce the cooperate
equilibrium?

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.270
What if there are
three players?

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.680
What if players move in
different orders?

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.440
What if one player goes first,
the second player responds to

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.670
that, is it different than if
they go simultaneously?

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.690
These are all really interesting
issues that are

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.060
very relevant to the real world
firm behavior that you

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.090
learn about game theory.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.890
So this is just to whet your
appetite for that.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.190
Having done that we're going to
now turn, leave aside these

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.430
more interesting dynamic issues
and focus on a specific

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:04.120
example of a non-cooperative
oligopoly.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.400
Because, once again, this is
all fun intuitively, but we

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.620
want you to be able to work
through a problem.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.902
And the way to work that through
is we're going to have

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.290
to move to a specific,
simplified example.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.280
And the example we're
going to focus on is

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.070
called the Cournot model.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:27.695
The Cournot model of
non-cooperative oligopoly.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.340
The way we're going to do this
here, is we're going to return

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.320
to the example we had with
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.350
But instead of just facing two
choices, talk or not talk,

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.770
we're going to talk about firms
facing a whole continuum

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:44.750
of choices.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:49.040
Firms choosing how much they
produce in a non-cooperative

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.550
equilibria situation.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.420
So, for example, let's
take the example

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.500
they use in the book.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.160
Let's imagine there's two
airlines that fly between New

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.590
York and Chicago, American
and United.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.230
And let's imagine for simplicity
those are the only

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.830
two airlines.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.680
Because of the hub and spoke
system we talked about last

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.270
time, let's say all the gates in
Chicago that are available

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.130
to come from New York are
taken by two airlines--

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.260
United and American.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.170
Those are your only two options

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.440
flying New York to Chicago.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.920
And the question we want to ask
is, get in that world, how

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.890
do United and American decide
how many flights to run and

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.690
what price to charge?

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.980
If they're monopolies
we'd know.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.195
If it was a perfect competition
we'd know, but how

00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:30.445
do they decide this
all oligopolistic.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.630
The way we figure this out is
by looking for the Nash

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.520
equilibrium in this case, which
we also call Cournot

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.240
equilibrium.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:53.770
Which is basically the quantity
is chosen by each

00:32:53.770 --> 00:33:02.490
firm such that holding
all other

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.740
firms' quantities constant.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.320
So each firm chooses quantity
such that holding all other

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.545
firm's quantities constant they
are maximizing profits.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.270
So I choose a quantity such
that holding all the other

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.470
firm's quantities constant
I'm choosing a

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.940
profit-maximizing quantity.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:42.360
And if each firm can choose a
quantity that makes the market

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.510
function where this is met,
then you're in Cournot

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.450
equilibrium.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.310
You're in Cournot equilibrium
when each firm has

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.780
decided, I'm happy.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.290
It's the same as the
Nash concept.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.480
I'm happy with what I'm
producing given what everybody

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.410
else is producing.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.030
If everybody feels that way
then you're in a Nash

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.220
equilibrium or a Cournot
equilibrium.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.460
So to see this, this is not
immediately intuitive.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.900
Let me just talk you through
the steps of how

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.860
you'd solve for this.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.789
How do you actually solve for
a Cournot equilibrium?

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.560
So basically what are the
steps to solving?

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.400
Step one for solving a Cournot
equilibrium is to create each

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.900
firm's residual demand.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.800
So compute residual demand.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.909
We talked about residual
demand curves earlier.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.940
Which is, that's the demand for
my firm given the quantity

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.300
absorbed by other firms
in the market.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.159
In this case it's quantities
absorbed by the one other firm

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.699
in the market, but in
general you do this

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.050
with multiple players.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.689
So first you calculate
residual demand.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:58.660
Then having computed your
residual demand you develop a

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.660
marginal revenue function.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.710
You calculate your marginal
revenue which will be a

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.020
function of other firm's
quantities.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.740
So your residual demand will
lead you to calculate a

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.750
marginal revenue function.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.370
It's a function of other
firms' quantities.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:29.860
You then do the same, do one and
two for all firms. So for

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.960
each firm you end up with a
marginal revenue function and

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.330
a function of all the
firm's quantities.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.230
Step four is you have
n equations and n

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.615
unknowns and you solve.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.520
So you develop a series of
equation where each firm's

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.290
marginal revenue function is a
function of each other firms

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.540
quantities.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.230
You get one equation like
that for each firm.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.640
That leaves you n equations
and n unknowns you solve.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.370
If you can solve it then
you reach equilibrium.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.710
If you don't have a solution
then there is no stable Nash

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.210
equilibrium.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.400
But if you can solve that there
is a Cournot equilibrium

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.400
and you solve for it.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.780
So what we're going to do here
is I'm going to illustrate

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.420
this to you graphically today
and we'll work through some

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.250
more of the math of
it next time.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.780
So we'll start by doing
this graphically.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:27.410
So let's start by considering
the case of American Airlines.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.660
Let's start with figure 16-1.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.485
Start by considering the case
of American Airlines.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:43.440
And let's say that the demand
curve in this market in our

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.590
example we're going to do,
let's say that the demand

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:54.320
curve is of the form p
equals 339 minus q.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.570
So there's 339,000 flights that
are demanded each month.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:03.140
Each month there are 339,000
flights demanded

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.920
in the whole market.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.660
So 339,000 people want to
go from New York to

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.890
Chicago every month.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:16.080
And let's also assume the
marginal cost is $147.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.790
I don't know where Perloff came
up with these numbers,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.460
but let's just go with them.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.740
The specific numbers
don't matter.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.470
Now what would American Airlines
do if it was a

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.180
monopolist?

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.540
If American Airlines was a
monopolist, it would set

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:38.470
marginal revenues which are 339
minus 2q by the same math

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.040
we did before.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.670
You just multiply it through
by q and then differentiate

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.020
and you get 339 minus 2q
equal to the marginal

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.850
cost which is 147.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:38:00.180
So if it was a monopolist it
would choose a quantity of 96

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:07.644
and it would choose
a price of $243.

00:38:07.644 --> 00:38:10.020
A prices of $243 which
we would just get

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.150
out the demand curve.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.780
If the quantity is 96,
the price is $243.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.830
And that's what we see here.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.820
The marginal revenue curve
intersects the marginal cost

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.270
curve at a quantity of 96,000.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.540
You then go up to the demand
curve to read off the price.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.940
Remember for a monopolist you've
got to still respect

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.350
the demand curve.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.585
You get the demand curve
to read off the

00:38:32.585 --> 00:38:34.210
price, that's $243.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.560
That's what American would do if
they were monopolist. So if

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.350
they were the only folks flying
New York to Chicago,

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:47.480
they fly 96,000 people a month
at a price of $243,000.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.360
However, now let's say American
recognizes that

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.970
United is in the market.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.910
And let's say American
recognizes that United is

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.490
going to deliver some amount
of flights q sub u.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.675
They know American is going
to do some amount of

00:39:02.675 --> 00:39:03.510
flights q sub u.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.150
They don't quite know yet what
it is, but they know there's

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.400
going to be some amount
of flights q sub u.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.640
So the residual demand for
American is q sub a equals

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.130
total demand minus q sub u.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.480
That's their residual demand.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.370
So, for example, let's say that
American just guesses

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:31.140
that United will fly
64,000 passengers.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.050
Let's say Americans says, look,
I just know, I've got

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:39.230
some corporate spy who's told me
that United will fly 64,000

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.830
passengers.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.370
So what you want to do is then
you just re-solve the problem

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.300
but using residual demand.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.490
So then you say, well if United
is going to fly 64,000

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:53.810
passengers then my residual
demand is that price equals

00:39:53.810 --> 00:40:03.000
339 minus the quantity I sell,
q sub a, minus q sub u, which

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.400
I think is 64,000,
which is 64.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:17.600
So my new residual demand is
p equals 275 minus q sub a.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.720
That's my new residual demand.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.110
Because I thought United is
going to sell 64,000.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.520
So instead of my demand
being 339 minus q, now

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.520
275 minus q sub a.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.970
That's what's left.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:34.270
So if I use this as my new
demand function and re-solve,

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.700
if this is my demand function,
my marginal revenues are then

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:42.150
275 minus 2 qa.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.010
My marginal cost is the
same which is 147.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:52.530
So instead of my equation being
339 minus 2q equals 147.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:57.180
Now it's 275 minus
2qa equals 147.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:06.790
If I do that I'm going to get
a qa star of 64,000 flights.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.150
I'm going to say, well look, if
I was a monopolist I would

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.140
have deliver 96,000 flights.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.560
But given that United is
delivering 64,000, that's it's

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.030
going to be optimal for me
to also deliver 64,000.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.235
At 64,000 flights what's
my price going to be?

00:41:23.235 --> 00:41:25.730
Well my price is 275 minus qa.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:31.530
So my price is going
be to be $211.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.285
If I think United is delivering
64,000 flights then

00:41:34.285 --> 00:41:41.040
I'm going to deliver 64,000
flights at a price of $211.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.110
So that's basically how American
would function.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.440
Now what's strange about this
is American doesn't know how

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.090
many flights United is
going to deliver.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:50.890
There isn't such a thing.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:53.910
In fact, it's not like there's
not some rule which says we're

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.390
going to go 64,000.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.530
United is trying to figure
this out too.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.730
So, in fact, simultaneously to
American making this decision,

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.210
United is making the
same decision.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.180
And they're going through
the exact same math.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.140
They're saying, well gee, given
how much American flies,

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.390
how much should we fly?

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.620
They're going through
the same math.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:23.500
And in fact if we assume that
both firms have to face the

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.600
same marginal cost and the same
demand curve, then in

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.970
fact they're solving a
symmetric problem.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.380
They are also creating a
residual demand function, but

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.310
instead of being qa equals d
minus qu, now United is making

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.850
qu equals d minus qa.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.580
They're making a parallel
residual demand function and

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.110
they are solving as well.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.600
And both firms, therefore, are
ending up with choices of

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.310
quantities that depend on the
other firm's quantity.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:43:00.300
And in particular what they're
developing is what we call a

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.830
best response curve.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.980
So figure 16-2, I skipped
over figure 16-2.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:10.520
This just illustrates what
happens when American thinks

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.560
United is committing 64,000.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.060
Let's go through that
in one second.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.720
Get through it mathematically.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.630
This is an example where
American knows United is doing

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.390
64,000 flights.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.860
So they say, well look, my
residual demand is essentially

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.500
this new line d super r.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.420
And that's what I choose
on that new line.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.560
So that creates a new marginal
revenue curve, mr super r.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.290
That new marginal revenue curve
intersects marginal cost

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:38.250
at 64,000 and that's why I
fly only 64,000 flights

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.380
at a price of $211.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.395
So you see here is one example
of how given an amount United

00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:48.760
is flying, how American chooses
how much to fly.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.140
Questions about that graphic
that ties the math I did here?

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.410
What figure 16-3 does is say,
look, we can actually do this

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.240
for a whole host of possible
production levels

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.770
by the other firm.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.880
And we can develop what we call
best response curves.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.160
Best response curves are, given
what the other firm

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.290
does, what should I do.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:17.140
So, for example, American's best
response curve is given

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:22.190
that-- so on the x-axis we have
how many thousands of

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:27.180
flights American's passengers
are flying per quarter.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.290
On the y-axis how many thousands
of flights United

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:33.560
passengers are flying
per quarter.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:44.770
So, for example, if American
decides to fly zero flights

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.410
then United should fly
96 flights, right?

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.280
Then United is a monopolist.
So that's the point on the

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.150
y-axis, to 96,0 point
on the curve.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.600
With a 0 on the x-axis,
96 on the y-axis.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.350
If American decides to fly 0.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.580
United should fly 96.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.070
That's the monopoly case
we just solved.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:09.040
If American decides to fly
64, United should fly 64.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.710
That's the case we just
solved as well.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.355
Likewise, American's best
response curve is

00:45:14.355 --> 00:45:15.540
this steeper line.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.730
But it's the same thing.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.790
If United flies 0, American
should fly 96 then at 0 on the

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:23.110
y-axis, 96 on the x-axis.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:28.040
So if United flies 0 American
should fly 96.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.770
If United flies 64, American
should fly 64.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.680
So you can actually, literally
trace out these curves asking

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.770
at every single point, given
what the other guy's doing,

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.020
what should I do.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.410
So we solved for two points
on this curve.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.570
We solved for the other guy
producing zero point, which is

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.250
you produce 96.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.470
We solved for the other guy
producing 64 point which is

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:51.820
you produce 64.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.540
That same math can be used
to solve for every

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.300
point on this curve.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.780
Yeah?

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:57.235
192 point.

00:45:57.235 --> 00:46:00.330
PROFESSOR: The 192
point is it's the

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.630
question is the following.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:08.560
At what point would American
produce zero.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.855
How much when United have to
produce for American to

00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:11.540
produce zero.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.630
Well they'd only produce
zero if United

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.300
was producing 192,000.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.980
Only at that point would they
actually say, forget it, we're

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.730
just going to produce zero.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.000
That's what the 192
point means.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.780
Only if they knew United was
producing all that much would

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.150
they just drop out
of the market.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:33.440
So that's the 192
intersection.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.890
A backwards way to
read the curves.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.480
But the bottom line, is
essentially we can write these

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.760
best response curves.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.520
They're basically the quantity
I'm going to produce given the

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.980
quantity the other
firm produces.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.430
And the key thing is
that these are

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.030
symmetric in this example.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.180
Since the costs are the same
and they both face the same

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.540
market demand then these
curves are symmetric.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:12.680
What that means is that these
curves are having figured out

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.020
one you can automatically
draw the other.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.500
A trick for solving these
problems is that if you have a

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.490
symmetric Cournot equilibrium
you don't need to calculate

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.560
the math to find each firm's
best response curve.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.080
Once you calculate one you know
the other firm's just a

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.570
complement of it.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.030
So having calculated American's
best response curve

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.590
we could have automatically
drawn the United best response

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:36.010
curve as a complement of that.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.500
The other key point is by
drawing this diagram we can

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.820
see the Cournot equilibrium.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.690
Remember Cournot equilibrium.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.930
Cournot equilibrium is where
I'm happy with my quantity

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.840
given what the other
firm's doing.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.940
Given what the other firm's
doing I can't

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.280
make any more money.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.665
Once again, I don't care about
market share, I just care

00:47:53.665 --> 00:47:54.860
about money.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.480
So given what the other
firm's doing I can't

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480
make any more money.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.650
Well that happens
at 64,000 each.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.920
Because when American is
producing 64,000, United is

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.540
happy to produce 64,000.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.590
That's their profit
maximizing choice.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.530
If United is producing
64,000 American's

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.860
happy to produce 64,000.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.110
That's their profit
maximizing choice.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.500
So that point of each producing
64,000 we are in a

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.630
Nash or Cournot equilibrium.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:23.780
Both firms are happy given what
the other firm is doing.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.290
Both firms are profit maximizing
given what the

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.540
other firm is doing.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:33.630
Now basically, for example,
another way to look at this is

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.310
that you're only in equilibrium
if you're on both

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.390
firms' reaction curves.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.860
So, for example, American
might say, look the

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.060
equilibrium I like is
where I do 96,000

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.710
flights and you none.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:54.980
So the equilibrium I like is on
the x-axis the point 96, 0,

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.160
where I do 96,000 flights
and you United do none.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.070
United says, however, no that's
not optimal for me.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.480
Because if you're doing
that, then you're

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.000
charging a price of $243.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.170
So there's money to
be made for me.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.570
I can come in and start stealing
some of your flights.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:12.560
So that's not an equilibrium
from my perspective.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.790
Might be an equilibrium
from your perspective.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.820
You're delighted you're a
monopolist. But not from my

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.630
perspective.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:17.940
At that price I'll
come in and start

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.850
stealing some your business.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.670
And I'm going to start stealing

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.190
some of your business.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.500
As I steal your business you are
going to have to move up

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.670
your best response curve because
your residual demand

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.890
is shrinking.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.950
And you'll only reach
equilibrium when you're both

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.830
happy with the outcome.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.695
If only one firm is happy with
the outcome the other firm can

00:49:35.695 --> 00:49:38.200
always change its behavior,
raise its price up or down or

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.700
its quantity up or down to
change the market share and

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.820
change the outcome.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.330
So equilibrium will only be when
you're at both firms best

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.340
response curves.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.980
You'll only be at both firm's
best response curves where

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.270
they intersect.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:51.290
Let's stop there I'm going
to come back next time.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.070
Jessica we should have the
same handout next time.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.690
Let's make sure this figure
is in the handout

00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.670
next time as well.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.670
And we'll come back and talk
about this last figure and

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.010
we'll do the math behind
it as well.

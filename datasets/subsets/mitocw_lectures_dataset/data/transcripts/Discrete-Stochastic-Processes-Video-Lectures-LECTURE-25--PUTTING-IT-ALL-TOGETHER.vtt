00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.780
PROFESSOR: I guess
we should start.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.050
This is the last of
these lectures.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.940
The final will be on next
Wednesday, as I hope you all

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.700
know by this time, in the ice
rink, whatever that means.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.520
And there was some question
about how many sheets of paper

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.170
you could bring in
as crib sheets.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.780
And it seems like the reasonable
thing is four

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.960
sheets, which means you can
bring in the two sheets you

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.100
made up for the quiz
plus two more.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.280
Or you can make up four new
ones if you want or do

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.950
whatever you want.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.980
I don't think it's very
important how many sheets you

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.800
bring in, because I've never
seen anybody referring to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.880
their sheets.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.770
I mean, it's a good way of
organizing what you know to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.960
try to put it on four
sheets of paper.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.210
I want to mostly review what
we've done throughout the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.990
term, with a few more general
comments thrown in.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.740
I thought I'd start with
martingales, because we then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.410
completely finish what
we wanted to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.720
talk about last time.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.510
And the Strong Law of
Large Numbers was

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.800
left slightly hanging.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.790
And I want to show you
how to do that in a

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.870
little better way.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.070
And also show you that it's a
more general theorem than it

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.550
appears to be at first sight.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.686
So let's go with martingales.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:03.690
The basic definition is a
sequence of random variables

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.430
is a martingale, if, for all
elements of the sequence, the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.940
expected value of Zn, given all
of the previous values, is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.260
equal to the random variable,
Z n minus 1.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.230
Remember, and we've talked about
this a number of times,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.540
when you're talking about the
expected value of one random

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.010
variable, given a bunch of other
random variables, you're

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.050
only taking the expectation
over the first part.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.760
You're only taking the
expectation over Z sub n.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.940
And the other quantities are
still random variables.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.860
Namely, you have an expected
value Z sub n, for each sample

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.360
value of Z n minus 1, all
the way down to Z 1.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.520
And what the definition says is
it's a martingale only if,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.880
for all sample values of those
earlier values, the expected

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.190
value is equal to the sample
value of the most recent one.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.690
Namely, the memory is all
contained right in this last

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.390
term, effectively.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.920
At least as far as expectation
is concerned.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.626
Memory might be far broader than
that for everything else.

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:25.290
And the first thing we did with
martingales is we said

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.030
the expected value was again,
if you're only given part of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.770
the history, if you're only
given the history from i back

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.360
to 1, where i is strictly less
than n minus 1, that expected

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.170
value is equal to Zi.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.920
So no matter where you start
going back, the expected value

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.160
of Z sub n is the most recent
value that is given.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.960
So if the most recent value
given is Z 1, then the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.590
expected value of Zn,
given Z1, is Z1.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.400
And also along with that, you
have the relationship, the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.700
expected value of Zn is equal
to the expected value of Zi,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700
just by taking the expected
value over Z sub i.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.950
So all of that's sort
of straightforward.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.570
We talked a good deal about
the increments of a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.970
martingale.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.050
The increments, X sub n equals
Z sub n minus Zn minus 1, are

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.890
very much like the increments
that we have when a renewal

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.900
process, when a Poisson
process, all of these

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.530
processes we talked about we
can define in various ways.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.410
And here we can define a
martingale in two ways also.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.950
One is by the actual martingale
itself, which are,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.570
in a sense, the sums
of the increments.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.070
And the other ways in terms
of the increments.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.680
And the increments satisfy the
property that the expected

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.850
value of Xn, given all the
earlier values, is equal to 0.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.430
Namely, no matter what are all
the earlier values are, X sub

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.010
n has mean 0 in order
to be a martingale.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.940
A good special case of this is
where X sub n is equal to U

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:25.430
sub n times Y sub n, where the
U sub n are IID, equiprobable

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.330
1 and minus 1.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.870
And the Y sub i's are anything
you want them to be.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.490
It's just that the U sub i's
have to be independent

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.110
of the Y sub i.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.420
So I think this shows that in
fact martingales are really a

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.470
pretty broad class of things.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.050
And they were invented to talk
about fair gambling games,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.540
where they wanted to give the
gambler the opportunity to do

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.420
whatever he wanted to do.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.770
But the game itself was defined
in such a way that, no

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.340
matter what you do,
the game is fair.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.910
You establish bets in one
whatever things you want to.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.260
And when you wind up with it,
the expected value of X sub n,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.430
given the past, is always 0.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.640
And that's equivalent to saying
the expected value of Z

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.900
sub n, given the past,
is equal to Z sub i.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.890
Examples we talked about are 0
mean random walks and products

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.000
of unit-mean IID random
variables.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.830
So they're both these product
martingales, and there are

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.710
these sum martingales.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.000
And those are just two simple
examples, which

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.670
come up all the time.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.035
Then we talked about
submartingales.

00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:43.590
A submartingale is like
a martingale, except

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.290
it grows with time.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.560
And we're not going to talk
about supermartingales,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.750
because a supermartingale is
just a negative submartingale.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.960
So we don't have to
talk about that.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.570
A martingale is a
submartingale.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.150
So anything you know about
submartingales applies to

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.970
martingales also.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.110
So you can state theorems for
submartingales and they apply

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.160
to martingales just as well.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.370
You can say stronger things very
often about martingales.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.270
And then we have the same
theorem for submartingales.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.450
Now that should say, and it did
say, until my evil twin

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.830
got a hold of it, if Zn is a
submartingales, then for n

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.250
greater than i, greater than
0, this expected value is

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.740
greater than or equal to Zi.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.480
And the expected value Zn is
greater than equal to the

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.070
expected value of Zi.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.920
In other words, this theorem,
for submartingales, is the

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.470
same as the corresponding
theorem for martingales,

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.770
except now you have inequalities
there, just like

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.100
you have inequalities in
the definition of the

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.970
submartingales.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.530
So there's nothing
strange there.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.560
Then we found out that, if you
have a convex function, from

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.320
the reals into the reals, then
Jensen's inequality says that

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.750
the expected value of h of X is
greater than or equal to h

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.300
of the expected value of x.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.170
We showed a picture for
that you remember.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.800
There's a convex curve.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.520
There's some straight line.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.930
And what Jensen's inequality
says is you take an average

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.919
over the expected value
of X, and you're

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.620
somewhere above the line.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.070
And you take the average
first, and you're

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.320
sitting on the line.

00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:45.620
So if h of X is convex, that's
what Jensen's inequality is.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.460
And it follows from that that,
if Zn is a submartingale--

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.480
and that includes
martingales--

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.460
and h is convex and the expected
value of h of X is

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.420
finite, then h of Zn is
a martingale also.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.300
In other words, if you have
a martingale Z sub n, the

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.535
expected value of Z sub
n is a submartingale.

00:09:11.535 --> 00:09:16.490
The expected value of E to
R Zn is a martingale.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.790
Use whatever convex function you
want to, and you wind up,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.230
martingales go into
submartingales.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:30.400
You can't get out of the range
of submartingales that easily.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.000
We then talked about stopped
martingales and stopped

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.805
submartingales.

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:41.020
We said a stopped process,
for a possibly

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.330
defective stopping time--

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.150
now you remember what
a stopping time is?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.400
A stopping time is a random
variable, which is a function

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.590
of everything that takes place
up until the time of stopping.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.530
And you have to look at the
definition carefully, because

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.030
stopping time comes in too many
places to just say it and

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.770
understand what it means.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.130
But it's clear what it means,
if you view yourself as an

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.000
observer watching a sequence of
random variables, of sample

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.940
values of random variables,
one after another.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.160
And after you see a certain
number of random variables,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.200
your rule says, stop.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.940
And then you don't
observe anymore.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.690
So you just observe this
finite number.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.135
And then you stop
at that point.

00:10:28.135 --> 00:10:29.860
And then you're all done.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.170
If it's a possibly defective
stopping rule, then you might

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.250
keep on going forever,
or you might stop.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.580
You don't know what you're
going to do.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.100
The stopped process Z sub n
star is a little different

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.400
from what we were
doing before.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.610
Before what we were doing
is we were sitting there

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.730
observing this process.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.390
At a certain point, the stopping
rule said stop.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.900
And before, we were
very obedient.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.550
And when the stopping rule told
us to stop, we stopped.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.900
Now, since we know a little
more, we question authority a

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.960
little more.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.470
And when the stopping rule says
stop, we break things

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.180
into two processes.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.980
There's the original process,
which keeps on going.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.360
And there this stopped process,
which just stops.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.730
And it's convenient to have a
stopped process instead of

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.300
just a stopping rule.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.000
Because with a stopped process,
you can look at any

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.670
time into the future, and if
it's already stopped, you know

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.050
what the stopped value is.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.270
You know what it was
when it stopped.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.100
You don't necessarily know when
it stopped, by looking at

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.710
in the future.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.370
But you know that it did stop.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:51.448
So the stopped process, well,
it says here what it is.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.740
It satisfies the stopped value
at time n as equal to Z sub n,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.110
if n is less than or equal to
the stopping time J, and Z sub

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.430
n star is equal to Z sub J,
if n is greater than J.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.740
So you get up to the stopping
timing, and you stop.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.880
And then it just stays
fixed forever after.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:22.170
And the nice theorem there is
that the stopped process for a

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:27.570
submartingale, with a possibly
defective stopping rule, is a

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.690
submartingale again.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.970
What that means is it's just a
concise way of writing, the

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.810
stopped process for a martingale
is a martingale in

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.140
its own right.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.140
And the stopped process for
a submartingale is a

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.350
submartingale in
its own right.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.680
So the convenient thing is, you
can take a martingale, you

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.870
can stop it, you still
have a martingale.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.200
And everything you know about
martingales applies to this

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.170
stopping process.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.180
So we're getting to the point
where, starting out with a

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.890
martingale, we can do lots
of things with it.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.650
And that's the whole
mathematical game.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.040
With a mathematical
game, you build up

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.740
theorems from nothing.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.690
As an experimentalist or an
engineer, you sort of try to

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:26.050
figure out those things from
the reality around you.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.700
Here, we're just
building it up.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:36.420
And the other part of that
theorem says that the expected

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.370
value of Z1 is less than or
equal to the expected value of

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.520
Zn star, is less than or equal
to the expected value of Zn

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.070
for a submartingale.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.570
And they're all equal
to a martingale.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:55.130
In other words, the marginal
expectations for a martingale,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.130
they start out a Z1.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.870
They stay at Z1.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.370
And for the stopped process,
they stay at that same value.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.350
And that's not too surprising.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.840
Because if you have a
martingale, if you go until

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.400
you reach the stopping point,
from that stopping point on,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.260
the martingale has mean
0, from that point on.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.610
Not the martingale itself,
but the increments of the

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.340
martingale have mean 0,
from that point on.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.920
And the stopped process
has mean 0.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.720
In other words, the stopped
process, the increments are

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720
actually 0.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.680
Whereas for the original
process, the

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.560
increments wobble around.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.390
But they still have mean 0.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:46.430
So this is a very nice and
useful thing to know.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.090
If you look at this product
martingale, Z sub n is E to

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.760
the rsn minus n gamma or r .

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.050
Why is that a martingale?

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.920
How do you know it's
a martingale?

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.880
Well, you look at the expected
value of this.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.070
And it's expected
value of this.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.910
The expected value of E to rsn
is the moment generating

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:21.610
function of Z sub
n, of s sub n.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.980
It's moment generating
function of E to rsn.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.355
And the moment generating
function of E to rsn is just E

00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:33.110
to the n gamma of r.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:40.560
So this is clearly something
which should be a martingale,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.090
because it just keeps at
that level all along.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.900
If you have a stopping rule,
such as a threshold crossing,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.200
then you've got a stopped
martingale.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.570
And subject to some little
mathematical nitpicks, which

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.440
the text talks about, this leads
you to the much more

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.370
general version of Wald's
identity, which says that the

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.790
expected value of Z, at the time
of stopping, is equal to

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.520
the expected value of
E to the rsJ minus J

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.300
gamma of r equals 1.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.310
This you remember is what Wald's
identity was when we

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.180
were just talking about
random walks.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.980
And this was a more general
version, because it's talking

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.910
about general stopping rules,
instead of just to thresholds.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.730
But it does have these little
mathematical nitpicks in it,

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.030
which I'm not going to
talk about here.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.020
Then we have Kolmogorov's
submartingale inequality.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.400
We talked about all of these
things last time.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.310
So we're going pretty quickly
through them.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.390
The submartingale inequality
is really the Markov

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.390
inequality souped up.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.280
And what it says is, if you
have a non-negative

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.100
submartingale, that can
include a non-negative

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.560
martingale, for any positive
integer m, the probability

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.940
that the maximum is a Z sub i,
from 1 to m, is greater than

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.109
or equal to a, is less than or
equal to the expected value of

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.150
Z sub m over a.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:25.150
You see all that the Markov
inequality says is the

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.990
probability that Z sub m is
greater than or equal to a, is

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.770
less than or equal to this.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.930
This puts a lot more teeth into
it, because it lets you

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.310
talk about all of these random
variables, up until time m.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.630
And it says the maximum
of them satisfies this

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.100
inequality.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.410
I mean, we always knew that
the Markov inequality was

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.570
very, very weak.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.820
And this is also pretty weak.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.580
But it's not quite as
weak, because it

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.940
covers a lot more things.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.930
If you have a non-negative
martingale--

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.520
this is submartingales,
this is martingales.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.270
You see here, with
submartingales, the expected

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.640
value of Z sub m keeps
increasing with m.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.450
So there's a trade-off between
making m large and

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.700
not making m large.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.020
If you're dealing with a
martingale, then expected

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.010
value Z sub m is constant
over all time.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.680
It doesn't change.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.550
And therefore, you can take
this inequality here.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.570
You can go to the limit,
as m goes to infinity.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.920
And you wind up with a
probability, the sup of Zm,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.390
greater than or equal to a, is
less than or equal to the

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.510
expected value of the first of
those random variables, the

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.390
expected value of
Z1 divided by a.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.440
So this looks like a very
powerful inequality.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.585
It turns out that I don't know
many applications of that.

00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:54.070
And I don't know why.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.780
It seems like it ought
to be very useful.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.930
But I know one reason, which is
what I'm going to show you

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.260
next, which is how you can
really use the submartingale

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.520
inequality to make it do an
awful lot of things that you

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.405
wouldn't imagine that it
could do otherwise.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.270
First, you go to the Kolmogorov
version of the

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.470
Chebyshev inequality.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.860
This has the same relationship
to the Kolmogorov

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:28.120
submartingale inequality as
Chebyshev has to Markov.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.170
Namely, what you do is, instead
of looking at the

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.020
random variables Z sub n, you
look at the random variable Z

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.630
sub n squared.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.230
And what do we know now?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:46.420
If Z sub n is a martingale or
a submartingale, Z sub n

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.880
squared is a martingale
or submartingale also.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.520
Namely, well, the only thing
we can be sure of is that Z

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.000
sub n squared is a
submartingale.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.260
But if it's a submartingale,
then we can apply this

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.990
inequality again.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.315
And what it tells us, in this
case, is the probability at

00:20:07.315 --> 00:20:11.840
the maximum of the magnitudes
of these random variables.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.370
Probably the maximum is greater
than or equal to b, is

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.870
less than or equal to the
expected value of Z sub m

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.600
squared over b squared.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.190
So before, just like the Markov
inequality, the Markov

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.530
inequality only works for
non-negative random variables.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.790
You go to the Chebyshev
inequality, because that works

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.500
for negative or positive
random variables.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.200
So that makes it kind of neat.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.120
And then what you have is this
thing, which goes down as 1

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.360
over b squared, which looks
a little stronger.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.690
But that's not the real reason
that you want to use it.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:21:02.480
Now, this inequality here only
works for the first m values

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.790
of this random variable.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.970
What we're usually interested
in here is what happens as m

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.630
gets very large.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:16.620
As m gets very large, this
thing, very often, blows up.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.410
So this [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.130
does not really do what
you would like an

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.980
inequality to do.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.960
So what we're going to do is,
first, we're going to say, if

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.950
you had this inequality here,
then you can lower bound this

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:41.940
by taking just a maximum, not
over 1 up to m, but only over

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.510
m over 2 up to m.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.640
Now why do we want to do that?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.250
Well, hold on and you'll see.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.390
But anyway this is bigger
than, greater than

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.580
or equal to, this.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.010
So what we're going to do now
is we're going to take this

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.640
inequality.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.930
We're going to use it for m
equals 2 to the m, for m

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.410
equals 2 to the k plus 1, m
equals 2 to the k plus 2, all

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.180
the way up to infinity.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:18.280
And so we're going to find the
probability of the union over

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.010
j greater than or equal to k of
this quantity here, but now

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:28.020
just maximized over 2 to the j
minus 1, less than n, less

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.180
than or equal 2 to the j.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.730
And then the maximum of Z sub
n, greater than or equal to.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.680
And now, for each one of these
j's here, we'll put in

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.460
whatever b sub j we want.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.680
So the general form of this
inequality then becomes.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.860
We have this term on the left.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.750
We use the union bound.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.690
And we get this term
on the right.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.470
So at this point, we have an
inequality, which works for

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.260
all n, instead of just
for values smaller

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.340
than some given amount.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.510
So this is sort of a general
technique for taking an

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:09.130
inequality, which only works
up to a certain value, and

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.300
extending it so it works
over all values.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.590
You have to be pretty careful
about how you choose b sub j.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.470
Now what we're going
to do is say, OK.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.870
And remember, what is happening
here is we started

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.370
out with a submartingale
or a martingale.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.920
When we take Z n squared, we
still have a submartingale.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.190
So we can use a submartingale
inequality, which is what

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.370
we're doing here.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.210
We're using the submartingale
inequality on Zm squared

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.910
rather than on Zm.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.120
And Zm squared is non-negative,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.060
so that works there.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.260
Then we go down to this point.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.750
We take a union over
all of these terms.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.650
And note what happens.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:03.430
Every n is included in one
of these terms, every n

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.080
beyond 2 the k.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.140
So if we want to prove something
about the limiting

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:16.860
values of Z sub n, we have
everything included there,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.160
everything beyond 2 to the k.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.690
But as far as the limit is
concerned, you don't care

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.340
about any initial finite set.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.950
You care what happens after
that initial finite set.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.940
So what we have then
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.130
of these terms, less than
or equal to this term.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:43.350
When I apply this to a random
walk S sub n, S sub n is a

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.650
submartingale, at this point.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.790
The expected value
of x squared will

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.470
assume a sigma squared.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:57.300
The expected value now S sub
n, or Z sub n is we'll call

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.070
it, is the sum of these n
IID random variables.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.376
So the expected value--

00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:04.910
AUDIENCE: 10 o'clock.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.430
PROFESSOR: The expected value
of Z to the 2J is just 2 to

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.090
the J times the expected value
of x squared, in other words,

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.120
sigma squared.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.370
[INAUDIBLE] just doing this
for a 0 mean [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.492
variable, because [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.492 --> 00:25:23.590
given an arbitrary
non-0 [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.590
random variable.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.540
You can look at it as to
mean plus a random

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.400
variable, which is 0 mean.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.390
So that's the same ideas
we're using here.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.770
So we take this inequality now,
and I'm going to use for

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:43.410
b sub J, 3/2 to the
J. Why 3/2 to J?

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.430
Well you'll see in
just a second.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.780
But when I use 3/2 to the J here
I get the maximum over S

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.830
sub n, greater than or equal
to 3/2 to the J.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:26:00.010
And over here I get b sub J
squared is 9/4 to the J. And

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:06.240
here I have 2 the J also.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.810
So when I sum this, it winds up
with 8/9 to the k times 9

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.620
sigma squared.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:18.040
So what I have now is something
where, when k gets

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.850
larger, this term
is going to 0.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.160
And I have something over here,
well that doesn't look

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.670
quite so attractive, but
just wait a minute.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.010
What I'm really interested
in is not S sub n.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.670
But I'm interested in
S sub n over n.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.710
For the strong law of large
numbers, I'd like to show that

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.300
S sub n over n approaches
a limit.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.690
And n in this case runs between
2 to the J minus 1 and

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.100
2 to the J.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.640
So when I put that in here--

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.640
we'll see what that amounts
to in the next slide.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.130
For the strong law of large
numbers, what our theorem says

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.290
is that the probability of the
set of sample points, for

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.890
which S sub n over n equals 0,
that set of sample points has

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.770
probability y.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.000
So the proof of that, if I pick
up this equation from the

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.590
previous slide, and when I lower
bound the left side of

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:30.030
this, what I'm going to get, I'm
going to divide by n here.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.500
And I'm going to divide by
something a little bit

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.060
smaller, which is 2 to
the J minus 1 here.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.730
So I get the maximum of S sub
n over n, greater than or

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.930
equal to 2 times 3/4 to the J.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.360
Now you see why I picked--

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.680
I think you see at this
point why I picked the

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.010
sub j the way I did.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.250
I wanted to pick it t to be
smaller than 2 to the J. And I

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:00.030
wanted to pick it to be big
enough that it drove the right

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.270
hand term to 0.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.230
So now we're done really.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.180
Because, if I look at this
expression here, a sample

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.290
sequence S sub n of omega,
that's not contained in this

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:21.810
union, has to approach 0.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:27.650
Because these terms from 2 to
the J minus 1 to 2 to the J,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.140
in order to be in this set, they
have to be greater than

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.180
or equal to 2 times
3/4 to the J.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.490
As j gets larger and larger,
this term goes to 0.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.930
So the only terms that exceed
that are terms that are

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.180
arbitrarily small.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.840
So the complement of this set is
the set of terms for which

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.350
S sub n over n does
not approach 0.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.270
But the probability of that is
8/9 to the k times time some

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.480
garbage over here.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.450
So now it's true for all k.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:20.130
The terms which approach 0,
namely the sampled values for

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.980
which S sub n over n approaches
0 are all

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.670
complimentary to this set.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:36.590
So the probability that S sub n
over omega over n approaches

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:43.460
0 is greater than 1 minus
this quantity here.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.990
That's true for all k.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.650
And since it's true for all
k, this term goes to 0.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.140
And the theorem is proven.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.280
Now why did I want to
go through this.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.080
There are perhaps easier ways
to prove the strong law of

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:08.990
large numbers, just assuming
that the variance is finite.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.502
Why this particular y?

00:30:11.502 --> 00:30:15.900
Well, if you look at this, it
applies to much more than just

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.100
sums of IID random variables.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.540
It applies to arbitrary
martingales, so long as these

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.800
conditions are satisfied.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.410
It applies to these cases, like
where you have a random

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:34.160
variable, which is plus or minus
1 times some arbitrary

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.680
random variable.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.050
So this gives you sort of a
general way of proving strong

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.390
laws of large numbers
for strange

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.110
sequences of random variables.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.610
So that's the reason for
going through this.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:54.050
We now have a way of proving
strong laws of large numbers

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.860
for lots of different kinds of
martingales, rather than just

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.690
for this set of things here.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:10.760
So let's move on back to Markov
chains, countable or

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.020
finite state.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.480
I'm moving back to chapter three
and five in the text,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.240
mostly chapter five, and trying
to finish some sort of

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.190
review of what we've done.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.280
When I look back at what we've
done, it seems like we've

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.990
proven an awful lot theorems.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.360
So all I can do is talk
about the theorems.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:38.490
I should say something, again,
this last day, on this last

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:44.310
lecture, about why we spend so
much time proving theorems.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.860
In other words, we've just
proven a theorem here.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:53.760
I promised you I would prove a
theorem every lecture, along

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.760
with talking about why they're
important and so on.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.760
And most of you are engineers
or you're scientists in

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.650
various fields.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.380
You're not mathematicians.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.120
Why should you be interested
in all these theorems.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.240
Why should you take abstract
courses, which

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.180
look like math courses?

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.210
And the reason is this kind of
stuff is more important for

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.800
you than it is for
mathematicians.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.410
And it's more important for
you, because when you're

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.190
dealing with a real engineering
or real scientific

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.410
problem, how do you
deal with it?

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.650
I mean, you have a real
mess facing you.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.550
You spend a lot of time trying
to understand what that mess

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.850
is all about.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.070
And you don't form a model of
it, and then apply theorems.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.690
What you do is to try
to understand it.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.590
You look at multiple models.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.780
When we were looking at
hypothesis testing, we said

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.450
we're going to assume a
priori probabilities.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.960
I lied about that
a little bit.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.050
We we're not assuming a
priori probabilities.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:10.340
We we're assuming a class of
probability models, each of

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.810
which had a priori probabilities
in them.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.560
And then we said something
about that class of

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.220
probability models.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.950
And saying something about
that class of probability

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.490
models, we were able to say a
great deal more than you can

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.960
say if you refuse to even think
about a model, which

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.980
doesn't have a priori
probabilities in it.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.960
So by looking at lots of
different models, you can

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.470
understand an enormous number
of things without really

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.940
having any one model which
describes the whole

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.650
situation for you.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.020
And that's why we try to prove
theorems for models, because

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.460
then, when you understand lots
of simple models, you have

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.280
these complicated physical
situations, and

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.570
you play with them.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.470
You play with them by applying
various simple models that you

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.170
understand to them.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.860
And as you do this, you
gradually understand the

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.060
physical process better.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.540
And that's the way we
discover things.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.260
OK, end of lecture.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:16.830
Not end of lecture, but end of
partial lecture about why you

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.080
want to learn some
mathematics.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:26.510
The first passage time from
state i to j, remember, is the

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:32.790
smallest n, when you start off
in state i, at which you get

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.610
to state j.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.690
You start off in state i.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.090
You jump from one lily
pad to another.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.040
You eventually wind up
at lily pad number j.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.989
And we want to know how long
it takes you to get to j.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:48.889
That's a random variable,
obviously.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:54.620
And this Tij, as possibly the
effective random variable,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.230
that has the probability
mass function.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.460
It's the definition of
what this probability

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.600
mass function is.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.480
And it has a distribution
function.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.490
And the probability
mass function--

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.900
you probably remember
how we derived this.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.200
We derived it by sort of
crawling up on it, by looking

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.900
at it, first, for n equals 1,
in which case it's just a

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.750
transition probability
of n equals 2.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.720
In which case, it's the
probability that you first go

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.760
to k, and then in n minus
1 steps, you go to j.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.710
But you have to leave j out,
because if you go to j in the

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:41.850
first step, you've already
had your first passage.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.870
so

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:49.120
We define a state to be
recurrent, if T sub jj is

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.980
non-defective.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.160
And we define it to be
transient otherwise.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.740
In other words, if it's not
certain that you ever get to

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.540
state j, then you define it
to be transient, if it's

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.400
recurrent and it's positive
recurrent, if the expected

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.740
value of T sub jj is
less than infinity.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.110
And it's null recurrent
otherwise.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.190
How do we know how
to analyze this?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.530
Well we study renewal
processes.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:21.300
And if you look at the renewal
process where you've got a

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.150
renewal every time you hit
state j, you start

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.040
out on stage j.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.710
The first time you hit state
j, that's a renewal.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.370
The next time you hit state
j, that's another renewal.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:40.150
You have a renewal process where
the interrenewal time is

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:47.920
a random variable, which has
the PMF F sub ij event.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:37:00.060
Excuse me, if you have a renewal
process, if you start

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:05.440
in state j, where T sub jj is
the amount of time before

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.730
renewal occurs, from that time
on, you get another renewal

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.790
with another random variable
with the same

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.990
distribution as Tjj.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:22.610
And F sub ij is the PMF
of that renewal time.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:29.620
And F sub ij is the distribution
function of it.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.460
So then when we define the state
j as being recurrent,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.030
what we're really doing is going
back to what we know

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:43.820
about renewal processes and
saying a Markov chain is

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:49.180
recurrent if the renewal process
that we define for

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:55.700
that countable state Markov
chain has these various

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.470
properties for this renewal
random variable.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.640
For each recurrent j, there's
an integer renewal counting

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.130
process N sub jj of t.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:14.180
You start in state j at time t,
which is after t steps of

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.230
the Markov process.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.850
What you're interested is how
many times have you hit state

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.570
j, up until time t.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:27.620
That's the counting process we
talk about in renewal theory.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:33.550
So N sub jj of t is the number
of visits to j starting in j.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.370
And it has the interrenewal
distribution F sub jj, which

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.520
is that quantity up there.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:45.250
We have a delayed renewal
counting process N sub ij of

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:51.030
t, if we count visits
to j, starting in i.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:55.100
We didn't talk much about
delayed renewal processes,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.220
except for pointing out that
when you have a delayed

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.930
renewal process, it
really is the same

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.410
as a renewal processes.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:05.160
It just has some arbitrary
amount of time that's required

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.790
to get to state j for the
first time and the keep

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.100
recurrent on.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.810
Even if the expected time to
get to j for first time is

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:17.370
infinite, and the expected time
for renewals from j to j

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.990
is finite, you still have this
same renewal processes.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.030
You can even lose an infinite
amount of time at the

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.480
beginning, and you amortize
it over time.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.100
Don't ask me why you can
amortize an infinite amount of

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.510
time over time.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.760
But you can.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:40.710
And actually if you read about
delayed renewal processes, you

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.601
see why you actually get that.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:51.740
So all states in a class are
positive recurrent, or all are

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.520
null recurrent, or all
are transient.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.620
We've proved that theorem.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.030
It wasn't really a very
hard theorem to prove.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:04.040
And you can sort of see
that it ought to be.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.860
Then we define the chain as
being irreducible, if all

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.340
state pairs communicate.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.050
In other words, if for every
pair of states, there's a path

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.800
that goes from one state
to the other state.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.790
This is intuitively a simple
idea, if you have a finite

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.480
state and Markov chain.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.390
If you have a countably infinite
state Markov chain,

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.420
it seems to be a little
more peculiar.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.080
But it really isn't.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.610
For a countably infinite state
an Markov chain every state

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.430
has a finite number.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.140
And you can take every
pair of states.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.750
You can identify them.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.260
And you can see whether there's
a path going from one

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:48.870
to the other.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:53.390
For all of these birth-death
processes we've talked about,

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.600
I mean, it's obvious whether
the states all

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.660
communicate or not.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.940
You just see if there's
any break in the

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.720
chain at any point.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.180
And it really looks
like a chain.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:07.850
It's a node, two transitions,
another node, two transitions,

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:09.570
another node.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.430
And that's just the way chains
are supposed to work.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:19.650
An irreducible class might
be positive recurrent.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.680
It might be null recurrent.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.880
Or it might be transient.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.600
And we already have seen what
makes a state null recurrent

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.280
or transient.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.720
And it's the same thing
for the class.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:47.830
We started out by saying
a state is either null

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:53.390
recurrent, positive recurrent,
or transient depending on this

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.070
renewal process associated
with it.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:00.210
And now there's this theorem,
which says that if one node in

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:06.880
a class of states is positive
recurrent, they all are.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.230
And you ought to be able
to sort of see

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.480
the reason for that.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:17.040
If I have one state which is
positive recurrent, it means

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.940
that the expected time to
go from this state to

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.210
this state is finite.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.060
Now if I had some other
state, I have to go

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.660
from here to there.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.230
I can go through here and
then off to there.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.490
So the amount of time it takes
to get to there, and then from

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.740
there to there, is also finite,
expected amount, and

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.060
the same backwards.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.030
So that was the way
we proved this.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.930
If we have an irreducible
Markov chain--

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.520
now this is the theorem you
really use all the time.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.580
This is sort of says how you
operate with these things.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.880
It says the steady
state equations--

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.530
they're the equations you've
used in half the problems

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.030
you've done with
Markov chains--

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:17.350
if these equations have a
solution for the pi sub j's,

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.250
remember the Markov chain is
defined in terms of the

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.050
transition probabilities
P sub ij.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.120
We solve these equations to find
out what the steady state

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.780
probabilities pi sub j are.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.900
And the theorem says, if you can
find the solution to those

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.230
equations--

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.830
pi sub j's have to
add up to 1--

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.720
then the solution is unique.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:50.640
The pi sub j's are equal to 1
over the mean time to go from

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.510
that state back to
that state again.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.960
And what does that mean?

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.760
What that really gives you is
not a way to find pi sub j.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.710
It gives you a way to
find a T sub jj.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:13.050
Because these equations are more
often the way that you

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.760
solve for the steady state
probabilities.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.010
And then that gives you a way
to find the mean recurrence

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.165
time between visits to
this given state.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.660
And what else does
this theorem say?

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.290
It says if the states are
positive recurrent, then the

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.450
steady state equations
have a solution.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:38.640
So this is an if and only
if kind of statement.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.570
It relates these equations,
these steady state equations,

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:48.820
to solutions and says, if
these equations have a

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.780
solution, then in fact
you have the

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.110
steady state equations.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.790
They satisfy all these
relationships about mean

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.310
recurrence time.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.910
And if the states are positive
recurrent, then those

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.790
equations have a solution.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:09.730
And in the solutions, the pi
sub j's are all possible.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.900
So it's an infinite set of
equations, so you can't

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.190
necessarily solve it.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.220
But you sort of know everything
there is to know

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.470
about it, at this point.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.730
Well, there's one other thing,
when you have a birth-death

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.670
chain, these equations simplify
a great deal.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:30.010
The counting processes under
positive recurrence have to

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.280
satisfy this equation.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.910
And my evil twin brother got a
hold of this and left out the

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.850
n in the copy that you have.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:46.060
And I spotted it when I looked
at it just a little bit.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.470
He was still sleeping, so
I've managed to find it.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.650
So it's corrected here.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.922
And what does that say?

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.380
It says, when you have positive
recurrence, if you

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.840
look from 0 out to t, and you
count the number of times that

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:10.600
you hit state j, that's
a random variable.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:16.980
If you take that and divide by
n, you look from time 0 out to

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:22.960
time N, N sub ij of N, it's
the number of times

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.660
you visit state j.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.850
You divide that by N, and
you go to the limit.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.130
And there's a strong law of
large numbers there, which was

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.650
a strong law of large numbers
for renewal processes, which

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.760
says that it has a limit
with probability 1.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.355
And this says that limit
is pi sub j.

00:46:43.355 --> 00:46:45.730
And that's sort of
obvious, again.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.340
I mean, visualize
what happens.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.900
You start out in state j.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.030
For one unit of time,
you're in state j.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.700
Then you go away from state j,
and for a long time you're out

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.220
in the wilderness.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.660
And then you finally get
back to state j again.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.770
Think of a renewal reward
process, where you get 1 unit

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:12.200
of reward every time you're in
state j and 0 reward every

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.360
time you're not in state j.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.470
That means every interrenewal
period, you pick

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.830
up one unit of reward.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.065
Well, this is what that says.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.190
It says that the fraction of
those visits to state j--

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.230
that out of the total visits in
the Markov chain, the ones

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.830
that go to state j have
probability pi sub j.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.020
So again this is another
relationship with these steady

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.200
state probabilities.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.860
The steady state probabilities
tell you what these mean

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.890
recurrence times are.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.300
And that tells you
what this is.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:08.060
This, in a sense, is
the same as this.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.290
Those are just sort of
the same results.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.540
So there's nothing
special about it.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.340
We talked a little bit about
the Markov model of age of

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.750
renewal process for any
integer valued renewal

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:33.010
process, you can find a Markov
chain which gives you the age

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.010
of that process.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.660
You visualize being
in state j.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:46.790
And you visualize being in state
0, of this Markov model,

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:50.550
at the point where you
have a renewal.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:56.670
One step later, if you have
another renewal, that happens

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:02.070
with probability P sub 00, you
go back to state 0 again.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.400
If you don't have a renewal
in the next time,

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.580
you go to state 1.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.830
From state 1, you might
go to state 2.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:13.200
When you're in state 2, it means
you're two time units

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.750
away from state 0.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:21.830
If you go back to state 0, it
means you have a renewal in

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.160
three time units.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.480
Otherwise you go to state 3.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.000
Then you might have a renewal
and so forth.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.360
So for this very simple kind
of Markov chain, this tells

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.920
you everything there is to
know, in the sense, about

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.540
integer value renewal
processes.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.820
So there's this nice connection
between the two.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.510
And it lets you see pretty
easily about when you have no

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:53.380
recurrence.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.280
Now we spend a lot of time
talking about these

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.800
birth-death Markov chains.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.400
And the easy way to solve for
birth-death Markov of chains

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:10.490
is to say intuitively that
between any two adjacent

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:14.370
states, the number of times
you go up has to equal the

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:16.980
number of times you go down,
plus or minus 1.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.000
If you start out here and you
end up here, you're going this

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.680
way one more time than you've
gone that way and vice versa.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:29.660
And combining that with the
steady state equations that we

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.600
now have been talking about,
it must be that the steady

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.900
state probability
of pi sub i--

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.000
pi sub i times P sub i is the
probability of going from

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.510
state 2 to state 3.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.850
It's the probability of being
in state 2 and making a

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:49.760
transition to state 3.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.820
This probability here is the
probability of being in state

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:59.580
3 and going to state 2.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.540
And we're saying that
asymptotically, as you look

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.330
over an infinite number of
transitions, those two have to

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.040
be the same.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.190
The other way to do it, if you
like algebra, is to start out

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.750
with a steady state equation.

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.750
And you can derive
this right away.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.710
I think it's nicer to
see intuitively

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.100
why it has be true.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:26.850
And what that says is if rho sub
i is equal to P sub i over

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:34.200
Q sub i plus 1, P sub i is the
up transition probability.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.920
Q sub i is the down transition
probability.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:45.330
Rho sub i is the ratio of the
two state probabilities.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:50.330
And that's equal to this
equation here.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.830
That's just how to calculate
these things.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.080
And you've done that.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.185
Let's go on to Markov
processes.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.990
I have no idea where I'm
going to finish up.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.310
I had a lot to do.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.100
I better not waste
too much time.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.470
Remember what a Markov
process is now.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:20.910
At least the way we started
out thinking about, it's a

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.080
Markov chain along with
a holding time.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.420
And each state is
a Markov chain.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:30.130
And the holding times are
exponential, to be a countable

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.450
state Markov process.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:36.300
So we can visualize it
as a sequence of

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.480
states, X0, X1, X2, X3.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.240
And a sequence of holding
times, U1, U2, U3, U4.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.760
these are all random
variables.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.110
And this kind of dependence
diagram says what random

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.790
variables depend on what
random variables.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:59.790
U1, given X0, is independent
of the rest of the world.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.960
U2, given X1, is independent
of the rest of the

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.930
world, and so forth.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:11.060
And if you look at this graph
here and you visualize the

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.740
fact that because of Bayes'
rule, you could go

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.490
both ways on this.

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:22.750
In other words, if this, given
this, is independent of

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:26.240
everything else, we
can go through the

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.760
same kind of argument.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:34.850
And we can make these arrows
go the opposite way.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.320
And we can say, if we just
consider these states here, we

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:46.480
can say that, given X3, U4 is
independent of X2 and also

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:52.130
independent of U3 and X1
and U2 and so forth.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:55.520
So if you look at the dependence
graph of a Markov

00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:01.230
chain, which is which states
depend on which other states,

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.870
those arrows there that we have,
which make it easier to

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.090
see what's going on, you
can take them off.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:10.210
You can redraw them in any way
you want to and look at the

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:15.080
dependencies in the
opposite way.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:25.610
Now to understand what the
state is at any time t,

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.650
there's an equation
to do that.

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.700
It's an equation that
isn't much help.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:37.600
I think it's more help to look
at this and to see from this

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.950
what's going on.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.785
You start in some
state that's 0.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:49.080
And starting in state 0, there's
a holding time in U0.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.680
The holding time is U1.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.870
And you stay in.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.230
And the time in U1 is an
exponential random variable

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.000
with rate U sub i.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.550
That's what this says.

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:06.300
So at the end of that holding
time, you go from state i to

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.590
some other state.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.040
This is the state you go to.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.950
The state you go to is according
to the mark Markov

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.710
chain probabilities.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.180
And it's state j in this case.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:22.230
You stay in state j until the
holding time U2, which is a

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:28.490
function of j, finishes you up
at this time and so forth.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:32.810
So if you want to look at what
state you're in at a given

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:37.060
time, namely pick a time here
and say what's the state at

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.760
this time, as a random
variable.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.460
So what you have to do then is
you have to climb your way up

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.970
from here to there.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:55.150
And you have to talk about the
value of S1, S2, and S3.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:58.180
And those are exponential
random variables.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:01.230
But they're exponential random
variables that depend on the

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:02.800
state that you're in.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.480
So as you're climbing your way
up and looking at this sample

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.070
function of the process, you
have to look at U1 an X0.

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:15.740
X0 defines what U1 is,
as a random variable.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.610
It says that U1 is an
exponential random variable,

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:21.190
with rate U sub i.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:25.050
So you get to here, then you
have some holding time here,

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:29.940
which is a function of j and
so forth, the whole way up.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:34.480
Which is why I said that an
equation for X of t, in terms

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.910
of these S's is not going to
help you a great deal.

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.340
Understanding how the process
is working I think

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.770
helps you a lot more.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.650
We said that there were three
ways to represent a Markov

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:55.350
process, which I'm giving
here in terms

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.630
just of Markov chains.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.410
The first one--

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:02.430
and the fact that these are all
for M/M/1 doesn't make any

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.050
difference.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:06.890
It's just these three
general [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.970
One of them is, you look at it
in terms of the embedded

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:13.220
Markov chain.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:26.990
For this embedded Markov
chain, the transition

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:31.290
probabilities, when you're in
state 0 in an M/M/1 queue,

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:33.470
what's the next state
you go to?

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:37.140
Well the only state you
can go to is state 1.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.110
Because we don't have any
self transitions.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.050
So you go up to state
1 eventually.

00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:45.930
From state 1, you can go that
way, with probability mu over

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.360
lambda plus mu.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.210
Or you can go this way, with
probability lambda over lambda

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:56.120
plus mu, and so forth
the whole way out.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:01.140
The next way of describing it,
which is almost the same, is

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:05.020
instead of using the transition
probabilities and

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.400
the embedded chain, you look
directly at the transition

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.500
rates for the Poisson process.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.580
Meaning the transition rates are
the new sub i's associated

00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:16.920
with the different states.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.540
When you get in state i, the
amount of time you spend is

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.810
state i is an exponential
random variable.

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.800
And when you make a transition,
you're either

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:32.020
going to go to one state or
another state, in this case.

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.380
In general, you might go to any
one of a number of states.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:47.650
Now if I tell that we start out
in state one and the next

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:53.430
state we go is state 2, now I
ask you what's the expected

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:56.140
amount of time that that
transition took?

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.390
What's the answer?

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:03.620
Is it queue 1, 2, or
is it mu sub 1?

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.804
Anybody awake out there?

00:59:13.804 --> 00:59:16.230
AUDIENCE: Sir, could you
repeat the question?

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:17.010
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:20.600
The question is, we started
out in state 1.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:25.730
Given that we started out in
state 1 and given that the

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:30.770
next state is state 2, what's
the amount of time that it

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.930
takes to go from 1 to 2?

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:34.850
It's an exponential
random variable.

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:37.722
What's the rate of that
random variable?

00:59:37.722 --> 00:59:39.210
AUDIENCE: Lambda plus U.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:39.706
PROFESSOR: What?

00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:41.330
AUDIENCE: Lambda plus U.

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.945
PROFESSOR: Lambda plus mu?

00:59:42.945 --> 00:59:44.610
Yes.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.990
Lambda plus mu in the
case of M/M/1 queue.

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:53.860
If you have an arbitrary change,
why the amount of time

00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:00.260
that it takes is mu sub I. This
is just back to this old

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.540
thing about splitting and

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.110
combining of Poisson processes.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.130
When you have a combined Poisson
process, which is what

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.980
you have here, when you're in
state i, there's a combined

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:18.940
Poisson process, which is
running, which says you go

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.600
right with probability.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.940
Lambda, you go left with
probability mu

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.120
for an M/M/1 queue.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:32.640
And you can look at it in terms
of, first, you see what

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.490
the next state is.

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.500
And then you ask how long did
it take to get there?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.590
Or you look at in terms of how
long does it take to make a

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.910
transition and then which
state did you go to?

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.820
And with these combined Poisson
processes, those two

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.550
questions are independent
of each other.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.990
And if there's one thing you
remember from all of this,

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.150
please remember that.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.420
Because it's something that
you use in almost every

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.010
problem that you do with Markov

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:04.990
chains and Markov processes.

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.730
It just comes up all the time.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:15.710
This final version here is
looking at the same Markov

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:23.090
process, but looking at it in
sample time instead of looking

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:24.820
at the embedded queue.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.110
Now the important thing here
is, when you look at it in

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.340
sample time, you might not
be able to do this.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:40.010
Because with this entire
cannibal state Markov chain,

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.950
you might not be able to
define these self-loop

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.450
transition probabilities.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.220
Because these numbers
might get too large.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.700
But for the M/M/1 queue,
you can do it.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.500
The important thing is that the
steady state probabilities

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.780
you find for these states are
not the same as the steady

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.300
state probabilities you find for
the embedded Markov chain.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.930
They are in fact the same as the
steady state probabilities

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.330
for the Markov process itself.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:11.880
That's these steady state
probabilities are the fraction

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.980
of time that you spend
in state j.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:18.580
And this is a sample time
Markov process.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.570
It is the same fraction of time
you spend in state j.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:25.040
Here you have this
embedded chain.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.250
And for example, in the embedded
chain, the only place

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:32.190
you go from state
0 is state 1.

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.120
Here from state 0, you
can stay in state

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.680
0 for a long time.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.400
Because here the increments
of time are constant.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:47.530
We can look at delayed renewal
reward theorems for the

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:52.610
renewal process to see what's
going on here, for the

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:56.260
fraction of time we
spend in state j.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.570
We look at that picture
up there.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.580
We start out in state
j, for example.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.930
Same as the renewal reward
process that we had for a

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.280
Markov chain.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.020
We got a reward of 1 for the
amount of time that we

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.800
stay in state j.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.810
After that, we're wandering
around in the wilderness.

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:17.580
We finally come back
to state j again.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.230
We get 1 unit of reward
times the amount of

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.560
time we spend here.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.580
In other words, we're
accumulating reward at a rate

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.540
of 1 unit per unit time,
up to there.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:36.690
So the average reward we get per
unit time is the expected

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:44.790
value of U of j divided by the
expected interrenewal time,

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:49.320
which is 1 over mu j times the
expected time, from one

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.230
renewal to the next.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.710
Which tells us that the fraction
of time we spend in

01:03:56.710 --> 01:04:02.340
state j is equal to the fraction
of transitions that

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.480
go to state j, divided by the
rate at which we leave state

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.970
j, times the expected
number of overall

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:13.220
transitions per unit time.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.330
This is an important result.

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.700
Because depending on what M sub
i is, depending on what

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.360
the number of transitions per
unit time is, it really tells

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.580
you what's going on.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.140
Because all of these bizarre
Markov processes that we've

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:33.520
looked at are bizarre because of
the way that this behaves.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.405
This can infinite or can be 0.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:54.210
At this point, we've been
talking about the expected

01:04:54.210 --> 01:05:01.100
number of transitions per unit
time as a random variable, as

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.770
a limit in probability
1, given that we

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.790
start in state i.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:10.270
And suddenly, we see that it
doesn't depend on i at all.

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:14.150
So there is some number, M bar,
which is the expected

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.900
number of transitions per unit
time, which is independent of

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.210
what state we started in.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:26.970
We call that M M bar instead
M sub I. And that's this

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:29.300
quantity here.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:38.600
And what we get from that it
is the fraction of time we

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:44.330
spend in state j is
proportional to pi

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.310
j over mu sub j.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.250
But since it has to add up to
1, we have to divide it by

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.080
this quantity here.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.330
And this quantity here
is one over--

01:05:56.330 --> 01:06:00.325
this is the expected number of
transitions per unit time.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:09.710
And if we try to get the pi sub
j's from P sub j's, the

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:13.440
corresponding thing, as we find
out, the expected number

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.300
transitions per unit time as
a sum over i, P sub i,

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.330
times mu sub i.

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:23.640
You can play all sorts of games
with these equations.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.685
And when you do so, all of those
things become evident.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:49.460
I would advise you to just
cross this equation out.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.380
I don't know what
it came from.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.300
But it doesn't mean anything.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.700
We spent a lot of time talking
about what happens when the

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.770
expected number of transitions
per unit time

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:10.020
is either 0 or infinity.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:15.870
We had this case we looked at of
an M/M/1 type queue, where

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:19.150
the server got rattled
as time went on.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.010
And the server got rattled
with more and

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.700
more customers waiting.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.590
The customer's got discouraged
and didn't come in.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:31.090
So we had a process where the
longer the queue got, the

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.965
longer time it took for
anything to happen.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.130
So that as far as the embedded
Markov chain went,

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:47.550
everything was fine.

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:52.010
But then we looked at the
process itself, the time that

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:55.140
it took in each of these higher
order states was so

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:00.360
large, that, as a process,
it didn't make any sense.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.330
So the P sub i's were all 0.

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:04.140
The pi sub i's all
looked fine.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.300
And the other kind of cases,
where the expected number of

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.070
transitions per unit time
becomes infinite.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:18.080
And that's just the opposite
kind of case, where, when you

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.170
get to the higher ordered
states, things start happening

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.510
very, very fast.

01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:26.310
The higher ordered state you
go to, the faster the

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.520
transitions occur.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.770
It's like a small child.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.890
I mean, the more excited the
small child gets, the faster

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:37.040
things happen.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.670
And the faster things
happen, the more

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:40.050
excited the child gets.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:43.450
So pretty soon things are
happening so fast, the child

01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:44.790
just collapses.

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:47.330
And if you're lucky,
the child sleeps.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:49.689
So you can think
of it that way.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.529
We talked about reversibility.

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:03.350
And reversibility for Markov
processes I think is somewhat

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.170
easier to see then

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.115
reversibility for Markov chains.

01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:15.660
If you're dealing with a Markov
process, we're sitting

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.790
in state i for a while.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:20.380
At some time we make
a transition.

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.529
We go to state j.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.689
We sit there for a long time.

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.819
Then we go to state
k and so forth.

01:09:26.819 --> 01:09:30.210
If we try to look at this
process coming back the other

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:34.740
way, we see that we're
in state k.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.930
At a certain point, we
had a transition.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.779
We had a transition
into state j.

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.550
And how long does it
take before that

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:43.819
transition is over?

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.340
We're in state j, so the amount
of time that it takes

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.510
is an exponentially distributed
random variable.

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.610
And it's exponentially
distributed with the same

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:58.360
amount of time, whether we're
coming in this way or whether

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.160
we're coming in this way.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.560
And that's the notion
of reversibility.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.840
It doesn't make any difference
whether you look at it from

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.380
right to left or from
left to right.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:16.620
And in this kind of situation,
if you find the steady state

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:23.120
probabilities for these
transitions or you find the

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:29.180
steady state fraction of time
you spend in each state.

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.920
I mean, we just showed that if
you look at this process going

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.630
backwards, if you define all
the probabilities coming

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:40.700
backwards, the expected amount
of time that you spend in

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.650
state i or the rate for leaving
state i is independent

01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:46.010
of right to left.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:49.110
And a slightly more complicated
argument says the

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:52.140
P sub i's are the same
going right to left.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.400
And the fraction of time you
spend in each state is

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.830
obviously the same going
from right to left as

01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:59.490
these limits occur.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:05.980
So that gives you all these
bizarre conditions for

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.570
queuing, which are
very useful.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.080
I'm not going to say any
more about that except

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.280
the guessing theorem.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.940
The guessing theorem says
suppose a Markov process is

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.980
irreducible.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.690
You can check pretty
easily whether it's

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:31.830
irreducible or not.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.910
You can't necessarily
check very easily

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:36.170
whether it's recurrent.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.160
And suppose P sub i is a set
of probabilities that

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:48.530
satisfies P sub i times
Q sub ij equals P sub

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:50.830
j times Q sub ji.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:56.520
In other words, this is the
probability of being in state

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.690
i, and the next transition
is to state j.

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.640
This is the probability of being
in state j, and the next

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.600
transition to state i.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.500
This says that if you can find
a set of probabilities which

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.740
satisfy these equations, and
if they also satisfy this

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:20.640
condition, P sub i, mu sub i,
less than infinity, then P sub

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.030
i is greater than 0 for all i.

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:26.430
P sub i is a steady state time
averaged probability state i.

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.340
The processes is reversible.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.930
And the embedded chain is
positive recurring.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.580
So all you have to do is
solve those equations.

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.760
And if you can solve those
equations, you're done.

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:43.120
Everything is fine.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.680
You don't have to know anything
about reversibility

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.330
or renewal theory or
anything else.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.210
If you have that theorem,
you just

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:53.300
solve for those equations.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:57.710
Solve these equations by
guessing what the solution is,

01:12:57.710 --> 01:13:00.430
and then you in fact have
a reversible process.

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:10.530
So the useful application of
this is that all birth-death

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:15.890
processes are reversible if this
equation is satisfied.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:19.330
And you can immediately
find the steady state

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:20.580
probabilities of them.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.276
I'm not going to have much
time for random walks.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.880
But random walks are
what we've been

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.490
talking about all term.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.500
We just didn't call them random
walks until we got to

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.180
the seventh chapter.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.140
But a random walk is a sequence
of random variables,

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:47.490
where each Sn in the sequence
is a sum of some number of

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:52.330
underlying IID random variables,
X1 up to X sub n.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:56.780
Well we're interested in
exponential bounds on S sub n

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.600
for large n.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.910
These are known as
Chernoff bounds.

01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:03.560
We talked about them back
in chapter one.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.320
I'm not going to mention
them again now.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.860
We're interested in threshold
crossings.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.460
If you have two thresholds, one
positive threshold, one

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:16.120
negative threshold, you would
like to know what's the

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.810
stopping time when S sub
n first crosses alpha?

01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:23.960
Or what's the stopping time when
it first crosses beta?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.210
What's the probability of
crossing alpha before you

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.930
cross beta or vice versa?

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:33.760
And what's the distribution of
the overshoot, when you pass

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760
one of them?

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.120
So there all those questions.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.890
We pretty much talked
about the first two.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:45.480
The question of overshoot,
I think I mentioned this.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.460
The text doesn't say
much about it.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:52.090
Overshoot is just a nasty,
nasty problem.

01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.250
If you ever have to find the
overshoot of something, go

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:59.570
look for a computer program to
simulate it or something.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:02.760
You're not going to solve
the problem very easily.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:08.030
Fowler is the only book I know
which does a reasonable job of

01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:09.720
trying to solve this.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.170
And you have to be
extraordinarily patient.

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:17.030
I mean Fowler does everything
in the nicest possible way.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.330
Or at least he always seem to
do everything in the nicest

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.810
possible way.

01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:23.970
Most textbooks you look at,
after you understand the

01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:27.110
subject, you look at and you
say, oh, he should have done

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:28.570
it this way.

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.910
I've never had that experience
with Fowler at all.

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:33.530
Always, I look at it.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.370
I say, oh, there's an
easier way to do it.

01:15:35.370 --> 01:15:36.990
I try to do it the easier way.

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.800
And then I find something's
wrong with it.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.620
And then I go back and say,
ah, I got to do it the way

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.530
Fowler did it.

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:48.590
So if you're serious about this
field and you don't have

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.730
a copy of this very
old book, get it,

01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:53.190
because it's solid gold.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.450
Suppose a random variable has a
moment generating function,

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:11.470
expected value of E to
the zr over some

01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:13.180
positive region of r.

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:17.270
And suppose it has a mean
which is negative.

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:22.570
The Chernoff bound says that for
any alpha greater than 0

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:27.860
and any r in 0 to r plus, the
probability that Z is greater

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.040
than or equal to alpha is
less than or equal to

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:31.860
this quantity here.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.370
You remember, we derived this.

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:36.730
The derivation is very simple.

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.660
It's a an obvious result.

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.740
It's a little strange.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:48.130
Because this says that for
this random variable it's

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:52.130
complimentary distribution
function has to go down as e

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:55.270
to the minus r alpha.

01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:59.330
Now all random variables can't
go down exponentially as e to

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:01.260
the minus r alpha.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:06.310
The reason for this is that
these moment generating

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:09.050
functions down exist
for all alpha.

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:14.150
So what it's really saying is
where it exists, it goes down

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:17.700
with alpha as e to the
minus r alpha.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.160
We then define the
semi-invariant moment

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.920
generating function.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.000
And then a more convenient way
of stating the Chernoff bound

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
was in this way.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.210
You look here.

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:35.800
And you say, for a fixed value
of n here, this probability of

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.320
S sub n is greater than or equal
to n a, is something

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.540
which is going down
exponentially with n.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.680
And if you optimize over
r, this bound is

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.340
exponentially tight.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:54.110
In other words, if you try to
replace this with anything

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:58.090
smaller, namely which goes down
faster, than for large

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.090
enough n, the bound
will be false.

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:04.870
So this is the tightest bound
you can get when you

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:07.170
optimize it over r.

01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:10.220
So its exponential in n.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.970
Mostly we wanted to use it
for threshold crossings.

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:20.630
And for threshold crossings, we
would like to look at it in

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.860
another way.

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.680
And we dealt with this
graphically.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.470
Probability of Sn greater
than or equal to alpha.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.240
Now what we want to do is
hold alpha constant.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.350
Alpha is some threshold
up there.

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:39.060
We want to ask, what's the
probability that after n

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.780
trials, we're sitting
above alpha?

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.460
And we'd like to try
to solve that for

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.580
different values of n.

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:50.560
The Chernoff bound, in this
case, this quantity here is

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.470
this intercept here.

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:54.950
You take the semi-invariant
moment

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:57.270
generating function as convex.

01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:59.640
You draw this curve.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.290
You take a tangent of
slope alpha over n.

01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:06.420
And you see where
it hits here.

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.290
And this is the exponent
that you have.

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.730
This is a negative exponent.

01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:16.400
As you very n, this tilts
around on this curve.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.520
And it comes in to this point.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.230
It goes back out again.

01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:24.670
That's what happens to it.

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:31.190
And that smallest exponent, as
you vary n, is the most likely

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:34.680
time at which you're going
to cross that threshold.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.930
And what we found,
from looking at

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:41.570
Wald's equality is that--

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:46.000
let me go on, because we're
running out of time.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:54.390
Wald's identity for two
thresholds says this.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:58.930
And the corollary says, if the
underlying random variable is

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:06.580
less than 0, and if the
r at which the--

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:10.260
the second solution of
gamma of r equals 0.

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.000
You have this convex curve.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.450
Gamma is always equal to 0.

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:19.380
There's some other value of r,
for which gamma is equal to 0.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.370
And that's r star.

01:20:21.370 --> 01:20:25.080
And this says that the
probability that we have

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:29.830
crossed alpha at time j, where
j is the time of first

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.310
crossing, is less than
or equal e to the

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.270
minus alpha r star.

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.780
This bound is tight also.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.460
And that's a very nice result.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:42.830
Because that just says that all
you got do is find r star.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:45.810
And that tells you what the
probability of crossing a

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.210
threshold is.

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:50.060
And it's a very tight bound
if alpha is very large.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.780
It doesn't make any difference
what the negative threshold

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:56.230
is, or whether it's
there or not.

01:20:56.230 --> 01:20:59.660
This tells you the thing
you want to know.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:04.610
I think I'm going to stop at
that point, because I have

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.330
been sort of rushing to
get to this point.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.210
And it doesn't do any good
to keep rushing.

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:16.610
So thank you all for being
around all term.

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.540
I appreciate it.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:18.790
Thank you.

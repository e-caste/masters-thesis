CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to continue
our discussion of--

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.023 align:middle line:90%
is it 1M or 2?

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:28.523 align:middle line:90%
It's 1.

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:31.694 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Of the Riemann integral, which,
remember, from the discussion

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
last lecture, is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.345 align:middle line:84%
a theory of area underneath
the graph of a function.

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:90%
So what is that theory?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The theory is built
up as follows.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Given a continuous function f--

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
so this is just a refresher
on the definitions

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I introduced last time--

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
a partition is just
points between--

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
just breaking up the interval
from a to b into points,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
into little subintervals, with
the norm of this partition

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
being the length of the
longest subinterval [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:90%
which we refer to as a tag.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just a set
of points with one

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
lying in each of
these subintervals--

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
so for me, let's take them
all to be the right endpoint

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:90%
of these intervals--

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and then associated to a
tagged partition, which

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is a pair, x and [? xe. ?]
We associated a Riemann sum,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.363 align:middle line:84%
which is f evaluated at
these points times the length

00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
of the interval.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we draw the graph
of a function f and--

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
say, in this picture--

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
this number this
Riemann sum would then

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
be equal to the area of
these three boxes here.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And so our theory of
Riemann integration,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
or our theory of the area
underneath the curve,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
is built on the following
goal, which is to show that,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
as these partitions
get finer and finer,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
as the norm of these
partitions goes to 0,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:84%
these Riemann sums should
converge to some number.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And that number, which we call
the Riemann integral of f,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
we interpret as the area
underneath the graph of f.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:90%
So the first goal--

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
the main goal, really,
to start off with--

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is to show that this
is a reasonable--

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually true that,
these Riemann sums do, in fact,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
converge to some
number as they become

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
finer and finer for a
given continuous function.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
main theorem, which

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I think is going to be the
main thing that we prove today.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So theorem of the
Riemann integral,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:90%
which is the following--

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
let f be a continuous
function from a b to r--

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
which, remember,
this is the notation

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:90%
we used from last time.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me move my
picture over here.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists a
unique real number, which

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
we denote as the usual
symbol, integral a b f

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of x dx with the
following property--

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for every sequence
of partitions xr cr,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:84%
such that the norm of these
partitions is going to 0 as r

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity-- so
these partitions are

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
getting finer and finer
if the norm is going to 0.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the norm is the length
of the longest subinterval

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So for all sequence
of partitions,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
with norms converging
to 0, we have

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that the limit of
the Riemann sums

00:05:44.880 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
exists and equals
this number, which

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
we refer to as the
Riemann integral of f.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.866 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot to unpack here.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
First off, what this
number, integral from a b

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to f of x dx-- this
property that it has is,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
sequence of partitions

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
you take, as long as they're
becoming finer and finer,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
this limit actually exist,
and it equals the same number.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It equals this number,
integral a b f of x dx.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So I could take two different
sequences of partitions

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
becoming finer and finer,
look at the Riemann sums,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and those two sequences
of Riemann sums converge,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and they converge
to the same number--

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.765 align:middle line:84%
again, which we denote
by integral a b f

00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of x dx, the Riemann
integral of f.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this
number, which we

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
interpret as the area
underneath the graph of f.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.915 align:middle line:84%
All right, so our main goal for
today is to prove this theorem.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So first off, there's two
parts of the statement here.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
There exists a
unique real number,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
which we denoted by
that with this property.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Uniqueness is immediate.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
If I have two real
numbers, such that,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
for all sequence of partitions
with norm going to 0,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
the limit of the
Riemann sums equals

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that limit, well, limits
of sequences are unique,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, those two
numbers have to be the same.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So uniqueness is clear.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really the existence
part that we have to prove,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
that there exists a
real number so that,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
no matter what sequence
of partitions we take,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the corresponding Riemann
sums converges to 0--

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%
as long as they become--

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the partitions become
finer and finer.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not going to
prove this theorem just yet.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We need some facts that
will be used in the proof,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
put off proving

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
this theorem for a few
minutes and first prove

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:90%
some necessary facts.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
So let me first define a useful
metric or number associated

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to-- or function associated to
a continuous function called

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:90%
the modulus of continuity.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So for f continuous
function and eta positive,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
we define the modulus
continuity omega f of eta--

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the supremum of
f of x minus f of y [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
absolute value, such that the
absolute value of x minus y

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to [? eta. ?] OK?

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So what does this modulus
of continuity measure?

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It measures, given-- if I
take any two points less than

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
or equal to eta in distance,
and I look f of x minus f of y

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
in absolute value, and
take the sup over all that,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that gives me the
modulus of continuity.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, let's
do the simplest example

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:84%
possible, f of x
equals ax plus b.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Then what do we get?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:90%
f of x minus f of y--

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.515 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to
a times x minus y.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So if x minus y is less
than or equal to eta,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:84%
we get that f of x minus
f of y in absolute value

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to--

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
well, it's equal to
a times x minus y

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to a times eta.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, absolute
value of a times eta

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for this
set for this function.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's also achieved.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
If I take absolute value
of x minus y equal to eta,

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:90%
then this will be equality.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is
that, for this example,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
for f equals ax plus b,
the modulus of continuity

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is equal to a absolute
value of a times eta.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, something to note here is
that, for this guy right here,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.955 align:middle line:84%
as eta goes to 0, the modulus
of continuity goes to 0 as well.

00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is not special
to this function.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's true for
all continuous functions.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So let me state the
theorem and then give you

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:90%
an interpretation of it.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this theorem 1.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So for all f continuous on the
closed and bounded interval

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
in a, b, limit as eta goes to
0 of omega f of eta equals 0.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So let me make one
more comment here.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.712 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this will also--

00:12:29.712 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
just to connect to
something we did

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:84%
earlier, which
follows immediately

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:84%
from the definition of this
guy, that for all x and y,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
this is true.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
should think of,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to make this small,
then the modulus of continuity

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is something that controls
how close f of x and f of y

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:90%
are together.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So somehow continuity is
controlled by this function,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:90%
the modulus of continuity.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.595 align:middle line:90%
So if this goes to 0, then--

00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
as this goes to
0, this goes to 0,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.295 align:middle line:84%
then somehow I'm saying
f of x and f of y

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.295 align:middle line:90%
are very close together.

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
modulus of continuity

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is a way of measuring
continuity of a function.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to think of it.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:43.476 align:middle line:90%
All right, so let's prove this.

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a limited statement,
and what we're going to do

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is we'll just prove it
the old-fashioned way.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
What do we know
about functions which

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
are continuous on a closed
and bounded interval?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
While, they're also
uniformly continuous.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So since f is continuous on this
closed and bounded interval,

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
f is uniformly continuous.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
This means that there
exists delta 0 positive,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
such that, for all x and y,
x and y less than delta 0

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:43.557 align:middle line:84%
implies that f of x minus
f of y is less than--

00:14:43.557 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:90%
let me put epsilon over 2.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give myself
a little space here.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So just to recall,
what we're trying

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to do here in terms of the
definition of what this means--

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to show that,
for all epsilon positive,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:09.965 align:middle line:84%
there exists delta positive,
such that, for all eta--

00:15:09.965 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
eta's actually a positive
number here, so--

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
implies omega of eta
is less than epsilon.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.794 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this is what
we're trying to prove.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We know that, for a
continuous function,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
it's uniformly continuous,
and therefore, there exists

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is delta 0 so that, when x
minus y is less than delta 0,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
f of x minus f of y is less
than epsilon over 2 for all

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:90%
x, y in the interval.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I'm
going to choose delta

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:08.568 align:middle line:84%
to be this delta 0, the
delta I need for this.

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:09.985 align:middle line:84%
And now let me
show that it works.

00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Suppose eta is less than delta,
which, remember, is delta 0.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Then, if x minus y
is less than eta--

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:90%
which, again, is less than--

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to eta,
which is less than delta 0--

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I get that f of x minus f of
y is less than epsilon over 2.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I just rewrote
what I had right there.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this implies
that epsilon over 2 is an upper

00:16:50.860 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
bound for the set f of x
minus f of y, x minus y,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
which is less than eta, which
implies that the supremum

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of this set-- which
is, by definition--

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
put brackets here,

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that's clear that
I'm referring to this set

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:90%
here when I put that here--

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that the supremum
of this set has

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to be less than or equal
to this upper bound, which

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven that, if
eta is less than delta,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
then the modulus of
continuity of f--

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:90%
of eta is less than epsilon.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.225 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this is
what we wanted to prove.

00:17:49.225 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
one fact that I need,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that this modulus of
continuity-- which, remember,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
is the supremum of the
difference of f of x and f

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of y, as long as x and
y are bounded by eta--

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that this converges
to 0 as eta converges

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to 0 for all
continuous functions.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is key in showing that
the Riemann integral exists

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
for continuous functions.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So theorem two is the following.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
tell us how two Riemann

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
sums are comparable
if one partition is

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%
finer than the other.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I have two tagged
partitions of a, b,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
such that x prime
is a subset of x--

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:90%
so this means that x prime--

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
so this is a partition--
a breakup of a, b--

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that contains all the
points of x and more.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's a finer partition.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And we refer to x prime as a
refinement of the partition x.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we
have two partitions.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
One is finer than the other,
and a continuous function f.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we can estimate the
difference in the Riemann sums.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to the modulus of continuity

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
of f evaluated at the
norm of the courser

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.305 align:middle line:84%
partition times the
length of the interval.

00:20:36.305 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this says, as long as--

00:20:53.950 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
one way to think about it is,
if the partition x is very fine,

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I take a finer
partition, that's not

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
going to change the
Riemann sum too much,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
because remember,
this is converging

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to 0 as the norm of the
partition-- how fine it is,

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or you can think how coarse
it is-- is going to 0.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the idea is very simple.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to take me a
little bit just to write down.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, this partition
being contained in the other

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
means this partition has all the
points in x and then some more.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to break
these partitions up into--

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
or at least this
one up into parts

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
where it's points in x and
then plus the extra one.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.205 align:middle line:90%
So for k equals 1 to n--

00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
so let me draw a picture
first, and then I'll

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
define the concepts that I have.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
partition points of x.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.325 align:middle line:84%
And above I'm going
to write now--

00:22:21.325 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I used to write
[? xe, ?] but I'm

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:84%
going to write the
partition points

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:90%
corresponding to x prime.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So this should be x prime sub
l for some l, because remember,

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:39.315 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] this one is
contained in the other.

00:22:39.315 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So this partition point will
be x prime sub l for some l.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll have
some other ones,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and so on, until I
reach the last partition

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
point from x prime,
which is contained

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.856 align:middle line:84%
in this subinterval
from the partition x.

00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:06.356 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:06.356 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.245 align:middle line:90%
So I let y with a k upper--

00:23:15.245 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the partition
x sub k minus 1 equals x prime l

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
plus 1, until I get to
some partition point x sub

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:90%
m, which equals x sub k.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a part of the
partition x prime, contained

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:84%
in this subinterval, where
these are partition points in x.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to write eta k.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
This will be the tags that
come with these points.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
draw attention to is

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that the tagged partition
x, prime c prime--

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to let
me write it this way.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Since these are sets
what I mean by--

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:84%
let me write it as the union
of the tagged partitions.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And also, this eta has nothing
to do with the eta from before.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm just using this as notation.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So the full partition of
x prime and [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
prime tagged partition is equal
to the union of these smaller

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
partitions of xk minus 1 and
xk as k runs from 1 to k.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:90%
I hope that's clear.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now let's compare
the part of the agreement

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.617 align:middle line:84%
Riemann for x [? xe ?]
on this interval.

00:25:16.617 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So remember, somewhere
sitting in here

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:84%
is the tag corresponding to
the k-th tag for this guy.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare it to the
part of the Riemann sum

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:84%
for the x prime [? xe ?] prime
also coming from this interval.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let me
make one more remark

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that, since this
tagged partition is

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
equal to the union of
these tagged partitions,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:84%
this implies that
the Riemann sum

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
this tagged partition

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the sum
of the Riemann sums

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to these
partitions of these intervals,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
xk minus 1 and xk.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are not
partitions of a, b,

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
but they are partitions
of xk minus 1 and xk.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:90%
So I hope all this is clear.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm just breaking this
Riemann sum up into parts where

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
now I'm looking at what's
happening between each

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
of the partition
points x sub k minus 1

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and x sub k coming from the
original courser partition x.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.945 align:middle line:90%
Now we compute.

00:26:49.945 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is a part
of the Riemann sum

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:84%
of x [? xe ?] from this interval
minus the part of the agreement

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
some for x prime [? xe ?] prime
coming from this interval.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is equal
to f of [? xe ?] k.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.855 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just
rewrite this sum here.

00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
x sub k minus x sub
k minus 1-- this

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is equal to sum from k equals,
let's say, j equals l plus 1

00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to m x prime sub j minus
[? x of ?] [INAUDIBLE] minus 1.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So of the smaller ones
that are in there,

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
this is just a telescoping sum.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So all I pick up is x sub j
prime sub m, which is x sub k,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
minus the first one, which
is x sub-- x prime sub l,

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
which is x sub k
minus 1, minus--

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and then this is, by definition,
equal to j equals l plus 1

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] f of prime j,
x prime j minus x minus 1--

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and then a absolute value
sign on the outside.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I combine
these two, and--

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to sum from
j equals l plus 1 to k of k

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
minus j times x prime j
minus x prime j minus 1--

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.865 align:middle line:90%
absolute value.

00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.968 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the triangle inequality,
the absolute value of the sum

00:29:17.968 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
sum of the absolute value.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.143 align:middle line:90%
So save myself writing--

00:29:22.143 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring the
absolute values inside.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, [? xe ?] sub
k and xe sub j--

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
they're both in the interval
x sub k, x sub k minus 1.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And by what I wrote up
there, another way of--

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
or what follows simply
from the definition

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of the modulus of continuity--
this is less than or equal

00:29:51.580 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to omega f of x
sub k [? x sub ?]

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:14.275 align:middle line:84%
k minus 1 times x times j
minus x prime j minus 1.

00:30:14.275 --> 00:30:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And this equals-- now,
this doesn't depend on j,

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
so this is, again just
a telescoping sum.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:90%
So I just pick up times x--

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
so that's for one piece,
and now I just add them up.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Then I look at--

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and so like I said, this is
equal to the sum of these terms

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that look like this
from k equals 1 to n.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the sum
of terms like this from k

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.840 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 to n.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wrote up there.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And so if I apply the
triangle inequality,

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or equal to
sum from k equals 1 to n of f

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:37.990 align:middle line:84%
of [? xe ?] k times xk minus
xk minus 1 minus s [? sub ?] f

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.805 align:middle line:90%
eta, which--

00:31:42.805 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I have this estimate right here.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I've already estimated--
so started off with this.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I showed it was less
than or equal to this.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So now let me stick that
estimate into here--

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to sum
from k equals 1 to n omega

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:17.635 align:middle line:84%
f of xk minus xk minus 1
times xk minus xk minus 1.

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:20.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
which you should

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
notice about the
modulus of continuity

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
is, if I have something here
and then something bigger,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
this set gets bigger,
and therefore, this sup

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
gets bigger.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So another property of
the modulus of continuity

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:90%
is that it's increasing.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
This just follows from
looking at the definition.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
There's more points
to take a sup over

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
f this thing gets bigger.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:90%
So implies-- OK?

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So all of these lengths of
these subintervals, the distance

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
between partition
points, those are all

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
bounded by the norm of the
partition, the biggest one.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or equal to
sum from k equals 1 to n omega

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
f of norm of x times
xk minus xk minus 1.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, this
doesn't depend on k,

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
so I just pick up the
sum from k equals 1 to n

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of this, which is
a telescoping sum.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:54.310 align:middle line:84%
All I pick up is x sub n minus x
sub 0, which is just b minus a,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.305 align:middle line:84%
which is the estimate
we wanted to prove.

00:33:56.305 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.505 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:02.505 --> 00:34:04.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I'm going to do
something that's sacrilegious,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:90%
as far as board work goes.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
erase this board

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and prove the next
theorem on it, because I

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:90%
want to keep what I prove--

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.719 align:middle line:84%
or at least a statement
of what I prove around

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:84%
for when we finally tackled
the proof of the existence

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Riemann integral.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is in
permanent form on--

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
in digital form, and
also in the notes.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, I should mention, we're
not following the textbook now.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have to read the lecture
notes or watch the lecture.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this
theorem here, theorem two,

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to compare
two Riemann sums,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
as long as one partition
is finer than the other.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's a simple
trick which we can now

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
use to prove how to compare any
two Riemann sums for any two

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:90%
partitions.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:24.755 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
following, theorem three.

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:84%
If xc and-- now they're
any tagged partitions--

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and f is a continuous
function, then

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I look at the Riemann
sum of this guy

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it to the
Riemann sum of the other guy.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to the modulus of continuity

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:84%
evaluated at the first partition
plus modulus of continuity

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:84%
applied to the second
partition times the length

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of the interval.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.120 align:middle line:90%
What does this say?

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.890 align:middle line:84%
This says that, if I take
two very fine partitions,

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:84%
so that the norms
are very small,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the modulus
of continuity evaluated

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
at these norms a
small-- remember,

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
the modulus of continuity
converges to 0 as the argument

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:90%
goes to 0.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So if I take two
very fine partitions,

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:84%
then the Riemann sums
are very close together.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
The Riemann sums barely change.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have some hope to
see that sequences of Riemann

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:90%
sum do, in fact, converge.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.790 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, so how do we prove this?

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple trick using
the previous theorem

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to find a third partition
to be the common refinement

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:90%
of these two.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So take this partition and
union it with the second one,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and take a new set of tags to
be the union of the two tags.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So all the partition
points of x and x prime--

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I throw them together to get a
new partition, x double prime--

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and then the tags as well.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Then x-- backwards--

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:84%
this new partition
is finer than x.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:90%
It's finer than x prime.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by
theorem two, we

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
have this estimate
which we can use.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at the difference
of the Riemann sums,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and I add and subtract the
Riemann sum corresponding to x

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:84%
double prime and
[? xe ?] double prime,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and then I use the
triangle inequality--

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle line:90%
so I'm doing two steps here--

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:84%
so add and subtract the
Riemann sum corresponding to--

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and then apply the
triangle inequality.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
For both of these,
I can now insert

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:84%
this estimate here from
theorem two, where--

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
what's the modulus of
continuity being evaluated at?

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's being evaluated at
the courser partition.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So x double prime is contained
in x, so this is less than

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the modulus
of continuity evaluated

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:90%
at x prime times b minus a.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, for this one, x prime
is coarser than x double prime.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
This one is contained
in x prime-- so

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:84%
plus the modulus of continuity
evaluated at x prime times b

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.032 align:middle line:90%
minus a.

00:40:15.032 --> 00:40:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
wanted to prove.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:21.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.878 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:24.420 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now
we're in a position

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:29.145 align:middle line:84%
to prove this theorem
of the Riemann integral.

00:40:29.145 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going
to do is we're first

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
going to come up with
a candidate for what

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:90%
the integral could be.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
show that's the actual--

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that that candidate
satisfies the conclusion--

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:84%
or this property
that, no matter what

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.950 align:middle line:84%
partition I take, with
norms converging to 0,

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the Riemann sums
converge to this number.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So first we have to come
up with a candidate number.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:90%
So first, take any--

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.785 align:middle line:90%
so let's fix some partition of--

00:41:20.785 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
for the Greek letter aficionados
out there, this is zeta.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:41.932 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Let this be a partition of
a, b with norm converting

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:90%
to 0 as r goes to infinity.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
You can always come up
with some partition.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:90%
So this [INAUDIBLE] tagged.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You can always come up with
one, at least one partition--

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.050 align:middle line:90%
or sequence of partitions.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is [? be a ?]
sequence of tagged partitions.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, now this is finally right.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can always come
up with a sequence

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
of tagged partitions of a, b
with the norms converging to 0.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Take the first one to be
just the whole interval--

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.640 align:middle line:84%
so just left endpoint,
right endpoint.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Next one add-- the midpoint.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:84%
That's now three
partition points.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Now add the midpoint of the
previous two intervals you had.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now add the midpoint
of the intervals

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you had before, and
so on, and that'll

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
build up a sequence of
partitions with norm

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:90%
converging to 0.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So I have this fixed
sequence of tag partitions,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and I claim that the Riemann
sums converge for this guy.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So claim one-- the
sequence of sums--

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.840 align:middle line:84%
this is a sequence
of numbers now--

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:46.205 align:middle line:90%
So it converges to some number.

00:43:46.205 --> 00:43:48.205 align:middle line:84%
We're going to prove this
by showing its Cauchy.

00:43:48.205 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Cauchy sequences of
real numbers always converge.

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That's this completeness
property of the real numbers.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's no other
way to do this.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Then, using the definition--
the epsilon [? m ?] definition--

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:90%
so let epsilon be positive.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So by theorem one, there
exists a delta positive,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:84%
such that if eta is
less than delta--

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I should say-- so we know that
the modulus of continuity for f

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:90%
converges to 0 as eta goes to 0.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So for all eta less than
delta, omega f of eta

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:09.440 align:middle line:84%
is less than epsilon
over 2 times B minus a.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me put a star by this guy.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the norms of
these partitions is--

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:44.300 align:middle line:84%
are converging to 0, there
exists natural number m0 such

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that, for all r bigger
than or equal m0,

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:58.015 align:middle line:90%
the norm is less than delta.

00:45:58.015 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And thus, for all r bigger
than or equal to m0,

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
if I look at the modulus
of continuity evaluated

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:84%
at this norm of this partition--
so the norm of this partition

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.650 align:middle line:90%
is less than delta.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And if I stick that into
the modulus of continuity,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
anything I stick into the
modulus of continuity which is

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.500 align:middle line:84%
less than delta--
which this is--

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I should be less than epsilon
over 2 times b minus a.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So really, this
is the one I want

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.020 align:middle line:90%
to star, maybe not this one.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I am using this one to get it,
but this is the key point here.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So here we're just using the
fact that modulus of continuity

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:84%
converges to 0 as the
argument converges to 0,

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and that the norms
are converging to 0.

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:12.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:28.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So [? to show something's ?]
Cauchy, we

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:34.848 align:middle line:90%
have to now choose m.

00:47:34.848 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to choose m to be m0.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.080 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] r, r prime bigger
than or equal to m-- which,

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.680 align:middle line:90%
remember, we've chosen to m0.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:59.832 align:middle line:84%
We have that the absolute
value of s of f xr--

00:47:59.832 --> 00:48:05.745 align:middle line:84%
r, minus the Riemann
sum, now with r prime--

00:48:05.745 --> 00:48:13.080 align:middle line:90%


00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.490 align:middle line:90%
absolute value.

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:21.800 align:middle line:84%
This is by theorem three,
which we proved over there--

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is bounded by the sum of
the modulus of continuities

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.150 align:middle line:84%
evaluated at the
norms times b minus a.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:47.391 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And now r and r prime are bigger
than or equal to m0, and so

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.210 align:middle line:90%
by star--

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:90%
so this line here.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.750 align:middle line:90%
This is by theorem three.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But now, by star,
by our choice of m0,

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:07.880 align:middle line:84%
this is less than
epsilon over 2 times

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:16.610 align:middle line:84%
b minus a plus epsilon over
2 b minus a times b minus a.

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:22.395 align:middle line:84%
This is now by star,
which equals epsilon.

00:49:22.395 --> 00:49:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
sequence of Riemann

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:33.410 align:middle line:84%
sums with respect to this
one sequence converges.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.030 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:90%
And so we've proven the claim.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me call the limit of
this sequence something.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it L. In fact,
let's call it I for integral.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Let I be limit as r
goes to infinity of--

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:04.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, I messed up my
notation earlier.

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:12.780 align:middle line:84%
The y's, and, x's and [? xe's ?]
should have been y's and zetas.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So that should have been
y, zeta, y, zeta, and then

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.340 align:middle line:90%
y here, y here.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:23.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Now that's right.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:34.555 align:middle line:84%
So I is defined to be
the limit of these guys.

00:50:34.555 --> 00:50:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to do
one last thing in order

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:43.805 align:middle line:90%
to prove the theorem.

00:50:43.805 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I have this number I, and I
claim now that I satisfies

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the properties of
the theorem-- namely,

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that if I take any
sequence of Riemann sums--

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:04.090 align:middle line:84%
or any sequence of
tagged partitions

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and take the Riemann
sums, that converges to I.

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We've just shown that there
is one that converges to.

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how I is defined.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:13.930 align:middle line:90%
We took one partition--

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.630 align:middle line:84%
sequence of tagged partitions
and showed that the Riemann

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.840 align:middle line:84%
sums converge to some
number I. So this number

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I depends on the partition,
which I chose in the beginning.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:30.165 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to show
that this I, in fact,

00:51:30.165 --> 00:51:31.540 align:middle line:84%
has that property,
that no matter

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.710 align:middle line:84%
what partition--
sequence of partitions

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I take the Riemann
sums converge to I.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second
and last thing I need

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to do to prove this theorem.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.590 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.590 --> 00:52:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So claim-- let x be now any
sequence of tagged partitions,

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.940 align:middle line:84%
which are becoming
finer and finer-- so

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:90%
with the norm converging to 0.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:21.780 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I want to show
that limit as r

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.670 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity
of the Riemann sums

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:35.010 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to this
sequence of partial sums--

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.850 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] partial sums--
this sequence of partitions

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:42.270 align:middle line:84%
exists, and equals
this number I,

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:47.840 align:middle line:84%
which I obtained from this
one sequence of partitions.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So once I've proven
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.600 align:middle line:84%
once I've proven
this, then I'm done.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:90%
This number I is therefore--

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:03.272 align:middle line:90%


00:53:03.272 --> 00:53:05.480 align:middle line:84%
satisfies that property
that, no matter what sequence

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of partitions I
take, the sequence

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.870 align:middle line:84%
of Riemann sums with
respect to these partitions

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.705 align:middle line:90%
converges to that number.

00:53:14.705 --> 00:53:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, here
I'm calling it I,

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.580 align:middle line:84%
but we denoted by the integral
from a, b of f of x dx.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So to prove this is
not too difficult using

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.830 align:middle line:90%
what we have on the board.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I is the limit with
respect to this one sequence

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.200 align:middle line:84%
of partitions, and now we
have an arbitrary sequence

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of partitions, which we want to
show the Riemann sums converge

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:90%
to this number as well.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.810 --> 00:54:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So with y sub r-- or yr and zeta
r, the partitions from before,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:90%
we have--

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:07.550 align:middle line:90%


00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
by the triangle
inequality, if I look

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:26.250 align:middle line:84%
at the Riemann sum with
respect to this arbitrary

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:90%
partition now--

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.720 align:middle line:84%
subtract I-- I want to
show this convergence to 0,

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.240 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
bound this by something

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:90%
that converges to 0.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, by the usual argument
with the squeeze theorem,

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that implies this
thing converges to 0.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So adding and subtracting
the Riemann sum associated

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:90%
to the partition y and zetas--

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:59.150 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or equal to
in the triangle inequality,

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:11.705 align:middle line:84%
minus sf of
[INAUDIBLE] plus now--

00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.930 align:middle line:90%
minus I.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm almost there.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.050 align:middle line:84%
This thing now-- I
use theorem three.

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.715 align:middle line:84%
So this is less
than or equal to--

00:55:28.715 --> 00:55:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.600 align:middle line:90%
times b minus a plus--

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:06.170 align:middle line:90%
s sub f of i sub r minus I. OK?

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.330 align:middle line:84%
The norm of the x sub r--
this is converging to 0.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.910 align:middle line:90%
So this converges to--

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:84%
since the modulus of continuity
goes to 0 as the argument goes

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.750 align:middle line:90%
to 0, this goes to 0, plus--

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:35.700 align:middle line:84%
remember, the same
thing for this guy--

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:42.480 align:middle line:90%
this also converges to 0, plus--

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:90%
how did we define I?

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It was defined as the limit of
the Riemann sums corresponding

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to this first fixed partition.

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
thing in absolute value

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:59.130 align:middle line:84%
converges to 0 as r
convergence is to infinity.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the absolute
value of this thing,

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.950 align:middle line:84%
this Riemann sum, minus I is
bounded by something converging

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to 0 as r goes to infinity.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by
the squeeze theorem,

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.595 align:middle line:84%
we conclude that the limit
as r goes to infinity of s--

00:57:23.595 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.510 align:middle line:84%
so in other words, no matter
what sequence of partitions

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:41.000 align:middle line:84%
we take, with norms
converging to 0,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.987 align:middle line:84%
the Riemann sums converge
to this same number I.

00:57:45.987 --> 00:57:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of the proof.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:55.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.685 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:57.685 --> 00:57:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of
work to do this.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the work
of Raymond, so--

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:11.165 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the greatest
mathematicians of all time.

00:58:11.165 --> 00:58:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Weierstrass was definitely
one of the greatest analysts

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Riemann, just as a
mathematician in general,

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.795 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
greatest of all time.

00:58:22.795 --> 00:58:25.636 align:middle line:90%


00:58:25.636 --> 00:58:27.390 align:middle line:90%
He not only did analysis--

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.170 align:middle line:84%
he applied analysis
to number theory.

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:38.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the content of the
famous Riemann hypothesis,

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.750 align:middle line:84%
which maybe you've
heard about, which

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.740 align:middle line:90%
is worth a million dollars--

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:48.520 align:middle line:84%
says something about the zeros
of a certain function, which

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.190 align:middle line:84%
then gives you information
about prime numbers.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And he also had
deep contributions

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.040 align:middle line:90%
to the foundations of geometry--

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.710 align:middle line:84%
or I should say the foundations
of differential geometry--

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:11.820 align:middle line:84%
but truly some deep
stuff going on.

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.900 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now we have this
notion of a "remand integral.

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It's this no integral f of
x, which has this property.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.960 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
sequence of partitions

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I take, with norms
converging to 0,

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the partial sums
converge to this number.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So I'm often going to denote--

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:43.685 align:middle line:84%
so if you like, this is some
alternative notation I'll use.

00:59:43.685 --> 00:59:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead of writing f
of x dx, I may just

00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:00.030 align:middle line:90%
write integral a, b, f.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So this definition of the
Riemann integral looks

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
terrifying if you want to
actually try and compute it.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's the miracle of
the fundamental theorem

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.310 align:middle line:84%
of calculus is that it gives
us a way to compute it.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm not doing
any examples of computing it

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.300 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But we can still learn about
some properties of the Riemann

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:32.280 align:middle line:90%
integral without that to start.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So now we're moving on to some
properties of the integral.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.830 align:middle line:90%


01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.620 align:middle line:90%
And the first is that it--

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:47.740 align:middle line:84%
so this is a limiting process,
but this limiting process

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.450 align:middle line:90%
is linear in f.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If I look at Riemann sums
of, let's say, f plus g,

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that's equal to the Riemann sum
of f plus the Riemann sum of g.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.904 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, since
integration is a limit of this--

01:01:03.904 --> 01:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of Riemann sums,
then integration

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.650 align:middle line:90%
should also be linear as well.

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
theorem is the linearity

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Riemann sum,
Riemann integration--

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
f and g are a, b.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%


01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And alpha is in R.

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So first off, alpha f plus
g-- that's going to be--

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.310 align:middle line:90%
so that should not be in a, b.

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
This should be a continuous--

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.600 align:middle line:90%
it's the end of a long day, OK?

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So sorry if I'm losing a little
steam here towards the end.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.567 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, alpha f plus g,
if f and g are continuous--

01:02:02.567 --> 01:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
this is a continuous
function as well,

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:07.110 align:middle line:90%
so its integral is meaningful.

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And its integral is equal to
alpha times the integral f

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:17.030 align:middle line:90%
plus the integral of g.

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.843 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The proof is basically
what I said right

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
before I stated the theorem,
that Riemann sums are

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.020 align:middle line:90%
linear in the function.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:42.102 align:middle line:90%
And then we just take a limit.

01:02:42.102 --> 01:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a sequence
of tagged partitions

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
with norms converting to
0 as r goes to infinity.

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:12.030 align:middle line:90%


01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Then, if I look at the
Riemann sum associated

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
to alpha f plus g, it is easy to
see from the definition, right?

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a sum from k
equals 1 to [? in-- ?]

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
so this is easy to
see that this is

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
equal to alpha times
the Riemann some

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:55.122 align:middle line:90%
associated to f plus that guy.

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.330 align:middle line:90%
And now I just take a limit--

01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.190 align:middle line:84%
so take the limit as
r goes to infinity.

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The left-hand side converges
to the Riemann integral

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.680 align:middle line:90%
of alpha f plus g.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
The limit as r goes to
infinity converges to--

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
because we know limits
respect linear operations,

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the limit of the
right-hand side is

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be alpha times
the limit plus the limit.

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this is equal
to alpha times integral a, b,

01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:35.937 align:middle line:90%
f plus integral a, b, g.

01:04:35.937 --> 01:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%


01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So like differentiation,
it's also

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
what one would call
a linear operator.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It takes a function and
spits something out,

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.565 align:middle line:90%
but does it in a linear way.

01:04:55.565 --> 01:05:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it takes
a continuous function

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and spits out a real
number in a linear way.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The integral of
alpha f plus g is

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
equal to alpha times f plus g.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Just like differentiation, the
derivative of alpha f plus g

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
if everything's
differentiable, is

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
equal to alpha times
the derivative of f

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%
plus the derivative of g.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But Riemann integration,
the Riemann integral,

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:32.075 align:middle line:84%
or integration in general,
is in some sense--

01:05:32.075 --> 01:05:35.260 align:middle line:90%


01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
it's not miraculous.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It still is a bit
of a miracle that it

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
exists for all
continuous functions,

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's not as
destructive an operator

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
as taking the
derivative, if you take

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
as your baseline
continuous functions.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Last lecture we constructed
a continuous function which

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.950 align:middle line:90%
is differentiable nowhere.

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So with differentiation, you
can take a continuous function

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to take
its derivative anywhere.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, with integration,
if you start off

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
with a continuous function, you
can always take it's integral.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So somehow integration is a
much more smoother process

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:24.860 align:middle line:90%
than differentiation.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I think
we'll stop there.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000 align:middle line:90%

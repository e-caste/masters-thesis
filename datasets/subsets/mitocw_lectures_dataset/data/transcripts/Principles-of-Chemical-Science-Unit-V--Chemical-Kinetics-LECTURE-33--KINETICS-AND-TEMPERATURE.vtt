00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:48.930
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
let's show the answer.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.800
All right.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.241
For a special treat,
special benefit--

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:03.490
I'm not sure what to call
it-- something special later

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.900
in the class, does
someone want to tell me

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.164
why that's the right answer?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.820
AUDIENCE: Well as
we did last lecture,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.580
we crossed off the k2
because that's the slow step.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.201
So it doesn't matter as much.

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:27.200
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.770
And so when you get rid of
that, when the k minus 1

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.730
is really fast
compared to k2, k2

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.466
is very small compared to that.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.340
So you get rid of it.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.700
And that simplifies
the expression.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.950
So temperature-- today's lecture
is largely about temperature.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.800
But we're going to
tie in all sorts

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.870
of other things we've
learned over the course

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.840
of the semester.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.760
So I'm very excited.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.170
Some of my very favorite
topics are coming back today.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.650
So effective temperature, we
talked about this a little bit

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.170
when we were talking
about making bread,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.402
adding your baking
soda and about rates

00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.860
and why you put
things in the oven.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.840
And we talked about it has to
do with also the spontaneity,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.260
whether you change
the temperature

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.610
and what your delta
H and delta S are.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.450
But we also talked
about rates and that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.850
increasing the temperature
often increases the rate.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.700
So many of us have
observed this.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.246
You increase the temperature,
you increase the rate.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.870
But today we're going
to talk about how

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.570
you can quantitatively say
how much the rate might

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.930
be changed-- the rate constant
might be changed if you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.810
increase the temperature.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.260
So in 1889, it was a
wonderful day for Arrhenius.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.130
He had been trying to
plot different values

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.110
of rate constants
versus temperature

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.710
to see what would happen.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.060
And then he tried natural
log of the rate constant k

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.670
versus inverse temperature.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.150
And he got a straight line.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.850
And scientists always get
very excited when your data

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.290
falls on a straight line.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.830
It means you figured
out some relationship

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.230
between two values.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.020
So here is the Arrhenius plot.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.590
And we'll introduce some terms.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.560
So again, we're plotting the
natural log of k versus 1

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.880
over temperature, 1 over
inverse kelvin over here.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.460
And here is our plot
of this straight line

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.830
that Arrhenius found.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.510
Natural log of k on
the y-axis versus 1/T

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.470
gives you a slope then of
minus the activation energy--

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.615
so E to the little a is
activation energy-- over R,

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:40.260
our good friend
the gas constant.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.320
And then the
y-intercept over here

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.420
is the natural log
of something called

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.160
A. We have a lot of different
A's in this particular unit

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.090
of kinetics.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.260
This one is factor
A, sometimes called

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.822
the Arrhenius factor,
A for Arrhenius.

00:03:55.822 --> 00:03:57.280
It has a couple of
different names.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
But importantly, it has the same
units as k, our rate constants.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.510
So what this plot told
Arrhenius back in 1889

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.080
was that rate constants
vary exponentially

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.380
with inverse temperature.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.210
So this was the first
kind of connection

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.080
between rate constants
and temperature

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.930
that could be used
to kind of come up

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.640
with quantitative numbers.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.690
So factor A, this Arrhenius
factor, and the activation

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.685
energy, E to the sub a, depend
on the reaction being studied.

00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:30.670
So they have to be measured
for the particular reaction.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.110
So it's a clicker competition.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.840
So we'll have a bunch of
clicker questions today.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.217
And why don't you tell me if you
think factor A is temperature

00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:39.716
dependent?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.340
All right.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.006
10 more seconds.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.090
Yep.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.250
The answer is no.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.860
And so what is this factor A?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.160
If we think about this in
terms of the plot, what it is

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.910
is the rate constant
when 1/T is equal to 0.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.640
Because it is the y-intercept.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.982
And when 1/T is equal to 0,
what has to be true about T?

00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:36.320
Yeah.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.215
Infinitely large.

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:42.500
So factor A is the
rate constant at

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.330
an infinitely large temperature,
at a huge temperature.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.520
So it's the fastest that
particular reaction could ever

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.800
go at this infinitely
huge temperature.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.275
So that's what factor A is.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:56.940
And of course, we
can't plug things in

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.530
and say, how fast is this at
an infinitely huge temperature?

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.820
So conveniently, you
can get that value out

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.310
of plotting your data.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.930
You measure a bunch of rate
constants versus temperature.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.320
And you plot it
this way, and you

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.210
can calculate this sort of
maximum rate constant possible

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.790
for this reaction if
you had this infinitely

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.460
huge temperature.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.245
What about activation energy?

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:23.995
Do you think that's
temperature dependent?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.300
All right.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.195
10 more seconds.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.120
So no, it isn't.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.670
And so if we sort of just
think about it back here,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.600
the answer is no.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.780
Again, you plot
the rate constants

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.720
over all these temperatures to
get one value out of the slope.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.830
So it is largely independent
of any kind of temperature.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.946
You get one activation energy
for the reaction in question.

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:17.820
But it does depend on
the reaction, for sure.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.360
There isn't just one value
for this for everything.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.930
It depends on the materials.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.560
All right.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.090
So let's look at some
other ways that we can

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.260
express the Arrhenius equation.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.170
So we have the
Arrhenius equation

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.320
written as a straight line.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.350
And we can also do something
very, very simple to it,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.820
which is switch these two terms.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.330
And that gives us what
is officially known

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.980
as the Arrhenius equation.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.040
So natural log of k
equals natural log

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.750
of A, this Arrhenius
or factor A,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.350
minus the activation
energy over the gas

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.280
constant times temperature.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.670
And of course, if you
want to solve for k,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.560
you take the inverse
log of both sides.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.830
And so then k is going to be
equal to this factor A-- again,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.200
measured for every reaction
in question-- e to the minus

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.830
Ea, the activation
energy, over RT.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.410
So here is our equations.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.980
These will be on
equation sheets,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.580
so you don't have
to memorize them.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.430
But you already, if you've been
studying your equation sheet

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.450
for exam four,
realize that there's

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.409
a lot of symbols that are
very similar in these units.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:37.760
So we have a, in nuclear
chemistry, activity.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.474
So just keep in mind
what equation is what.

00:08:41.474 --> 00:08:44.059
When you're talking
about nuclear decay,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.300
you don't have your
activation energy term.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.600
So that should give
you somewhat of a clue.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.520
So one of the
challenges in the final

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.590
is making sure you know
which equation is which.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.770
So let's look at an
example now where

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.400
if we're given some
of the information,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.300
we can solve for other things.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.430
So an example, this is
classes at lunch time.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.360
So we can think about the
hydrolysis of an average lunch

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.280
of sucrose to form a
molecule of glucose

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.600
and a molecule of fructose as
part of the digestive process.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.810
So some of you might
have eaten already.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.730
You might be
digesting sucrose-- it

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.230
comes in many different
forms-- right now.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.440
So using the information
about activation energy,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.620
we can predict what
the rate constant

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.840
is going to be at a
different temperature.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.000
So some kind person measured
the activation energy

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.550
for this digestive process
at 108 kilojoules per mole

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.730
and also figured out that
the k observed, observed

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:53.165
rate constant, for this reaction
is 1.0 times 10 to the minus 3

00:09:53.165 --> 00:09:57.080
per mole or per at
normal body temperature.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.750
And so now we're asked
to calculate what

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.050
that rate constant should
be at lower temperature, 35

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.180
degrees Celsius, somewhat
below body temperature.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.540
So how are we going to do that?

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.320
Well, let's remind ourselves
of our equations, our Arrhenius

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.390
equation.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.570
So we know what Ea is.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.150
We were not told what our
Arrhenius factor A is.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.330
We don't know that.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.370
But we do know one
of the rate constants

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.780
at one of the temperatures.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.662
So if we combine
these two equations,

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:30.410
then we have an
appropriate number

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.030
of variables to
solve for the rate

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.490
constant at the new temperature.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.980
So let's combine
those two equations.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.780
So we have natural log
of k2, our rate constant,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.320
at temperature 2
minus the natural log

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.310
of the rate constant
at temperature 1,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.230
which can also be expressed
as natural log rate constant 2

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.080
over rate constant 1.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.010
And our natural log of the
Arrhenius factor drops out.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.310
And so we have minus Ea,
our activation energy,

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.910
over our gas constant times 1
over the temperature minus 1

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.760
over the first temperature.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.900
So we can put in our
values that we're given.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.900
So we have our first
rate constant down here,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.060
the rate constant at
the first temperature.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.910
We put in our
temperatures, making

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.070
sure we convert them to kelvin
because our gas constant is

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.410
in kelvin.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.470
And also, we are going to
convert our activation energy

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.390
from kilojoules to
joules because we

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.230
want to cancel our units.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.790
So now we can cancel joules.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.120
We can cancel moles.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.390
And we can cancel kelvin.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.360
And so that gives us
a new rate constant,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.740
7.6 times 10 to the minus
4 per mole or per second.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.550
And this is a lower rate
at a lower temperature.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.655
And in fact, that is often true.

00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:58.540
You have a lower rate
at a lower temperature.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.180
And this is one of the reasons
why it's a really good idea

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.880
to keep your body temperature
at body temperature.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.400
And around this time of
year, people come in to MIT

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.550
from warmer climates.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.250
And they do not have
appropriate clothing.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.110
And so your body does not
work well in the cold.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.350
The rates slow down.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.720
You're not digesting things.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.669
Your body is really
not doing anything

00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:23.210
at the rate it's
supposed to be doing

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.260
these reactions
because they're nicely

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.800
tuned to the appropriate
body temperature.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.070
So go out and buy a winter coat.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.400
So this now, this equation
that we just derived

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.500
shows us the relationship
between rate constants

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.030
and temperature.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.790
So again, natural log k2 over
k1 minus the activation energy

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.710
over the gas constant
and our temperature term.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.310
And if we look at
this equation, we'll

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.630
realize that if we have a very
large value for this activation

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.850
energy, this Ea term
here, that's going

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.000
to mean that the
rate constants are

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.850
very sensitive to temperature.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.320
If this is small, there
won't be a big difference

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.090
between k1 and k2.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.190
But if the activation
energy is really big,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.490
there will be a big
difference between k1 and k2.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.810
The rate constants will be
very sensitive to temperature.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:20.310
All right.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.230
So now let's think about
rates and temperature.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.130
And let's think of
a cold temperature.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.900
Let's think, for example, of
liquid nitrogen temperatures.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.840
What do you think
happens to an enzyme?

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.070
You have enzymes in
your digestive process

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.940
that are hydrolyzing
sucrose that you

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.370
might have had for lunch.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.900
What do you think
happens to enzymes

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.858
if you put them at liquid
nitrogen temperature?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.820
They will slow way down.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.560
One would say they would
stop working entirely.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.180
They would just sort of
be, we call it frozen.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.020
And in fact, I use this all
the time in my research.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.990
So one thing we do, we study
the structures of proteins.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.170
And so we grow these
lovely protein crystals.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.020
And what we can do, we take
these-- a lot of times,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.580
the proteins or enzymes in
the crystals are active.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.140
They're able to convert
reactants to products.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.760
And so we can soak in reactants
and then take our crystals

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.250
and dunk them in liquid
nitrogen and then

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.740
determine the structure of that.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.670
And if we do it at
different time points,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.920
you can actually kind of
walk through the mechanism

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.890
of the enzyme.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.480
Watch what happens at
various different states.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.850
So this is a very common
thing that's used.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.460
We like to do things
at liquid nitrogen

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.640
to see things sort of--
we sort of pause it

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.140
when it's dumped
in liquid nitrogen.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.240
It stops what it's doing.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.680
And we can capture
its structure.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.005
What do you think about
non-enzymatic reactions?

00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:49.849
Do you think they're also
going to be slowed down?

00:14:49.849 --> 00:14:50.390
I don't know.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.106
Should we do an
experiment and find out?

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:52.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.830
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yeah, I think we should.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.410
So we now have-- let's
bring out our demo TAs.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.440
We now have glow sticks.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.090
Glow sticks are in
fact chemicals in there

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.390
that when you break them,
you have a chemical reaction.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.647
So we're going to do this.

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:15.730
And we're going to break
them and watch them glow.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.630
Let's break them and
put them in here first.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.790
And then we're going to cool
them down and see what happens

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.960
to the chemical reaction.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.000
Here, let's have a
little help over here.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.770
Please break some of these.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.103
AUDIENCE: How do you break them?

00:15:31.252 --> 00:15:32.710
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
You break-- see,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:38.340
you just kind of snap them
and then shake them up.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.540
And I think we'll bring down the
lights so you can all see these

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.180
pretty well.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.590
So now the chemical
reaction is going.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.460
And so we can see the
chemical reaction.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.500
That's what's wonderful
about glow sticks.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.380
You can observe the
chemical reaction

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.895
because it causes it to glow.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.040
Move so everyone can see.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.380
Now we're going to see what
happens to the chemical

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.110
reaction when it slows again.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.236
When the chemical
reaction is slowed down,

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:19.070
you won't see it anymore.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.120
So it'll stop glowing.

00:16:27.144 --> 00:16:27.977
That should be good.

00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:36.120
We'll do all of
them, and we'll see.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.630
It'll take a little bit of time.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.060
But it should not be too long.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.340
And hopefully, it'll slow down
faster than the liquid nitrogen

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.012
destroys the plastic cups.

00:16:55.324 --> 00:16:57.490
Yeah, I think you can see
it with the first one now.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.129
Mary, why don't
you come down here?

00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:07.670
We have something
else for you to do.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.207
Let's put some liquid
nitrogen in here.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.000
Let's bring up the lights
because our glowing

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.630
has stopped.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.180
So another thing
that liquid nitrogen

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.080
changes the properties.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.520
So Mary will demonstrate to
you what happens to a flower.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.575
And just like right now,
the flower does this.

00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:50.010
But let's put it in liquid
nitrogen and see what happens.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.095
Give it a decent soak.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.010
And now smash it.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.718
Thank you very much,
our lovely assistant.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.620
I will brush off
my computer later.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.910
We have more flowers,
and apparently there's

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.750
a broom somewhere.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.170
So if we finish class, for
some lucky other individuals,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.930
you can come down and smash
the rest of the flowers.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.200
So liquid nitrogen really
changes the property of things.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.160
Sometimes it's used
by dermatologists

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.070
to remove warts or other things.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.400
They'll dab some
liquid nitrogen on you.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.410
And I always feel like
paying a lot of money

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.142
to go have that done-- I have
liquid nitrogen around my lab.

00:18:49.142 --> 00:18:50.600
But then I'm like,
yeah, I probably

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.590
have enough liquid nitrogen
burns on my figures

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.490
already that I don't want.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.850
Crystallographers
who use this a lot,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.030
they'll often be in
a situation where

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.780
you have this liquid
nitrogen. And it's

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.280
sort of dripping on you.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.440
But you have your crystal,
and if you let go,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.930
then you'll destroy
your crystal experiment.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.770
So you'll have liquid
nitrogen sitting in your palm.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.870
And you're like, OK,
I'm going to get a burn.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.400
Or I'm going to lose my crystal.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.410
And so you decide how
important that is.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.868
And so sometimes
a crystallographer

00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:22.010
will walk up to you
and go, see that scar?

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:27.130
That's 1.2 angstrom
data, baby, right there.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.990
So we suffer for our
science sometimes.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.630
So liquid nitrogen is
very-- changes the property.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.400
Cold things are different
than warm things.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.330
Buy a winter coat.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.830
So everything slows
down in the cold,

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.320
in terms of
elementary reactions.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.740
Our rate constants slow down.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.910
So now let's think
about a reaction

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.180
and what's called a
reaction coordinate

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.216
and consider what's
happening in a reaction.

00:19:57.216 --> 00:19:58.590
And then we're
going to come back

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.750
to thinking about the
effect of temperature,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.601
where temperature really
makes a difference.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.790
We'll quiet down a little.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.870
So considering the reaction
coordinate, reaction coordinate

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.190
the reactions of-- you bring
your reactants together

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.620
and form your product.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.450
So two things coming together
to form something else,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.410
that is a reaction.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.140
And as you go along
in the reaction,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.716
that's your reaction coordinate.

00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:29.090
And we're going
to also introduce

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:34.190
this term of activation
complex or transition state.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.020
So two molecules can collide.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.130
Two molecules
colliding, bimolecular.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.610
But every time those two
molecules come together,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.220
they're not necessarily
going to form a product.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.140
Why?

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.570
So only when that
collision energy is greater

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.570
than some critical energy--
which is sometimes called Emin,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.900
this sort of minimum energy
to get this reaction to go,

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.580
or as I like to call it,
the activation energy, Ea,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.240
that's what we've
been talking about,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.560
our activation energy--
will you get a reaction.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.390
So you need to have
enough energy in your two

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.310
things coming together.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.530
Those two things coming together
need to have a critical energy

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.431
for them to react.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.990
So why is this true?

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.900
You need to have
that critical energy.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.486
But why?

00:21:31.486 --> 00:21:34.420
Why is this necessary?

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.010
So it's necessary because before
this reaction takes place,

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:45.040
even if it's a very happy
reaction, things need to occur.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.290
So the two things coming
together need to often distort.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.170
Bonds might have to be broken.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.350
And new bonds need to be formed.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.030
And while that is occurring,
while there is distortion

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.340
of the bond or
bonds are breaking,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.850
you need to have some
potential energy to do that.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.710
You need some energy to
make that reaction go.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.980
So the potential
energy of the system

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.910
increases first while these
distortions are happening.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.620
So the encounter then
between them, you

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.600
form some activated
complex, or what's

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.430
known as a transition state.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:31.550
And that activated complex, it
can go on to form a molecule.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.690
Or from that activated
complex, the two molecules

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.310
may just go apart again.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.910
So what determines
whether they're

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.330
going to go on happily
to form their complex

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.400
or going to depart
from each other,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.850
never to form a larger molecule?

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.770
And the thing that
determines the fate

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.810
is that critical energy.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.050
So only those molecules
with that sufficient energy

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.000
to allow for those bond
distortions and rearrangements

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.820
will be able to go
on and make this.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.403
And you can think
about this, I think,

00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:07.770
in terms of a couple,
a relationship,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.380
that there's always some
work that has to go into it.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.310
It's never perfect.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.650
And if you put in this effort
and this work, you can go on.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.670
And if you don't really have
it in you and you're like, ah,

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.850
you walk away.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.350
You don't have that
critical energy.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.790
You don't have that special
overcome, that activation

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.284
energy, and you go back.

00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:27.450
So let's just take a look
at some molecules checking

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.180
each other out and
figuring out if they have

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.700
what it takes, if they
have that critical energy.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.330
Let's watch and
see what happens.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.280
Here they come.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.610
They're finding each other.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.890
They're circling each other.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.540
And oh my goodness.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.690
They had the critical
energy necessary.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.660
And they formed a
bigger yellow molecule.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.650
There they go.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.320
What a happy ending.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.260
So only those molecules that
have that critical energy

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.030
can go on and form
their complex.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.380
And so here is where
temperature comes into play.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.920
Here is where temperature
becomes really important.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.450
Because they need to have
a certain amount of energy.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.160
And there's a relationship
between the kinetic energy

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.330
of molecules and
their temperature.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.170
So let's take a look
at this plot over here.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.790
So this is, on one axis,
fraction of molecules.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.180
And on the other axis,
we have kinetic energy.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.340
So if you're at low
temperature over here,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.820
most of your molecules are going
to have a low kinetic energy.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.470
But it will tail off.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.140
And there will be some molecules
that will have a higher energy.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.240
And if this line here
represents that minimum energy,

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.490
that critical energy or that
activation energy, in blue

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.630
here we have those low
temperature molecules.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.700
Only a very small
fraction of those

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.360
will have the energy to react,
will be able to overcome

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.320
that minimum energy, that
critical energy needed.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.220
Now if you're at
high temperature,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.190
more molecules have a
higher kinetic energy.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:06.410
And if you see over here shaded
in orange, way more molecules

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.960
have that critical
energy, have the energy

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.060
necessary to distort those bonds
and go on to make a molecule.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.150
So here's where
temperature is important.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.112
So kinetic energy, pass it on.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.844
So let's draw some reaction
coordinates and think

00:25:24.844 --> 00:25:25.760
about what's going on.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.915
Yeah.

00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:28.740
AUDIENCE: For this
idea of collision,

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.386
could it also apply to
the association reactions?

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:33.362
Because that's
[INAUDIBLE] molecule.

00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:35.529
Or are [? they still into ?]
each other? [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:36.528
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:25:36.528 --> 00:25:38.680
So if you're talking
about the forward reaction

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.285
and the backward
reaction of things,

00:25:40.285 --> 00:25:42.410
whether it's two molecules
that are coming together

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.950
to form things or
molecules breaking apart,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.442
there's a critical
energy both directions.

00:25:48.442 --> 00:25:49.650
And we'll see that, actually.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.525
It's a good question.

00:25:50.525 --> 00:25:55.070
That kind of leads us in to our
reaction coordinate diagram.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.820
So most of this
is in your notes.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.820
There's a few
things that are not.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.060
But let's look at a
reaction coordinate diagram.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:08.470
And by that, I mean we have
Potential Energy, or PE,

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.390
on one side.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.640
And on the other
axis, we have what's

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.465
called just the
reaction coordinate.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.130
So if you're asked to draw a
reaction coordinate diagram

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.740
on a problem set or an exam,
asking for potential energy

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.370
versus reaction coordinate.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:35.640
Now our reactants are going
to have a particular amount

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.770
of potential energy.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.520
And in this case, it's up here.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:48.820
And our products are going
to have some potential energy

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.530
down here.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:01.750
And there will be a difference
in energy between these,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.590
our delta E. But these
reactants aren't just

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:11.200
going to be able to go to
products without overcoming

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.310
some kind of critical energy.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:19.490
So before they can go down
there, they need to go up here.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.790
So we have the
activation energy,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.840
f for forward direction.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.990
Also, if you're down
in products and you

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.067
want to go back to reactants,
there's also a barrier

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.150
that you have to overcome.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.550
And it's not just this.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.590
It's all the way up here.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.290
And so this would be
the activation energy

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.660
of the reverse reaction.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:52.060
And this dashed line on the
top is our transition state

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.160
or our activated complex.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.610
Both are two
expressions that are

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.830
used kind of interchangeably.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.755
So this transition states,
some kind of weird mixture

00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:06.630
where they've come
together, and they're sort

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.110
of breaking and distorting.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.170
It's not our final products.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.340
That's down here.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.870
But you need to go up in energy,
overcome an activation energy

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.670
barrier.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:21.640
So the transition here, you need
to go up, and then you go down.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.410
So now let's think about
all of these energy terms.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:32.570
And what's true is that the
change in energy-- this change

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.180
in energy between
reactants and products

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.190
is equal to our activation
energy for our forward reaction

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:47.010
minus the activation energy
of the reverse reaction.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.020
And this delta E over
here can be measured

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.230
from a calorimetry experiment.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.955
And you might
recall back when we

00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:58.010
were talking about
thermodynamics that E

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.380
is kind of closely
related to delta H.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.120
So we had this
equation at one point

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:16.660
that delta H is equal to
delta E plus the change in PV.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:22.290
And we said that for gases,
there's about a 1% to 2%

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.960
difference between
delta H and delta E.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.990
But for solids and liquids,
it's pretty much the same.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.380
So you can think
about this delta E

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.210
like you were thinking about
delta H, for the most part.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:40.000
So now for this, if we
have some of the numbers--

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.180
if you know activation energy
in the forward and the reverse,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.720
you can calculate
delta E. If you

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.370
know delta E and one of
the activation energies,

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.220
you can calculate the other.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.810
So I'll tell you for
this particular reaction

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.896
what these values are.

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:55.520
And I was going to
bring colored chalk,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.620
and somehow that didn't happen.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.100
So the activation energy in
this is not in your notes.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.640
So I'll write it down.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.640
Is 132 kilojoules per mole.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.320
And I'll also put it
here, a little bigger,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.140
132 kilojoules per mole.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:22.760
And for the reverse reaction,
it's 358 kilojoules per mole

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:28.660
and minus 358
kilojoules per mole.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.490
And so if we do
the math here, we

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:45.780
will calculate that delta E is
equal to minus 226 kilojoules

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.350
per mole.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.900
So would you expect that to be
an endothermic or exothermic

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.890
reaction?

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.770
Exothermic.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.400
Right.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.840
And we can put that
value also in here,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.750
minus 226 kilojoules per mole.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.870
So what's really important
here, even though it's

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.220
exothermic reaction,
it's not going

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.620
to just go without having
those molecules have

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.030
some critical energy
necessary to overcome

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.090
this activation energy barrier.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.170
You still need energy.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:26.460
You need to go up here
before you can go down there.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.800
So just sort of thinking
about this in layman's terms,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.740
this idea of these
activation energy barriers,

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:42.820
for me whenever I sit down to
write a grant or write a paper,

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.320
I think, wow.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.904
I sit down at my computer,
have my cup of coffee.

00:31:47.904 --> 00:31:50.070
I know that we're about to
get scooped on this data.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.830
So I really should write
this paper, a little stressed

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.340
about it.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.720
Then I think, wow.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.290
I could write a lot better
if my office was clean.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.750
Now I hate cleaning my office.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.470
But compared to writing a
paper, it's pretty good.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.540
I don't mind doing it.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.260
So then clean the office.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.950
Then walk the dog.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.180
Maybe do later some laundry.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.810
Lots of things happen.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.940
And then eventually, you
hear from the collaborators.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.830
They're like, I
need this paper now.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.010
And you're like, oh man.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:28.500
And so that stress gets you over
that activation energy barrier,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.970
just catapults you over.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.320
Or you wait to a grant--
you start six months early.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.100
And then the week
before it's due,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.500
suddenly you have that nervous
energy that gets you over that.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.520
So many of you have
probably experienced this.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.950
And you know, if you need some
extra help with an activation

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.490
energy barrier to do the rest
of those extra problems for exam

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.670
four, you can come talk to me.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.570
And I'll stress you out and get
you right over that activation

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.510
energy barrier.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.630
But the thing to keep in mind
is that look at this slope

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.270
in this case down here.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.800
So often it's just that little
something to get you over.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.090
And then it's smooth sailing.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.415
So you can work these
games with yourself.

00:33:15.415 --> 00:33:17.040
You've just got to
get over it and know

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.980
that once you're
over that barrier,

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.330
it's all going to be good.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.780
So you can get yourself over.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.150
You should never forget about
activation energy barriers.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.220
There's always a barrier.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.030
Am I right?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.940
There's always some
kind of barrier.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.180
Anything you're going
to do that's worthwhile

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.230
has some barrier
associated with it.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.240
So now let's think about the
results of these barriers,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.630
again, coming back to
this idea of temperature.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.000
So for an elementary
reaction-- again,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.210
that's a reaction that
occurs exactly as written.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.670
It's a step in an overall
reaction mechanism.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.555
There's always a barrier,
always a barrier.

00:33:54.555 --> 00:33:56.400
Barrier is always positive.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.550
It's always there.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.640
And so if you increase
the temperature,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.890
you're always going to increase
the rate of that reaction.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.100
It's always going to help
get over that barrier.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.400
But increase the temperature,
increase the rate.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.980
But for an overall
reaction, temperature

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.940
is a little more
complicated to predict.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.510
So if you increase
the temperature,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.529
it's not always as clear what's
going to happen to the rate.

00:34:26.529 --> 00:34:28.820
Because you can have a lot
of different steps involved.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.449
It can be exothermic
and endothermic.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.219
A lot can be happening.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:35.000
Changing the temperature,
you're changing k.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.190
So to think about
an overall reaction,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.326
we need to understand
reaction mechanisms.

00:34:40.326 --> 00:34:42.159
And that's really
convenient because we just

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.980
talked about reaction
mechanisms on Monday.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.250
So you all know how to write
out reaction mechanisms.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.430
So let's just practice.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.180
So for this example,
we have two molecules

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.775
of N O plus O2 going to 2NO2.

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:58.830
Step one, fast and reversible.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.320
N O plus N O, going
to an intermediate.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.840
Then the intermediate
is reacting

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.260
with oxygen going to two
molecules of our product.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.420
So we can write the
rate of formation

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.670
of product based
on the slow step,

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.420
or if we didn't
know the slow set,

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.370
on the second step
or the last step.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.360
So two molecules, again, two
molecules are being formed.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.960
k2 times the concentration
of the intermediate times

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.060
the concentration of O2.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.439
But we have an intermediate.

00:35:30.439 --> 00:35:32.480
So we need to solve for
the intermediate in terms

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.610
of rate constants,
reactants, and products.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.690
But now we're told we
have a fast step followed

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.800
by a slow step.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.390
So we know how to do this.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.100
And remember, when you have a
fast, reversible step followed

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:51.680
by a slow step, this first step
approximates an equilibrium

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.540
reaction.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.720
There is not much of the
intermediate that's being

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.187
siphoned off in the slow step.

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:58.145
So pretty much, when you
form the intermediate,

00:35:58.145 --> 00:36:00.330
it's going back and
forth just like you have

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.050
in an equilibrium situation.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.690
And just to emphasize this,
I'll share a little picture

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.890
here of the beach in
the summer when you

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.680
don't need your winter coat.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.440
And here we have my daughter
and her best friend.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.400
And they are trying
to empty the ocean

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.950
with this princess bucket.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.590
And one can ask the question, is
this going to affect the tides?

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.480
Is the ocean going
to be different?

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.790
But the rate at which
my daughter and Aiden

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.460
fill up their buckets
and bring them over here,

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.370
that's a really slow step
compared to everything

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.230
that's going on in the ocean.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.400
So when you have a very
slow step like a kid

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.050
and a long distance
with a princess pail,

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.070
you don't really need
to worry about that.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.230
And you can think about the fast
step as being an equilibrium.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.480
This is not being siphoned
off enough to worry about it.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.350
And so that makes it easier
to solve for your intermediate

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.470
because then you can just do it
by an equilibrium expression.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.160
So in the clicker question,
tell me how I can do that.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.210
AUDIENCE: I think you're good.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:15.850
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:16.742
10 more seconds.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.770
So let's just take
a look at that.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:41.070
So again, we're writing
our equilibrium expression

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:45.460
for the first step,
products over reactants.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.300
And then we can rearrange it to
solve because the product here

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.650
is our intermediate.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.800
So we can solve for the
intermediate in terms

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.490
of K1 and our reactant.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.500
And then we can
substitute it in.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.170
And that gives us this.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.020
So we had the 2k2 here.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.210
Now we have our K1
and our N O squared.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.160
And here we have
our oxygen there.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.220
So now we have a
rate law that doesn't

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.450
include any intermediates.

00:38:21.274 --> 00:38:23.190
I'm just going to put
that back up here if you

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.940
didn't get it written down.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.690
Now let's think of what
happens with temperature.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.300
So this is an elementary
rate constant, little k2.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.330
So you increase the rate when
you increase temperature.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.150
And here is our
expression again that

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.490
tells us about that change.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.920
So now for the
equilibrium constant,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.500
the effect of
temperature depends on

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.350
whether the reaction is
exothermic or endothermic.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:39:00.230
And does anyone remember
what the name of the equation

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.330
is that tells us about
temperature effect

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:06.360
with equilibrium constants?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.760
Yes.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.480
The van 't Hoff equation.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.820
I told you that some
time in the future I'd

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.640
ask you for the name
of this equation.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.446
And that time is now.

00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:16.820
You don't really
need to know it.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.570
But it's just fun.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:21.590
There's not many names for
equations in general chemistry.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.890
Look how similar
these equations are.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.920
These are very
similar equations.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.180
So we have the natural log
of rate constants here.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.230
Here we have the natural log
of equilibrium constants.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.060
Here we have our
activation energy.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.670
Here we have delta H.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:45.910
So if the reaction
is exothermic,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.800
if we increase the
temperature, what

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.620
happens to our
equilibrium constant?

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.842
Does it increase or decrease?

00:39:51.842 --> 00:39:54.940
You can just yell it out.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.740
It decreases.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:02.040
Now let's think about
what happens here.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.680
So our kobs now has an
elementary rate constant term,

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.040
which is going to
increase with temperature.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.840
And it has an equilibrium
constant term,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.120
which is going to
decrease with temperature

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.050
for an exothermic reaction.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.750
So we have these going
in opposite directions.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:27.500
So overall, we want to
think about the magnitude

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.220
of our activation energy
term for our rate constants.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.930
And we want to think about the
magnitude of our delta H term

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.880
in terms of the
equilibrium constants.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.140
So for the particular reaction
in question, you can look up.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.540
The activation energy
is a small number.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.570
And delta H, again,
it's exothermic.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.070
And it's a big number.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.690
So then if you're
thinking about that,

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.640
if Ea is small and positive--
Ea is always positive.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.980
There is always a
barrier, always positive.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.440
Then the rate constant is only
going to increase a little bit.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.590
But delta H is a
big negative number,

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:14.090
so the equilibrium constant
is going to decrease a lot.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.600
So for this particular reaction,
increasing the temperature

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.370
actually decreases the kobs.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:23.670
And so for any
reaction, it depends

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:27.430
on the magnitude of
Ea and the magnitude

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:33.070
and the sign of delta
H. So again, large Ea

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.600
means very sensitive
to temperature.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.700
Large delta H means that
the equilibrium constant is

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.930
very sensitive to temperature.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:45.860
For an elementary
rate constant, it's

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.430
always going to increase
with temperature.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.460
Because Ea is always positive.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.110
There is always a
barrier to overcome.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.170
Temperature always
increases a rate constant.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:00.400
But for an equilibrium
constant, it

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.060
can increase or decrease because
delta H isn't always positive.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.720
Like the activation
energy barrier,

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.990
it can be positive or negative.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.570
So the magnitude of delta
H, how big a number it is,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.630
tells you about the
magnitude of the change,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.080
how much the equilibrium
constant will change.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.630
Will k1 and k2 be
almost like each other

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.440
or really, really different from
each other, those equilibrium

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440
constants?

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.550
And the sign of delta H, whether
it's positive or negative,

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.400
tells you the direction
of the change.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.920
Will it increase or decrease?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.930
So I just want to
show where we're

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.860
going with this because
it's just super exciting.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.240
Yes.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.560
We're back to Le Chatelier.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.260
This is what I was
so excited about.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.510
Remember, Le Chatelier told
us, when we apply a stress

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.450
to the system, the system
responds in such a way

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.970
to minimize that stress.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:04.840
So if we increase
the temperature,

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.810
according to Le
Chatelier, what direction

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.566
will the reaction
shift, in the exothermic

00:43:10.566 --> 00:43:13.940
or the endothermic direction?

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.680
What is it?

00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:19.357
The endothermic.

00:43:19.357 --> 00:43:20.920
So you increase the temperature.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.950
You add heat.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.420
It shifts in a direction
to minimize that

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.270
or to use up that heat.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.680
So we'll end with one
last clicker question.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.710
And we'll finish this
concept on Monday.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:39.120
But we want to think about how
Le Chatelier and what we've

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.760
known already applies here.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.970
So why don't you tell me which
of these diagrams is exothermic

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.582
and which is endothermic?

00:43:48.582 --> 00:43:50.040
Because we're going
to tie this all

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.077
back to temperature
and Le Chatelier.

00:43:53.077 --> 00:43:54.660
AUDIENCE: We don't
have that question.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.618
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We
don't have that question.

00:43:56.618 --> 00:43:57.210
OK.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.652
Then we will not
do that question.

00:43:58.652 --> 00:44:00.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the question.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.026
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:04.290
So I'll just give you
the answer to that.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.450
And then we'll see
who the winners are.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.720
So that one is endothermic.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.430
And this one is exothermic.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.370
And we'll finish the
rest of this on Monday.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.336
But for now, can you tell
us who the winner is?

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.590
No, it's not coming up.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.573
AUDIENCE: It's Dan.

00:44:33.573 --> 00:44:34.698
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Top two.

00:44:34.698 --> 00:44:36.610
AUDIENCE: Dan and Jay.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.750
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Dan and Jay
have beat out the other folks.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.130
So we know who's
in the playoffs.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.230
All right.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.370
Friday exam.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.130
See you Monday in class
to finish the handout.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.070
All right.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:58.230
Let's take 10 more seconds
on the clicker question.

00:45:17.204 --> 00:45:20.060
So let's take a look at this.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.100
56% do you have
the right answer.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.610
So rate constants
always increase

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.835
with increase of temperature.

00:45:27.835 --> 00:45:30.450
That's our little k's.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.250
Because there is always
some activation energy

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.980
barrier to overcome.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.380
There is always a
positive barrier.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.100
Whereas, for equilibrium
constants, K,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.450
you can have a reaction that's
exothermic or endothermic.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.900
And so that will change.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.730
It either increases or
decreases because delta H

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:51.260
can be positive or negative.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.930
But activation energy
barriers are always positive.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.260
There's always a barrier.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.280
Always a barrier to doing
anything that's important.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.620
I've got to calm down.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:08.900
Le Chatelier tells me that
when a stress is applied

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.760
to the system, I should
respond in such a way

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.120
to minimize the stress.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.120
It's a very calming
rule in chemistry.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.680
Reactions don't like stress.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.140
And they'll respond in
a way to minimize it.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.320
So we've been talking
about Le Chatelier

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.910
for a lot of the semester.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:37.580
And we've talked about
the effect of temperature

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.610
on reactions previously.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.140
So if you add heat
to a reaction,

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.990
it will want to respond in
such a way to minimize the heat

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.780
or absorb the heat.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.222
So it shifts in the
endothermic direction.

00:46:53.222 --> 00:46:54.680
So we've already
talked about this.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.780
And nothing is new here today.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.640
But today, I'm going to
give you a different way

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.120
to rationalize why that happens.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.971
So we're not changing
what happens.

00:47:04.971 --> 00:47:06.720
We're just going to
come up with a new way

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.340
to rationalize the why.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.930
So we ended last time
with these two diagrams.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.500
And we identified one
as endothermic and one

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.190
as exothermic.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:23.020
So these, again, are our
reaction coordinate diagrams.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.580
We have PE on one side.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.050
What does PE stand for again?

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.030
Potential energy.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.530
It stands for other things too,
but in a reaction coordinate

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.470
diagram, that's what it is.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.630
And then the reaction
coordinate going this way.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.840
So we go from reactants to
products along the reaction

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.490
coordinate.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.430
So here in this
endothermic reaction,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.210
we have our reactants down
here, our products up here,

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.440
and a very large
activation energy barrier

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.260
for the forward direction, a
much smaller activation energy

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.540
barrier for the
reverse direction.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.580
With the exothermic
reaction here, we

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.910
have a smaller
activation energy barrier

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.230
for the forward direction
and a bigger one

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.130
for the reverse direction.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.930
So let's look at the
one equation that

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.170
will be on the exam that will
not be on your equation sheet.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.000
I think this is--
for this unit, this

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.210
is the one that will be
not on your equation sheet.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.000
This change in energy is
equal to the activation

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.740
energy for the
forward direction the

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.960
of reaction minus
the activation energy

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.150
for the reverse reaction.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.080
And again, this is
our delta E here.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.940
And this is our delta E here.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.210
Delta E is like delta H. If
you're talking about a gas,

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.920
it's 1% to 2% different.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.900
If you're talking about
a solid or a liquid,

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.760
it's negligibly different.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.020
So if we look at this
endothermic reaction here,

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.790
we have a big forward
activation energy

00:48:54.790 --> 00:49:00.270
barrier minus a small reverse
activation energy barrier.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.600
So that's going to give us a
positive value for delta E.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.720
And it'll be an
endothermic reaction.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.880
And if we look at this
equation again and fill it

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.220
in for the exothermic
reaction, we

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.790
have a small barrier in
the forward direction,

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.290
a big barrier in the
reverse direction,

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.190
and a negative value
for delta E and delta H.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:23.385
It's an exothermic reaction.

00:49:23.385 --> 00:49:25.010
Now let's think about
what happens when

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.260
we increase the temperature.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.210
So if we increase
temperature, it's

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:36.420
a lot easier to overcome this
forward activation energy

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.470
barrier, the big one.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.990
And that's going to
shift it to products.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.914
And this is because the small
activation energy barrier,

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.580
it's not that hard
to get over something

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.690
that's a small activation
energy barrier.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:48.670
It's not hard.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.820
But if it's a
really big barrier,

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.740
it's hard to get
over that barrier.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.580
You need a lot of
kinetic energy.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.700
Increasing the temperature
will give that kinetic energy

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.180
to overcome that barrier.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.590
Remember that when
molecules come together,

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.460
bonds are distorted and formed.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.460
The potential energy
goes up first.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.120
And only those molecules
with that critical energy

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.710
that can overcome that
activation energy barrier

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.100
can go on to products.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.410
Increase the temperature,
that allows you

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.210
to overcome the big barrier.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.407
Now if we look in this side,
this is a small barrier.

00:50:21.407 --> 00:50:22.990
They weren't really
having-- molecules

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.031
were probably not having
a huge amount of trouble

00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:25.890
with that barrier.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.070
The barrier that was hard was
for the reverse direction.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.590
So now you increase
the temperature

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.320
of an exothermic reaction.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.130
It's easier to overcome this big
barrier, the reverse barrier.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.800
And you have a shift
toward reactants.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.500
So this is what we
had seen before.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.380
You increase the temperature
of an endothermic reaction.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.290
You go to products.

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.780
You increase the temperature
of an exothermic reaction.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.330
It shifts to reactants.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.540
So these are the same
things we saw before.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.380
But now there's a new
rationalization behind it.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.620
Now we can think about this
in terms of activation energy

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.410
barriers.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:03.290
So the important
points to remember,

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:07.190
big activation energy
barrier, rate constant

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.170
very sensitive to temperature.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:14.710
If you have a big barrier,
increasing the temperature

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:17.120
makes a big difference.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.820
If you have a small
barrier, doesn't really

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.040
matter that much.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.280
Most of your molecules can
get over that small barrier.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.190
So big barrier, increasing
the temperature,

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.000
more molecules can go.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.230
And so you're going to
shift in the direction

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.460
of the big barrier.

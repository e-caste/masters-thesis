00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.970
Have you ever wondered why the word Ambulance
is printed as its mirror image on the front

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.039
an Ambulance truck? The word is written this
way so that drivers can read the word in their

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:18.710
rearview mirror signaling them to pull over
if necessary. In chemistry and biology, molecules

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.800
can also be mirror image of each other and
have very different functions.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.739
This video is part of the Structure-Function-Properties
video series. The structure, function and

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.739
properties of a system are related and depend
on the processes that define or create the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.859
system.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:46.629
Hi, my name is Brad Pentelute, and I am a
professor of chemistry at MIT. My research

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.449
focuses on the biological properties of mirror-image
proteins and how these macromolecules may

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.179
be used in pharmaceutical applications and
therapeutics.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.179
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with: Molecular Geometry, the structure

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.689
of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids,
as well as have an understanding of what a

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.729
protein is and its three-dimensional structure

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.700
After watching this video, you will be able
to:

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.549
Identify chiral objects and molecules
Understand how chirality plays a role in the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.549
function of biological compounds.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.469
Let's begin by talking about chirality. In
this video, you'll see that chirality is an

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.770
important feature in biological molecules
because molecular structure is often closely

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.780
related to biological function.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.780
A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable
with its mirror image. But, before we talk

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.060
about chirality in molecules, let's first
look at a couple of ordinary objects to learn

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.480
exactly what we mean by the term, chirality.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.390
Let's look at a common example of chirality
in this left and right glove. Gloves are mirror

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.510
images of one another. The gloves look identical
but we know from experience that they are

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.150
not the same. They have different shapes.
One fits only your left hand and the other

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.579
fits only your right hand. If we try to lay
the right glove on top of the left glove and

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.450
align their key features, we see that they
are not superimposable at all. Because left

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.980
and right gloves are non-superimposable mirror
images, we can say that gloves are chiral.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.480
Are there other objects that you can think
of that are chiral? Please pause the video

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.480
here to think of a few examples.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.319
You may have suggested such objects as your
left or right ears, a drinking fountain, or

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.900
a screw.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.180
Let's look at this airplane. Is it chiral?
If we take the airplane and compare it to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.640
its mirror image, we can see that the two
images are identical and are superimposable.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.180
Therefore, the airplane is not chiral. Can
you describe what characteristic of the airplane

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.180
makes it achiral? Please pause the video and
give a possible answer.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.900
There is a plane of symmetry through the center
of the airplane itself. If one half of an

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.150
object can be reflected onto its other half,
then the object is never chiral. Can you think

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.260
of another object with an internal plane of
symmetry? Please pause the video and try to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.260
think of other achiral objects and where the
internal plane of symmetry would be.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.630
Objects such as a chair, a drinking glass,
and a fork have an internal plane of symmetry

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.630
and hence are achiral. The planes of symmetry
are here, here, and here.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.850
Notice that there is no way to divide a right-handed
glove into two equal halves, which is why

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.690
the glove is chiral.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.690
Finally, another everyday object that I want
to show you is this fan. First, let's think.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.700
Do you think a fan is chiral? Please pause
the video and discuss this with a friend.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.860
Is the fan chiral? Yes, it is. Each blade
is hung with a tilt that makes the fan chiral!

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.510
The function of the tilted blades pushes air
forward to create a wind chill effect to cool

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.540
you. However, the tilted blades also cause
the fan to be non-superimposable with its

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.540
mirror image. As you can see, the mirror image
has blades that tilt in the opposite direction.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.670
All objects can be classified as chiral or
achiral, including molecules.

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.550
As with objects, a molecule is chiral if it
is non-superimposable with its mirror image.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.550
The mirror image of a chiral molecule is called
its enantiomer. Enantio is Greek for opposite

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.490
and the term enantiomer describes the relationship
between the two molecules.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.190
Enantiomers have identical molecular formulas
and have the same chemical connectivity but

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.880
differ in the three-dimensional spatial arrangement
of the atoms in the molecule.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.400
Let's look at this model of the molecule,
bromo-chloro-iodo methane. The green ball

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.770
represents a chlorine atom, the orange ball
represents a bromine atom, the purple ball

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.660
represents an iodine atom and the white ball
represents a hydrogen atom.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.870
If we take our molecule and hold it in front
of a mirror, we see the molecule and its image

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.810
in the mirror. But, now let's look at 3-D
models of both our original molecule and its

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.900
mirror image. We see that the two are not
superimposable, regardless of how one rotates

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.900
the molecules. Hence, this tells us that bromo-chloro-iodo
methane is a chiral molecule.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.440
A quick way to know if a molecule is chiral
is to check and see if it has a chiral center.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.910
A chiral center is a tetrahedral atom attached
to four different atoms or groups. The tetrahedral

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.040
atom is usually carbon.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.690
Let's make a model of the organic compound,
2-chlorobutane. The number 2 in front of the

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.060
compound name means that chlorine is on the
second carbon atom. This carbon is attached

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:24.030
to four different groups, chlorine, hydrogen,
a -CH3 group and a -CH2CH3 group and that

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.770
means that it's a chiral center.
What would happen to the chirality of this

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.990
compound if we substituted the hydrogen atom
with a second chlorine atom? Would the resulting

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.990
molecule be chiral? Please pause the video
here.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.360
This new molecule, called 2, 2 di-chlorobutane
is not chiral. The second carbon with two

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.080
chlorine atoms no longer has four different
groups attached. You can even see that this

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.630
molecule has an internal plane of symmetry
and therefore can be superimposable on its

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.630
mirror image.
When we do have a chiral molecule, sometimes

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:16.850
its enantiomer has an entirely different function.
For example, the enantiomers of Carvone are

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.300
the flavors of caraway and spearmint. One
enantiomer of Carvone fits into a specific

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.890
receptor in your nose only in the way a left-handed
glove fits your left hand. The other enantiomer

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.570
of carvone fits into an entirely different
receptor, resulting in the different odor.Many

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.890
drugs such as the pain reliever, ibuprofen
has biological activity while its enantiomer

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.659
As with simple molecules, it is possible for
proteins to exist that are mirror images of

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:44.660
each other. However, this doesn't occur in
nature. Naturally occurring proteins are composed

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:51.660
of L-amino acids only. It is not clear why
nature selected for this particular enantiomer.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.060
Selection of L-amino acids has structural
consequences for a proteins three-dimensional

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.490
shape.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.240
Pause the video here and discuss with a friend
the general structure of amino acids. What

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.240
are the groups attached to the central carbon?
Which if any of the amino acids are achiral?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.890
An amino acid contains both an amino group
and a carboxylic acid group. It also contains

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:24.890
a hydrogen atom and a sidechain. The central
atom is carbon. Of the 20 naturally occurring

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:31.940
amino acids, glycine is the only achiral amino
acid. Its sidechain is a second hydrogen atom.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.720
The remaining 19 amino acids have the L configuration.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.350
Let us recall that naturally occurring amino
acids have an L-configuration and combine

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:49.000
to form L-proteins. However, scientists can
now chemically synthesize proteins made up

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.090
entirely of D-amino acids. These synthetic
macromolecules are also known as D-proteins.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.960
Interestingly, these proteins fold into three-
dimensional structures, which mirror those

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.960
of the naturally occurring L-protein counter-part.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.000
Snow fleas are a species of dark blue insect.
They are often seen bouncing around on the

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.860
snow in the winter. Ice fish live in the Antarctic.
These fish live in the ocean at subzero temperatures.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:26.940
What do the snow flea and the arctic fish
have in common? They can both survive in subfreezing

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.840
temperatures. How do they do this? Both creatures
make a class of proteins called Antifreeze

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:39.570
proteins. These proteins protect these organisms
and others, including moths, beetles, plants

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:44.930
and even bacteria by binding to water and
stopping the growth of ice crystals in their

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.340
bodies.
Is water chiral? Please pause the video here

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:56.340
and try to answer this question.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.000
Here you can see the chemical structure of
water. As you can see, it has two planes of

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
symmetry, and water is superimposable with
its own mirror image.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:16.230
The antifreeze protein is comprised of 81
amino acids folded into six helices. Each

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:22.290
helix is connected by amino acids that form
a short connecting loop. The helices in the

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.830
antifreeze protein are left-handed. Do you
think the helices are chiral? Pause the video

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:34.830
and discuss this with a friend.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.460
The helix winds up in the direction of your
left thumb when your fingers are curled in

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:46.360
to make a fist. These helices do not have
an internal plane of symmetry, and are not

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.290
superimposable with their mirror images. They
are chiral.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:58.290
The antifreeze protein was the first protein
whose mirror image was chemically synthesized.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:04.930
The mirror image protein is composed of entirely
D-amino acids. The helices are right-handed,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.870
opposite to that of the naturally occurring
protein. They wind up in the direction of

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:16.460
your right thumb when your fingers are curled
in to make a fist. In proteins, we see chirality

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.300
in the amino acid units and in the secondary
structure as well.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.420
Do you think the D-form of the antifreeze
protein will have a function the same as or

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.420
different from the natural L-form? Please
pause the video here and discuss with a friend.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.920
Interestingly, the mirror image protein has
the same antifreeze properties. This is because

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:51.060
its binding partner, water is achiral. So
the mirror image protein can still bind water.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.240
Hopefully by now you have the tools to recognize
chiral objects and molecules, and the role

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.610
that chirality can play in recognition and
specificity between biological systems. In

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.590
this video, we saw that an object or molecule
is chiral if it cannot be superimposed onto

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:18.190
its mirror image. Objects or molecules that
have an internal plane of symmetry are never

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.750
chiral. We also talked about enantiomers,
which are the mirror image of a chiral molecule.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.620
Since the spatial orientation of the atoms
in enantiomers are different, chiral compounds

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.430
can and often do have distinct functions.
But, as you saw with the antifreeze protein,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.710
sometimes there are exceptions to the rule!

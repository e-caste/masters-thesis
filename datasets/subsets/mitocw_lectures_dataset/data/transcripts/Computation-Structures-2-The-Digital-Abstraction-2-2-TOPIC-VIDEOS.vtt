00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.790
In the previous
chapter, we discussed

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.000
how to encode information
as sequences of bits.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.090
In this chapter, we
turn our attention

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.380
to finding a useful
physical representation

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.410
for bits, our first
step in building devices

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.890
that can process information.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.680
So, what makes a
good bit, i.e., what

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.920
properties do we want our
physical representation of bits

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.250
to have?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.370
Well, we’ll want a lot of them.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.280
We expect to carry
billions of bits

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.060
around with us,
e.g., music files.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.070
And we expect to have access
to trillions of additional bits

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.470
on the web for
news, entertainment,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.450
social interactions, commerce
— the list goes on and on.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
So we want bits to be
small and inexpensive.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.200
Mother Nature has a suggestion:
the chemical encoding embodied

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.910
in DNA, where sequences of the
nucleotides Adenine, Thymine,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.430
Guanine and Cytosine
form codons that

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.530
encode genetic
information that serve

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.490
as the blueprint for
living organisms.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.020
The molecular scale meets our
size requirements and there’s

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.150
active research underway on how
to use the chemistry of life

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.520
to perform interesting
computations on a massive

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100
scale.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.970
We’d certainly like our bits
to be stable over long periods

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.510
of time — “once
a 0, always a 0!”

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.580
The Rosetta Stone, shown here
as part of its original tablet

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.170
containing a decree from
the Egyptian King Ptolemy V,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
was created in 196 BC and
encoded the information needed

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.660
for archeologists
to start reliably

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.620
deciphering Egyptian
hieroglyphics almost 2000

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.230
years later.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.200
But, the very property
that makes stone engravings

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.280
a stable representation
of information

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.000
makes it difficult to
manipulate the information.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.030
Which brings us to the final
item on our shopping list:

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.130
we’d like our representation of
bits to make it easy to quickly

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.590
access, transform,
combine, transmit and store

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.040
the information they encode.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.910
Assuming we don’t want to carry
around buckets of gooey DNA

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.870
or stone chisels, how
should we represent bits?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.330
With some engineering we
can represent information

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.729
using the electrical
phenomenon associated

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.740
with charged particles.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.230
The presence of
charged particles

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.060
creates differences in
electrical potential energy

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
we can measure as voltages, and
the flow of charged particles

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.450
can be measured as currents.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.730
We can also encode information
using the phase and frequency

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.070
of electromagnetic fields
associated with charged

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.360
particles — these latter
two choices form the basis

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.570
for wireless communication.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.055
Which electrical phenomenon
is the best choice

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.555
depends on the
intended application.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.150
In this course, we’ll use
voltages to represent bits.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.200
For example, we might choose
0V to represent a 0-bit and 1V

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.340
to represent a 1-bit.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.130
To represent
sequences of bits we

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.190
can use multiple
voltage measurements,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.100
either from many
different wires,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.640
or as a sequence of voltages
over time on a single wire.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.810
A representation using
voltages has many advantages:

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.610
electrical outlets provide an
inexpensive and mostly reliable

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.860
source of electricity and,
for mobile applications,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.320
we can use batteries
to supply what we need.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.390
For more than a century, we’ve
been accumulating considerable

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.280
engineering knowledge about
voltages and currents.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.220
We now know how to build very
small circuits to store, detect

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.100
and manipulate voltages.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.990
And we can make those circuits
run on a very small amount

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.950
of electrical power.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.820
In fact, we can
design circuits that

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.410
require close to zero power
dissipation in a steady state

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.520
if none of the encoded
information is changing.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.560
However, a voltage-based
representation

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.290
does have some challenges:

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.750
voltages are easily affected by
changing electromagnetic fields

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900
in the surrounding environment.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.340
If I want to transmit
voltage-encoded information

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.810
to you, we need to be
connected by a wire.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.420
And changing the
voltage on a wire

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.870
takes some time since the
timing of the necessary flow

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.360
of charged particles is
determined by the resistance

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.850
and capacitance of the wire.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.160
In modern integrated circuits,
these RC time constants

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.550
are small, but sadly not zero.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.190
We have good engineering
solutions for these challenges,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.270
so let’s get started!

MATTHEW VANDER
HEIDEN: OK, hello.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.880
So last time, we discussed
the pentose phosphate pathway,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.390
which can serve as this
shunt from glycolysis

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.850
where glucose can be converted
to five-carbon ribulose

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:37.010
1, 5-bisphosphate
generating NADPH and ribose.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.950
And this shunt
from glycolysis can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.290
work with the non-oxidative
pathway, where

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.480
those five-carbon
units can then be

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.920
used by the non-oxidative
pathway to re-enter glycolysis,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.210
giving cells and ability
to generate NADPH.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.310
Now, we described that this
non-oxidative pathway can also

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.360
operate in the
reverse direction,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240
such that cells can take
products of glycolysis

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.510
and instead use them to
generate ribose for nucleotides

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.120
and avoid the
production of NADPH,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.460
really giving cells
the flexibility

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.260
to either make NADPH
when they need it,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.280
make ribose when they
need it, with the ability

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.980
to either operate in
this direction as a shunt

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.430
and allow NADPH to be produced
and material to re-enter

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.890
glycolysis for
further oxidation,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580
or to just generate ribose
if they have enough NADPH

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.630
and they simply need that
for nucleotide synthesis.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.250
And we've spent
some time discussing

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.690
that NADPH is a key
molecule that allows cells

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.020
to do reductive reactions.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.090
This includes the biosynthesis
of reduced carbon, which

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.460
is, of course, the
way that nature

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.050
stores energy for later use.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.470
We saw this used as a
way to make reduce carbon

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.170
as carbohydrates
and photosynthesis.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.210
And of course, it
can also be used

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.030
to generate fatty acids,
which is the most reduced

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.970
form of carbon that
all organisms can

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.640
have to store energy for later.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.030
And the topic of today is
really to go through the pathway

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.920
that all organisms use to
produce those fatty acids

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.980
and lipids as a way to
store this energy as reduced

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.760
carbon for later.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240
Now, you'll notice
I drew up there,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.200
as an introduction for the
reminder of what we talked

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.310
about last time with the
pentose phosphate pathways,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.890
really layering
it on top of many

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.850
of the other pathways in
central carbon metabolism

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.920
that we've already discussed.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.220
And I drew it that way because
I want to show that you already

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.505
know quite a bit.

00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:56.130
If you think back to
the very beginning

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.700
where we had this complex
metabolic pathway chart, well,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.800
we've already been able to build
quite a complex network of how

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.020
metabolism works.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.510
And really, at this point,
you know the basics.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.890
So today's lectures and the
three lectures after it,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.843
so the four remaining lectures
that we have in this course,

00:03:15.843 --> 00:03:17.760
we're going to cover an
awful lot of material.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.210
Because, of course, we
have to discuss how all

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.480
of the remaining classes
of biomolecules-- lipids,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.460
nucleic acids, proteins--

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.600
link into the rest
of metabolism,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.270
which is an awful lot to cover.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.170
But what you will see is
that, in understanding

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.830
the basics and the complexity
of what we've already described,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.410
you actually know
already most of what

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.620
you need to know to understand
these remaining pathways.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.710
That is nature continues to
repurpose the same relatively

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.660
simple reactions over and over
and over again to really build

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.230
this complex network that
is metabolism, including

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.290
this diversity of
macromolecules.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.110
Now, of course, there's
a few bits of chemistry

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.970
that we still have to discuss.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.000
We haven't discussed much in
terms of nitrogen metabolism.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.970
But most of what you
need to know you've

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.339
already covered in understanding
glycolysis, the TCA cycle,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.190
pentose phosphate
pathway, et cetera.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.390
OK.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.740
So now onto the
topic of the day,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.830
which is really lipids
and fatty acid synthesis.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.980
And so, again, I want to
reiterate that organisms

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.290
store energy as reduced carbon.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.130
Fat is the most reduced
form of carbon to store.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.840
And so if we're going
to generate fat,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.250
we need a source of electrons.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.930
Because if we're going
to reduce carbon,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.580
something else has
to be oxidized.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.500
That is those electrons
have to come from somewhere.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.800
And as hopefully
as clear to you,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.440
those electrons
will come from NADPH

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240
because it forms this useful
electron donor for cells.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.880
Now, it should also hopefully
be clear at this point

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.670
that, if oxidation
of carbon releases

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.700
energy, reduction of
carbon, therefore,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.260
it needs energy input.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.810
And so we're also going
to need a bunch of ATP

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.740
if we're going to make fat.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.380
And so ADP and NADPH are
really the energetic drivers

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.650
of how we're going to
take more oxidized carbon

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.630
and reduce it to
build fatty acids.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.590
Now, all organisms use
similar pathways to do this.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.480
But, of course, the sources
of where the NADPH the

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.080
ATP come from can be different
depending on the organism.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.740
And so we described
photosynthesis

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.250
is this process used by
photosynthetic organisms, where

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.490
they can use the light
reactions of photosynthesis

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.830
to make both ATP and NADPH.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.100
And we described how
that ATP and NADPH

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.510
could be used to drive
synthesis of glucose

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.470
or other carbohydrates.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.620
And effectively,
you can also imagine

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.160
that that same ATP and NADPH
from the light reactions

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.600
could also be used to
form the electron donors

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.640
and the ATP needed to
synthesize fats and lipids.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.560
But of course, as
animals, we also

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.290
know that, if we eat too
much, we also have the ability

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.410
to store excess energy as fat.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.600
And, therefore, we must also
have sources of NADPH and ATP

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.670
that we can use that
are non-photosynthetic.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.770
And those, of course,
are the reactions

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.260
that we've already talked about
with glycolysis and the TCA

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.210
cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation as a way

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.930
to make ATP, as well
as NADPH from reactions

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.150
like the oxidative
pentose phosphate

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.300
pathway as a source of NADPH.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:58.690
Now, eukaryotes will make
fatty acids in the cytosol.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.280
And if you think
about why that is,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.610
it's because mitochondria,
remember, is where

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.190
we did fatty acid oxidation.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.490
And so fatty acid oxidation
is breaking down fatty acids.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.310
Fatty acid synthesis--
building fatty acids.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.150
One set of reactions is
in the cytosol, synthesis.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.240
One set is in the mitochondria,
breakdown, makes sense.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.120
Remember, compartmentalized
metabolism

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.120
gives you this ability to
favor different pathways.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.460
Mitochondria is better
at oxidative reactions.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.190
Cytosol is going to be better
at reductive reactions.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.670
And also, this
compartmentalization

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.150
will keep catabolism and
anabolism separate, so another

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.390
example of a point that we've
been making over and over again

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.530
throughout this course.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.350
Now, if we look up
here at our diagram,

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.620
we're going to make fatty acids
from two carbon acetyl-CoA

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.120
units, OK?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.570
And so, remember, when we
broke down fatty acids,

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.790
most fatty acids
were even in number.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.510
That's allowed us to break them
down into acetyl-CoA units.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.570
Well, we're also going to build
them with two carbon acetyl-CoA

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.240
units.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.790
And so this also contributes to
why most fatty acids in nature

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.820
have even numbers of carbons.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.790
Now, you'll also recall
from our past lectures

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.390
that fatty acids are often
esterified to alcohols.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.030
Those can be things
such as glycerol

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.700
based alcohols, which
allow us to form lipids,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.820
either triacylglyerides, those
neutral lipids for energy

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.990
storage, or phospholipids
to form membranes.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.620
And that, of course,
comes from a branch of--

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.640
glycerol, of course, comes from
dihydroxyacetone phosphate,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.750
a molecule in glycolysis.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.688
Now, of course, I'm not
going to draw acetyl-CoA now.

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:03.480
I'll draw it later.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.230
But remember, it is not reduced.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.760
And so that's where we're going
to need the electrons, NADPH

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.390
as well as ATP for the
energetic requirements

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.640
in order to take those
two carbon units,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.460
build the acyl chain,
and ultimate reduce

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.560
them to make fat.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.720
Now, when we do
this, you're going

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.450
to see that carbon dioxide,
as well as biotin--

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.690
OK, so you might be thinking,
oh, what's biotin used for?

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.830
It's a carboxylation reaction.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.620
And so CO2 in a carboxylation
reaction involving biotin

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:47.080
is going to be required
for fatty acid synthesis.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.600
However, you will also see
that that CO2 carbon is not

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.320
incorporated into
the fatty acyl chain.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:05.330
And so you'll see that the CO2
is required, but ultimately

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.960
is added and released,
which is exactly

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.310
the same analogy to what we saw
when we did gluconeogenesis.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.460
Remember, the pyruvate
carboxylase PEPCK reaction

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.560
in gluconeogenesis,
if you look back,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.350
a CO2 was added to pyruvate
to make oxaloacetate and then

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.830
release later to generate PEP.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.430
That helped drive the energetics
of that reaction, no net CO2

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.800
incorporation,
very similar thing

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.520
happening in fatty
acid synthesis.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:55.210
Now, in animals, mammals,
much of fatty acid synthesis

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:07.600
is catalyzed by a giant single
polypeptide enzyme called

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.300
FASN or Fatty Acid
Synthase Complex,

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.660
which is, unlike
other complexes we

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.180
talked about where you might
have different polypeptide

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.820
subunits coming together
to form a complex,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.420
this is one gigantic
polypeptide that

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.840
is able to catalyze many
of the enzymatic steps

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.270
of fatty acid synthesis.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.940
Now, a bit of
trivia is that this

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:36.780
is different from plants
and bacteria, which

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.720
will carry out the exact
same enzymatic reactions.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.510
However, it, rather
than using a giant fatty

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.370
acid synthase
complex, will have all

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.470
the different
enzymatic activities

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.540
broken up and catalyzed by
different proteins, separately

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.950
encoded polypeptides.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:06.900
Now, all organisms will do
this using a protein called

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:14.140
acyl carrier protein.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.800
And so acyl carrier
protein, you'll see,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.610
is really analogous
to acetyl-CoA.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.220
So it's a way to
add a thioester,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.720
mark a separate pool, and will
carry the growing fatty acyl

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.840
chain as we synthesize it, OK?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:42.880
So acyl carrier protein is part
of FASN, the big polypeptide

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.700
FASN in mammals that
catalyze this thing.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.560
The acyl carrier
protein is not separate.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.970
It's actually built in
to the sequence of FASN,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.150
whereas acyl carrier protein
in plants and bacteria

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:04.720
is a small 9 kilodalton
protein, all right?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.240
So in mammals, acyl
carrier protein-- part

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.820
of the fatty acids
synthase polypeptide

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.350
in plants and bacteria.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.520
Acyl carrier protein is a
small 9 kilodalton protein.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.820
And so what acyl
carrier protein looks

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.740
like is that as, part of
this 9 kilodalton protein

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:31.060
or sequence within FASN,
there is a serine residue.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.810
Remember, serine has an
alcohol on its side chain.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:40.270
And that alcohol on its side
chain has a phosphodiester bond

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.280
to a phosphopantothenate
group just

00:13:45.280 --> 00:14:03.930
like we saw with coenzyme A.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.000
So if you look
back in your notes

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.770
when I drew out coenzyme A, the
business end of the molecule

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:16.020
was right here with
the sulfur on the end

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.800
there being the one that
form the phosphodiester bond.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.330
This one, rather than being
linked to a nucleotide,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.410
in this case is linked to a
serine as part of a peptide.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.910
And so this is why it's
very, very similar.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:43.910
So this here is same as end
of coenzyme A. And so really

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.720
you can think of ACP,
Acyl Carrier Protein,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.280
and coenzyme A, in some
ways analogous to how

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.100
we talked about NAD and NADPH--

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.050
same functionality,
in this case,

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:03.800
providing a sulfur to make
these thioester bonds as a way

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.620
to activate the acid on
the end of the fatty acid.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.730
One used for synthesis,
one use for breakdown--

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.720
acyl carrier protein
used for synthesis.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:21.290
Coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA is used
for oxidation, whereas in,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.640
remember, NAD in NADP, one
was used to create an NAD,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.750
NADH ratio that favored
oxidative reactions, the other

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.680
used to create an NADP,
NADPH ratio that favored

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.100
reductive reactions even
though the functionality

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.090
of the electron donor, in
the case of NAD and NADP

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.880
or, in this case, the carrier
function with the thioester

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:56.630
bond in ACP and coenzyme
A are analogous,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.480
really allows you to mark
different pools to carry out,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.890
in this case, anabolic and
catabolic reactions in cells.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.140
So often, we will abbreviate
this just as we abbreviate CoA

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.830
as sort of CoASH or SCoA.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.030
In this case, we're
going to use ACPSH

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.570
as an abbreviation for
Acyl Carrier Protein.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.930
However, remember, just
like coenzyme A was

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.270
this giant molecule, it kind
of is a little misleading

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.440
to write it this way.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.800
Acyl carrier protein is an even
bigger molecule, a 9 kilodalton

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.870
peptide in plants and bacteria.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.020
And so, again, misleading
to write it this way

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.890
because it's really this
giant group linked to

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.270
and carrying the acyl chain.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:44.770
OK.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.750
Now, the first step in
fatty acid synthesis

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.830
is carboxylation of acetyl-CoA.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.890
This is a very important
step of the process.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.820
And it is not catalyzed
by the fatty acid synthase

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.770
complex, the fatty acid
synthase protein in mammals.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.460
And so, in all organisms,
it is catalyzed

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.390
by a separate enzyme
abbreviated ACC, which stands

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.890
for Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.400
So ACC is a pretty
famous enzyme.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.000
It's argued by many to
be the rate limiting

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.785
step in fatty acid synthesis.

00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:36.160
And it makes sense
because you're

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.170
going to see this as we're
doing a carboxylation

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.500
reaction, big energetics here.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.110
And that is, obviously,
as we learned

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.970
before, the steps
that you regulate

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:51.350
are the ones with the biggest
change in free energy.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:18:00.400
So here's our old
friend, acetyl-CoA.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.500
And what ACC carries out
is it carries out the

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.420
as biotin found in the
active site, which,

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.600
of course, can contain a CO2.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.230
Just as a quick reminder,
how do we put CO2 on biotin

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.550
for carboxylic reactions?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:30.490
And so, remember, CO2 is in
equilibrium with bicarbonate.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:38.170
That bicarbonate can be
phosphorylated by ATP

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:51.230
to give this phosphobicarbonate.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.630
And then that phosphate
can be released

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:05.450
to add the CO2 onto the active
biotin part of the enzyme.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.210
That then carries
that CO2 and can

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.400
be used to transfer
the CO2 to carboxylate,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:26.240
in this example,
acetyl-CoA to generate

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.530
this carboxylated acetyl-CoA
three-carbon molecule, which

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.550
is referred to as
malonyl CoA, all right?

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.000
So this is exactly
the same mechanism

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.720
that we described before
for pyruvate carboxylase

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.510
in gluconeogenesis, all right.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.040
So I drew a part of it here.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:56.840
Remember, if we draw
acetyl-CoA, in the enol form

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.000
of the molecule--

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.560
here we have our biotin, CO2.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:14.370
If you look back at your notes,
we drew a mechanism like that.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.330
And that allowed us
to, in that case,

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.270
take pyruvate and turn
it into oxaloacetate

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.970
and gluconeogenesis by
pyruvate carboxylase.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.970
In this case--
identical reaction,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.040
but this time you're
carboxylating acetyl-CoA

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.890
to make malonyl-CoA, right?

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.310
And it's malonyl-CoA
that ends up

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.510
being the substrate for
fatty acid synthase,

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.820
either the single fatty acid
synthase protein in mammals

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.070
or the same sets of
individually encoded activities

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.120
on different polypeptide
in plants and bacteria.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.510
All right, so let's
draw this out.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.290
So here's fatty acid synthase.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.040
And so fatty acid
synthase has on it

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.640
two different acyl
carrier protein sites,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.070
so two different
acyl carrier protein

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.360
encoded within the fatty acid
synthase polypeptide, each

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.290
of which have attached to them
this phosphopantothenate group

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.450
to make it an acyl
carrier protein.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.760
Or there would be two
separate acyl carrier proteins

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.550
in plants and bacteria as
part of the complex that

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.740
synthesizes fatty acids.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:37.020
And each of them can
pick up a acyl-CoA.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:47.130
So here's a malonyl-CoA
and an acetyl-CoA.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:54.030
Each of those can basically,
onto the acyl carrier protein,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.750
exchange the thioester
bond with the CoA

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.835
to be a thioester bond with
the acyl carrier protein.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.640
And so to get this
started, on one site

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.190
you'll end up going an
acetyl-CoA, exchange

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.070
the thioester bond, such
that you release the CoA.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.010
And now, you have an acetyl ACP.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.240
And on the other side--

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.300
a malonyl-CoA exchange
that thioester bond

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.530
releasing the CoA.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.130
So you have a malonyl
ACP, all right?

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.030
So what does that look like?

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.895
Well, it'll look like this.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.660
OK, so here we're going
to have basically--

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.740
I'll give you some color, so
you can see what's going on.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.940
But here you have, on an
upper acyl carrier protein

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.230
site, the malonyl
group, so malonyl ACP.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:52.800
And on this lower site, I
put on an acetyl ACP, OK?

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.980
So what happens
is you now release

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:07.970
the CO2 that was added by
acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.720
And that allows forming
carbon bond from here to here,

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:22.930
releasing the ACP
on the lower site

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:54.340
and generating this
longer four-carbon chain

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:02.410
on the upper acyl
carrier protein site.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.670
OK.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:09.475
Once you have this, now,
four-carbon chain, obviously,

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:11.140
if we're going to
make a fatty acid,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.480
we have to reduce this carbon.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.900
And so that's
exactly what happens.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.560
And so how do we reduce it?

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.350
We've now seen this
many, many times.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:28.180
And so if we use NADPH
as an electron donor,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:37.960
oxidizing it to NADP+, that
generates this hydride ion

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.070
to electron carrier.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:26:11.650
And now, we net reduce this
ketone to this alcohol, OK?

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.400
Next step is we're
going to remove water

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.200
across that bond,
just a dehydration.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.940
All right.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:04.750
Now, we can further reduce
that carbon-carbon bond.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:11.620
The electrons, again, come
from NADPH as it's oxidized

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.210
to NADP+.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:41.330
And that leaves us with a
reduced four-carbon fatty

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.210
acid, a four zero
fatty acid here

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:50.150
on this, esterified
by this thioester

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:56.570
to ACP, on the upper site
of fatty acid synthase.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.890
OK.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.680
All right, so what happens next?

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.400
Well, we can repeat this cycle.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:13.790
So, now, we can have basically
this S-ACP on the lower site

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:33.030
pick up a malonyl-CoA,
release the CoA.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:39.140
And then we have, down
here, another malonyl-CoA.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:11.590
Now, they're esterified to
the ACP on the lower side.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:17.510
All right, now, we can run this
exact same series of reactions

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.010
again.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.060
OK.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:57.970
That releases CO2, also releases
a free S-ACP on the upper site.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.675
And now, we are left with this.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.600
This now-- six-carbon
molecule with a thioester

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.160
now on the ACP on
the lower side.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.020
Hopefully, you're
getting the point.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:56.090
I can now take this through
the same cycles I took before.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.030
But first, we're
going to use NADPH

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:06.590
to reduce this ketone to the
alcohol, the dehydration,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:13.980
use NADPH again to reduce the
carbon-carbon double bond.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:44.760
And we are left with now
this S-APP on the lower site.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:52.455
I can now run this
cycle five times.

00:31:52.455 --> 00:31:56.620
We'll add another malonyl-CoA,
this time to the upper site,

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.400
combine them.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.310
Now, you have this growing
chain on the upper site,

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.340
reduction, another
malonyl-CoA to the lower site,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.480
blah, blah, blah.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.710
Run it five times.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:14.540
Eventually, I'm going to end up
with a 16, 0, fatty acyl ACP.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:23.550
And then I can take that,
exchange it back for a CoA.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:31.320
And I end up with a 16
carbon fatty acyl-CoA

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:38.230
or palmitoyl-CoA CoA molecule,
such that all of the carbons

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:43.330
added came from
acetyl-CoA except for one.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.720
All of that acetyl-CoA
was added by, first,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.110
adding a CO2 via
acetyl-CoA carboxylase,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.340
generating a malonyl-CoA
that's spending ATP

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.990
to put the carboxyl group on.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.120
Because, of course, we
need it to spend an ATP

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.070
in the acetyl-CoA reaction.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:05.290
And so seven cycles
were needed to generate

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.870
this 16, 0 fatty acyl-CoA.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:13.090
And so those seven cycles
were seven ATP molecules.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:19.690
I also needed 2 times 7,
or 14, NADPH molecules.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.530
And that allowed me to
run this cycle 17 times

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.360
and make a fully reduced
16-carbon fatty acid.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.880
Now, it turns out that
all of this activity

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.220
stops on the fatty acid
synthase molecule when it gets

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.010
to a 16-carbon palmitoyl-CoA.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.020
But of course, as
we described before,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:53.900
organisms have longer fatty
acids than 16 carbons.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:04.360
And so 18-carbon and
longer fatty acids

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:10.000
are made in exactly the same
chemistry, same reactions

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.650
that we just described.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.020
The only difference
is that they are not

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.570
made on the fatty
acid synthase complex.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.699
So they're made in a
different location.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:25.280
And so they're made
at the ER membrane

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.760
in eukaryotes, all right,
so the ER in eukaryotes.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.330
Even though the
enzymes themselves

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:42.080
carry out the same reaction,
the enzymes that carry out this

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:52.350
are encoded by
different polypeptides,

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.949
so-called fatty acid
elongase enzymes.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.660
Although the chemistry
is exactly what

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.300
we already described.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:04.620
But those enzymes
act on the thioester

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:12.510
with the CoA, not the thioester
with the acyl carrier protein.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.140
But it's still the same.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.950
There's still one
ATP per acetylcholine

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.502
for two carbon unit
added because that

00:35:23.502 --> 00:35:24.960
is needed to
carboxylate it to make

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.770
the malonyl-CoA because that's
what's driving the addition

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:37.150
and two NADPHs per
two-carbon unit

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:43.600
added to carry out the
reduction to take that carbonyl

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.300
from the acetyl CoA or
the malonyl-CoA that's

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.100
added as a two-carbon unit and
reduce it to the fully reduced

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.610
carbon.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.720
OK.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.650
And so that is how you
make saturated fatty acids.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.160
So what about
unsaturated fatty acids?

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.330
Well, it is not that
you just stop and don't

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.710
make it fully saturated.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.550
Nature, first, makes a
fully saturated fatty acid.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.940
And then it comes back and
reoxidizes the fully saturated

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:20.180
fatty acid to introduce double
bonds in the right positions.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:40.050
And so for unsaturated, so you
start with a saturated fatty

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.310
acid of the desired length.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.870
So you make that first.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:37:00.810
And then you use so-called
desaturase enzymes

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:19.830
to introduce double bonds at
the desired location, all right?

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.100
So it's a little
counterintuitive,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.430
but this is effectively
why you end up

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.040
with double bonds at
the stereotyped places.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.590
So, remember, the
delta 9 position

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.990
is the first place,
when we describe

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:36.050
the nomenclature of fatty
acids, where we always

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.270
put the first double bond.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.930
Why does nature do it this way?

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.630
Well, it's very
hard to say that,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.300
but you can imagine
evolution of how you would

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.070
get these enzyme activities.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.280
It's hard to evolve a fatty
acid synthase complex that

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.430
would stop doing the
reduction reaction only

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.810
at specific locations.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.810
And so you probably
first generate

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.320
these fatty acids fully
saturated because that's

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.230
the way an enzyme could
do it and then, later,

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.030
have a different enzyme
that can pick out

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.610
a location on a
saturated fatty acid

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.760
to introduce a double bond.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.580
All right, so how can we
introduce a double bond?

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.440
Well, that's an
oxidation reaction.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.420
And so if we're going to
do an oxidation reaction,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.840
we need a place for the
electrons that we move.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.890
So if we oxidize the fatty
acid, that's removing electrons.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.230
Those electrons have
to go somewhere.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.190
You might imagine, if we're
oxidizing a carbon-carbon bond,

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:41.790
we've seen that
reaction before when

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.370
we did succinate to fumarate.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.610
Succinate dehydrogenase, that
was an oxidation reaction.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.960
We used FAD.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.770
We saw it with the
fatty acid breakdown

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.370
when we first put
the double bond in.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.120
We used FAD.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.600
And so, indeed, FAD is
used in this reaction,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.460
but it does not work
like other FAD reactions

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.850
to carry out this oxidation.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:15.400
For whatever reason, the way
desaturases work is different.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.210
OK.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:22.120
So these desaturase
reactions use oxygen

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.190
as a final electron acceptor.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:37.090
And they work via a
mini-electron transport chain

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.000
in the ER in eukaryotes OK.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.420
So it's a little bit of a
different weird mechanism.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:53.200
But if we think here's
our carbon-carbon bond

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.110
that we're going to oxidize
to introduce a double bond

00:39:56.110 --> 00:40:01.330
and desaturate our
lipid, so what is that?

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.720
Well, it's basically
this reaction.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.220
OK.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:12.810
So this is, rather than just
remove this as a hydride ion,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.540
it turns out that
those electrons

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:22.620
go to oxygen, which, of
course, will generate one water

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.550
molecule.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.380
But there's two
oxygen there, so you

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.750
need to generate a
second water molecule.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.340
Those electrons have to
come from somewhere else.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:36.090
And those electrons come from
this little mini-electron

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.210
transport chain.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.400
So if we oxidize iron,
we can get electrons

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.940
from that reaction.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:59.030
And so this ends up generating
a double bond in the fatty acid

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.300
with two of the electrons going
to oxygen and the other two

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.810
electrons coming from this
mini-electron transport chain

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.760
in this desaturase complex
in the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.300
all right?

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.950
And so, of course,
those electrons

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.900
have to come from somewhere.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.290
So we have to re-reduce.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.540
This iron we oxidize to
get the electrons from.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:26.510
And so this works via
an electron transport

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.490
chain similar to
what we saw before,

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.480
where it's this whole series
of oxidation and reduction

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:39.230
reactions that does happen
to involve FAD and FADH2.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.220
But ultimately, the electrons
are coming from NADH.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.000
So oxidation of
NADH ultimately is

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.200
providing electrons that
together with oxidation here

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.350
lead to the reduction
of oxygen to water.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.790
And you can, of course,
read more about this

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.310
if you're interested
in it, but it's

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.250
important to point out that
this process works by a slightly

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:14.490
different mechanism than
you might predict from sort

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.580
of the general principles of
the way most double bonds are

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.320
introduced in carbon-carbon
molecules in metabolism.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.630
Why it works this
way is something

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.720
we can only speculate about.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.400
OK.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:41.900
Now, mammals only use
a disaccharase enzyme

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.830
that, in a fully
saturated fatty acid,

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:57.100
can only introduce a double
bond at the delta 9 position.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:06.335
That is between carbons 9 and
10 of a fully saturated fatty

00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:06.835
acid.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.450
And that's because they only
have an enzyme complex that

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.120
does that.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.050
So that is they can take an 18,
0 newly synthesized fatty acid

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.940
and they can make an 18, 1--

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:28.980
or we can make an 18, 1
delta 9 fatty acid, OK?

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.170
That's the only
desaturase enzyme

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.410
we have to put into a
saturated fatty acid.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.330
That is to make completely
a de novo unsaturated fatty

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.810
acid, which is one
of the reasons why

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.940
we don't have a lot of
polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.840
Now, we do have enzyme
complexes that work similarly

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.290
to these that can add double
bonds at other locations,

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.260
but they have to start having
a double bond already present

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.850
in those locations.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.220
Many of those lipids have
to come from the diet.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.160
And that's that concept of
essential lipids, something

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.740
that we have to eat from a plant
or bacteria that already has

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.270
a double bond there
in order to add

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:10.105
double bonds to make some of
our other polyunsaturated fatty

00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:10.605
acids.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:18.460
So that's how fatty
acids are made.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.030
But as I alluded to
earlier, all of this

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.810
is taking place in the cytosol.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:30.760
And if we're doing all of
this work in the cytosol,

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.920
maybe you notice
that we actually

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.320
have another problem
that nature has to solve.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.590
And that is, because we're
doing all this from acetyl-CoA,

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.560
and so we have to have
acetyl-CoA in the cytosol

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.150
to have this work.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.470
But acetyl-CoA, all
the ways we've talked

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.830
or most of the ways we've
talked about producing it,

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.690
happen in the mitochondria.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.430
Remember, acetyl-CoA
can't get across

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.560
the mitochondrial membrane.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.160
So we need a way
to get acetyl-CoA

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.370
out of the mitochondria into
the cytosol for this whole thing

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:03.390
to work.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.190
Put another way--
so if we draw here,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.900
here's glucose to pyruvate.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.070
That's glycolysis.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:17.200
Remember to turn that
pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.100
We had to move the pyruvate
into the mitochondria.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:27.520
That's where the PDH complex
was to generate the acetyl-CoA.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.820
But if we need acetyl-CoA in the
cytosol for fatty acid synthase

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:40.530
to make fatty
acids, we basically

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.680
need a way to get that
acetyl-CoA back out

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.510
of the mitochondria in order
to generate fatty acids.

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:50.670
Other big source
of, remember, was

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.690
we start with a fatty
acid in the mitochondria,

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:59.250
run fatty acid oxidation.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.860
Again, fatty acid oxidation
in the mitochondria

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.690
generates acetyl-CoA
in the mitochondria.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.730
We're going to use it
to rebuild a fatty acid,

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.070
need to get it out of the
mitochondria into the cytosol.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.360
Coenzyme A is not
membrane permeable.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.150
Remember, we had shuttles
to get fatty acids

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.250
in the mitochondria.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.280
We did the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction here

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.340
to begin with.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.660
And so it's a problem
to get this giant CoA,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.940
the CoA from the acetyl-CoA,
out of the mitochondria

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.765
into the cytosol.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:37.130
OK.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:42.680
So one solution to this,
to getting acetyl CoA

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.600
in the cytosol, is simply
to start with acetate, OK?

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.960
That is take the CoA
group off and just have

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.030
an acetate molecule.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.500
And of course, acetate or
acetic acid, well, that's food.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.490
That's vinegar.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.480
All right, the salad you ate
has acetate in it, acetyl-CoA.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.890
It can be in the cytosol.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.740
We can make acetate if you
look back at your notes

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.850
about how we
metabolized alcohol.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:11.990
So alcohol gets
metabolized to acetate.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.770
And so that acetate
in the cytosol,

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.880
we can just add a CoA
group to it in the cytosol.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.960
And how do we do that?

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.270
Well, we saw the reaction
to do this already.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.490
OK.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:40.320
And this is basically when
we added any fatty acid

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.000
to make a fatty acyl-CoA.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.150
Remember, the free fatty acid
turned into a fatty acyl-CoA.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:48.120
We add this reaction
where we used ATP.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.600
We added the AMP to it.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.460
And then that
[INAUDIBLE] pyrophosphate

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.040
can drive it forward with the
two pyrophosphate molecules

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.470
and take the AMP off
and adds a CoA group.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:59.970
If you look back
in your notes, it's

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.240
the identical reaction to
how we made a fatty acyl-CoA.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.720
Well, there's also an enzyme
that can act on acetate

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.840
and do this to make acetyl-CoA.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.680
And that's great.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.590
It's a way to make
acetyl-CoA in the cytosol

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.210
if you start with acetate.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.190
However, this is
not the way it works

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:26.460
if you already have an
acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:31.080
And so if in the
mitochondria you already have

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.990
an acetyl-CoA--

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:45.600
so this can come from
pyruvate via the PDH reaction.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.640
It can come from fatty acid
oxidation, this acetyl-CoA

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.770
in the mitochondria, all right?

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:57.150
Well, what do we talk about
doing with it in the TCA cycle?

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.390
Well, the TCA cycle, we
can use citrate synthase

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.610
to generate this
citrate molecule.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.860
And it turns out citrate
itself can be used as a carrier

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:19.650
to export the acetyl-CoA from
the mitochondria to the side

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:24.780
cytosol, such that now, when
you have citrate in the side

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:34.830
cytosol, that citrate can now be
used where you basically carry

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.850
out the opposite of the
citrate synthase reaction

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.800
to regenerate acetyl-CoA
and oxaloacetate.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.990
Well, if one direction
is favorable,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.400
the other direction is
going to be not favorable.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.420
And so you need energy input
in one of the directions.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.725
And so this costs you ATP.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.750
And this is carried
out by an enzyme

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:13.050
called ATP citrate lyase,
often abbreviated ACLY.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:21.330
So ATP citrate lyase allows
you to basically reverse

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.730
the citrate synthase
reaction, such

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.140
that you can shuttle acetyl-CoA
out of the mitochondria

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.760
to the cytosol using
citrate as a molecule.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.720
And then, of course,
that oxaloacetate

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.573
can be shuttled back into the
mitochondria via something

00:50:40.573 --> 00:50:42.240
like the malate-aspartate
shuttle, which

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.330
we describe several
lectures ago,

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:49.960
as a way to make this
a complete cycle.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.300
I want to spend a little bit
of time talking about this

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.180
because, here, a
lot of metabolism

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.600
begins to come
together, all right?

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.860
And so when do you want
to produce fatty acids?

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.740
We want to produce fatty acids
when you have a lot of ATP.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.310
And so if you have
a lot of ATP, this

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.250
is a situation
where the TCA cycle

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.480
isn't going to want to run.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.760
And so that favors citrate
export from the TCA cycle

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.530
into the cytosol.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:25.920
Remember, citrate was
this important regulator

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.420
of glycolysis.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.520
We talked about you
have a lot of citrate.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.590
Let's slow down glycolysis.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.630
Well, that citrate
in the side cytosol

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.170
also now provides a
source of acetyl-CoA

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.030
to take all that extra carbon
and turn it into fatty acids,

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.310
all right?

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:47.070
We also, in the process
of moving this out,

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.650
we generate oxaloacetate.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.030
Remember, oxaloacetate,
of course,

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.760
is part of the
malate-aspartate shuttle.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.040
We'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.980
But oxaloacetate in
the cytosol, that

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.100
was the product of the
pyruvate carboxylase reaction

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:06.330
to get oxaloacetate in the
cytosol so PEPCK can make

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.120
PEP and do gluconeogenesis.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.200
And so the same thing is
also taking oxaloacetate

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.540
and putting that in this
cytosol where it's a good thing

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.880
to do gluconeogenesis, which
is something else that you

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.150
want to do if you have a lot
of excess ATP to store carbon.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.800
And so this is really
set up in a way

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.870
that, now, you have your
citrate and oxaloacetate

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:30.690
in the cytosol, which
are the starting points

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:34.980
to generate either fat
or carbohydrate as a way

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:41.070
to store excess energy if you
have plenty of ATP around.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.460
Now, it turns out that
oxaloacetate in the cytosol

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.250
is also beneficial
in another way

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.630
because it can be part of a
series of enzyme reactions

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:58.110
that also benefits
fatty acid synthesis.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:02.730
And that's because it's a
substrate for an enzyme.

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:03.900
It can create a substrate.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.980
It can create malate that's a
substrate for an enzyme called

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.750
malic enzyme, which is
another way to generate NADPH.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.220
All right, so let's
go through this.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:21.510
So remember, oxaloacetate
differs from malate

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:23.715
by an oxidation
reduction reaction.

00:53:23.715 --> 00:53:28.770
So remember, we described malate
dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:32.040
to turn malate into oxaloacetate
in the malate-aspartate

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.670
shuttle.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:35.790
We pointed out that this
enzyme can run in reverse,

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:43.530
and so can be used to
regenerate NAD in the cytosol.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.230
And this oxaloacetate
back to malate

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:48.270
as part of the
malate-aspartate shuttle

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:53.010
was a way to regenerate NAD
to help keep glycolysis going

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:54.750
as an alternative
to fermentation,

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.590
get those electrons
into the mitochondria,

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.500
so we give them to oxygen.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:04.270
Well, this malate that's made
is the substrate not just

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.460
for the malate-aspartate
shuttle to bring electrons

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:11.200
into the mitochondria, but is
also a substrate for an enzyme

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.835
called malic enzyme.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:19.060
And malic enzyme is
a way to make NADPH.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.410
Well, how does this work?

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:32.670
OK.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.435
So here's malate.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:55:00.230
All right, so if we reoxidize
this alcohol to bring malate

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:09.270
back to oxaloacetate, so
that generates hydride ion,

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:14.640
which can, of course, be
given to a nicotinamide group,

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.840
the malic enzyme.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:21.810
The nicotinamide group is
NAD+ to generate NADPH.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.320
NAPDH is, of course,
useful for reducing power

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.920
to make fatty acids.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.140
So what does this generate?

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:32.270
Well, this generates--
again, all I've done

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.820
is regenerate oxaloacetate.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.430
OK.

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.800
This is oxaloacetate.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.330
It turns out this oxaloacetate
is retained on the enzyme.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:52.050
And remember, oxaloacetate is a
beta-keto acid, so acid group,

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:58.670
alpha, beta, beta-keto acid.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:05.261
And beta carboxylation
is favorable.

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:08.150
You've now seen this
many, many times.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.670
This is going to
generate enolpyruvate.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.330
Enolpyruvate will want
to rearrange to pyruvate.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.260
And so, effectively, I can
turn malate into pyruvate

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.990
and generate NADPH.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:40.020
And that's what
malic enzyme does.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.740
And if you look back at the
malate-aspartate shuttle,

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.960
we used oxaloacetate
to make malate.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.590
And it was malate that was
sent back to the mitochondria.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:53.160
Well, here, we can also
use it to make pyruvate.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.010
And then the pyruvate can
go back to the mitochondria

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.910
and use pyruvate carboxylase
to generate acetate

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.550
via pyruvate
carboxylase as a way

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:06.880
to do anaplerosis for this
mini-cycle if you want.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.880
A lot of moving
parts here, let me

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.190
be explicit about
what's going on

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:16.410
and show you how I can build
a series of reactions here

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:22.050
that is very useful if
I want to generate that.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.550
OK.

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:26.120
So here's glycolysis.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.570
Remember to run glycolysis.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:33.050
I need a source of NAD+
plus for the GAPDH reaction.

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:35.000
If I'm not going to
ferment the pyruvate,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.760
I need to deal with that NAD+.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.780
Well, if I send now
that pyruvate here

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:51.150
into the mitochondria,
that pyruvate

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:54.500
can go through the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction,

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.820
make acetyl-CoA.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:03.785
Acetyl-CoA combine with
oxaloacetate to make citrate.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:09.480
OK.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:21.590
Export that citrate from the
mitochondria to the cytosol.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:26.135
Run the ATP citrate
lyase reaction.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.150
Now, I have acetyl-CoA
in the cytosol

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:46.310
and can use that to
generate fatty acids.

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:54.450
And of course,
that requires NADPH

00:58:54.450 --> 00:59:00.360
as reducing power to make
those fatty acids, OK?

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:07.110
So all series of reactions that
you've seen many, many times,

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:13.500
this is glycolysis,
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:24.090
citrate synthase, ATP citrate
lyase that we just described

00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:29.400
and, of course, this over
here acetyl-CoA carboxylase,

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.760
of course, and fatty
acid synthase to do that.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:42.240
All right, now, that's great,
but we have this NAD+ to deal

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.530
with.

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.550
And we need sources of NADPH
to balance all the electrons

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.265
to make this work.

00:59:49.265 --> 00:59:50.640
Let's show how we
can incorporate

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.580
malate dehydrogenase and
malic enzyme as a way

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.620
to make all this balanced.

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:11.920
So if we take oxaloacetate
and make malate,

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:19.640
this is our malate
dehydrogenase reaction.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.140
I've now regenerated the
NAD I need in the cytosol

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:29.990
to keep that carbon flowing
in from glucose to make

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.770
acetylcholine, right?

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.930
Now, I have malate.

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:40.450
I can use malic enzyme to
turn malate into pyruvate.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:56.440
That's going to serve
as a source of NADPH

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.980
that I can use, again,
NADPH in the cytosol

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.940
to drive fatty acid
synthase in the cytosol.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.010
Obviously, you need more
than one NADPH to do this,

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:10.330
but at least it generates
NADPH's reducing power

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.920
to make the fatty acids.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:20.680
And of course, take
that pyruvate, bring it

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.490
back in the mitochondria.

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:34.915
I can run the pyruvate
carboxylase reaction.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.960
And I'll regenerate oxaloacetate
in the mitochondria.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.360
And now, I have a
balanced cycle where

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.530
I can run this cycle to turn
glucose carbon into acetyl-CoA

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.460
for fat and, in the process,
also make some NADPH's reducing

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.170
power to support my fatty
acid synthase reaction.

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:05.880
This is just one way that I
can take all these reactions we

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.310
talked about and
build a pathway that's

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:13.530
balanced, at least for the
NAD-NADH oxidation piece,

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.225
and gives us something useful.

01:02:15.225 --> 01:02:17.340
Well, it gives us
ATP from glycolysis

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.180
and also gives NADPH from
the malic enzyme reaction

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:21.870
to do this.

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.160
And what does it cost me?

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.990
Well, it costs me a
bunch of ATP, right?

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.355
It cost me ATP here.

01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:30.270
It costs me ATP there, of
course a lot of ATP up here.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.660
But you're doing this when
there's energy excess.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.670
You have plenty of ATP around.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.340
And it's a way that
nature then can

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.220
use this high-energy, high-ATP
state as a way to store carbon,

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.280
ultimately, reduce carbon
is fatty acids that

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:53.660
can be used later when
times are not so good.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:59.910
All right, so let's
spend a couple

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.760
of minutes talking
about the regulation

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.530
of fatty acid synthesis.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.930
It's very straightforward,
not really

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:07.330
a whole lot to talk about.

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:14.190
You really only want to make fat
if you have high ATP-ADP ratio.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.900
This is a situation excess
citrate in the cytosol.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:26.830
And so high citrate, which,
remember, inhibits glycolysis--

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:39.450
well, high citrate is going to
activate fatty acid synthase.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.850
OK.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.210
The big step, though, is
acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.190
That's what makes
the malonyl-CoA.

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.760
That's the big
change in delta g.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.950
By all the reasons we
talked about before, that's

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:54.540
a step you want to regulate.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:04:03.390
And so it turns out that high
levels of palmitoyl-CoA--

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.050
that is the 16, 0
fatty acid, the product

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.720
of the fatty acid
synthase reaction.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:21.460
This is going to inhibit
acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:26.290
It makes sense-- have a
lot of product around.

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:28.060
Stop making it.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.880
Stop the step that costs
the most, that's hardest

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.540
to go back to generate it.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.540
OK?

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.500
What's the other thing?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:42.550
Well, you only want to do this
if cells have enough energy

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.780
to do it.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.960
What's their energy charge?

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.500
ATP-AMP ratio-- if AMP is high,
you also want to inhibit ACC.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.840
Low energy-- don't
try to make fat.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.440
That's basically what you need
to know about the regulation

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.810
of fatty acid synthase.

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:02.240
Now, of course, that's
making fatty acids.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.420
But of course, most
fatty acids are not

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.220
floating around free in nature.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.170
They're stored as lipids.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.630
And so just to remind
you, here is an image

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:11.770
from an earlier lecture.

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:15.290
These were the image of a fat
cell, as well as a plant cell

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:15.790
here.

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:18.820
They both have
these lipid droplets

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.920
that are filled with
these neutral lipids,

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.990
these triacylglycerides.

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:27.235
And so you want to store
the fatty acid for energy.

01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:29.590
You put it into a
triacylglyceride,

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.180
pop it into a lipid droplet.

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.680
And now, you have
this efficient way

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.520
to store all this reduced carbon
without having to carry around

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.680
the weight of the water.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.610
Or maybe you want to use this
to generate membranes, right?

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:45.370
Phospholipids, you need
to generate phospholipids.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:47.440
Both triacylglycerides,
phospholipids

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.110
are built on this
glycerol backbone.

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.910
And I just want
to mention briefly

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.920
the pathway that
cells really use

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.820
or a pathway the cells use
to make these glycerol based

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.050
lipids.

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.220
And so as we talked
about before, here's

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:10.090
our old friend dihydroxyacetone
phosphate from glycolysis.

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:21.270
Remember, if we reduce this
ketone to the alcohol, that's

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:24.570
how we made glycerol.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:28.320
It turns out, first,
before doing this,

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.330
the way nature does it is it
first adds the fatty acid.

01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:38.220
So it takes the fatty
acyl-CoA, releases the CoA.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:48.970
And you end up with
this intermediate, OK?

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:52.990
It's this molecule
that then you reduce.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.770
Of course, you can
reduce it within NADH.

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:01.270
You can also reduce
it with NADPH.

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:08.500
And that gives us this
phospho-monoacylglycerol, OK?

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.320
So this molecule, with that
being the alcohol instead

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.430
of the ketone--

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:16.300
phospho-monoacylglycerol.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:21.580
Now, come on, add
another fatty acyl-CoA.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.250
Releasing the CoA, that gives
us a phospho-diacylglycerol,

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:32.740
so, now, a fatty acid esterified
to that middle carbon.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.550
And then this
phospho-diacylglycerol,

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:44.770
we can remove the phosphate
to get just a diacylglycerol

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:50.710
and then generate a
triacylglycerol by putting

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:57.660
on a third fatty acid
from a fatty acyl-CoA,

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.100
releasing the CoA.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.110
And now, we have this
triacylglyceride,

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:05.310
this neutral lipid that can be
packed into the lipid droplet

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:11.650
here and store energy as
reduced carbon for later.

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:12.490
That's great.

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:17.740
But what if we want to
make a phospholipid?

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.560
Well, I'll show you
briefly how this works.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.359
Don't worry about
the details of this.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:26.109
I just want you to have a flavor
for how this happens because it

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:29.439
illustrates another way
that nature repurposes

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.090
the same reactions
over and over again.

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.729
And so as one releases
this phosphate

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:43.910
from the diacylglycerol, it now
picks up head group on there.

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:47.890
And so one that can be
picked up is ethanolamine.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.340
And the ethanolamine
comes from a molecule

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:55.060
called CDP ethanolamine.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.310
If you're interested in the
structure of ethanolamine,

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.740
be reminded of that, you
can, of course, look it up.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:05.979
But basically, it's ethanolamine
attached to a CDP group

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:11.860
releasing a CMP group, which
makes a phospho-ethanolamine.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.130
And then that
phospho-ethanolamine

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:25.210
can be turned into
phosphatidylethanolamine.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.569
A phospholipid
phosphatidylethanolamine

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.290
can be turned into
phosphatidylcholine.

01:09:39.005 --> 01:09:40.380
And if you look
up the difference

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.569
between choline
and ethanolamine,

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.310
it's adding three methyl groups.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.670
And we'll talk about how to
do that in one of the upcoming

01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.410
lectures, all right?

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:51.960
And so here's two of
the major phospholipids,

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.570
phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine.

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:58.440
They are added to
a diacylglyceride

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.680
by basically taking the
phosphate off and adding

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:07.140
a phosphate from CDP
ethanolamine releasing CMP.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.250
What's CDP ethanolamine?

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.570
Well, it's very similar
to how we already

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:18.030
talked about with UDP glucose
in glycogen metabolism.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:27.030
And so if you start with the
amino alcohol ethanolamine,

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:28.980
which itself is
made from serine,

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:33.110
but we don't have time
to talk about how,

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:47.820
this can basically be
phosphorylated by ATP

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.500
to put a phosphate
on the alcohol

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.260
to make phosphoethanolamine.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.810
So you have a
phosphoethanolamine.

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:02.260
And then that
phosphoethanolamine

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:13.390
can react with a CTP,
releasing a pyrophosphate such

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:22.450
that the phospho from the
ATP is replaced by the CDP.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:25.360
You end up getting
a CDP ethanolamine

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.688
with two pyrophosphate coming
off by a series of reactions

01:11:30.688 --> 01:11:32.230
that, if you look
back in your notes,

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:36.460
will look identical to how
we made UDP glucose in making

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.370
glycogen. And then
the CDP ethanolamine

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.860
transfers the
phosphoethanolamine

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.290
onto the diacylglyceride
to give you

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:46.960
the phosphatidylethanolmine.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.040
Why do I mention this?

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.490
Just because I want you to have
a flavor of how phospholipids

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:56.980
are made, realize that here is
a repurposing of a same series

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.920
and type of reactions as we
saw for glycogen metabolism,

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.790
but now to make
phospholipids, and also

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:06.250
to point out that it's
really expensive to make

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.900
a phospholipid, all right?

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:11.470
You need three ATPs just to
add this ethanolamine group

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:12.050
to there.

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:14.540
So that's actually
fairly expensive.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.680
And so a lot of
energy goes into cells

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.280
building these phospholipids.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.790
Now, for the last
bit of time today, I

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:29.620
want to return to a brief
topic of another lipid.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.500
And that's this guy
here, cholesterol.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.130
And so you'll remember
that cholesterol

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:43.180
is this complex ring structure,
lots of reduced carbon there.

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:48.080
It's a molecule
that mammals use,

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.470
if you recall, to keep
their membranes fluid.

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:54.590
Now, mammals, of course,
can make cholesterol.

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.990
And you probably have
heard about cholesterol

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.473
because high levels
of cholesterol

01:12:59.473 --> 01:13:00.890
have been linked
to heart disease.

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:03.920
And so a lot of people talk
about what their cholesterol

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.750
levels are, something
doctors check a lot.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:10.790
And this has led the
recognition that cholesterol

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:13.580
can be associated
with vascular disease,

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:19.160
has led to the development of a
class of drugs called statins.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.080
And statins are one of the
most commonly prescribed drugs

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.310
out there.

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:29.150
They're a drug that blocks an
enzyme in cholesterol synthesis

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:33.440
and have been very effective at
lowering risk of heart attacks

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.580
and strokes.

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.070
They've also been
a huge windfall,

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:40.550
a huge moneymaker for lots
of pharmaceutical companies.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.170
And so if you care
about medicine,

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:43.420
they're important to medicine.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.800
If you care about
biotech, they also

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.950
were very important
in supporting

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:52.910
the pharmaceutical industry.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:54.890
All right, now,
we don't have time

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:57.950
to talk fully about how
cholesterol synthesis works.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.510
It's a long pathway.

01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:01.250
You can look it up
if you're interested.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:02.750
You have all the
tools that you need

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:06.410
to understand all of the
steps to make cholesterol.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:08.600
You'll see you build
it from acyl-CoA.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.300
You need a bunch of NADPH.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.580
I don't have time to go
through all those steps.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.630
But I will discuss
the initial steps,

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:18.260
so you can understand
how statins work.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.510
Because that's important in
medicine, and some of you,

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:22.190
I know, want to go
to medical school.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.440
But apart from that,
these early steps

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.520
affect other aspects of
biology, making lipid tails

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.820
for signaling proteins,
also introduces

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.260
a discussion of
ketones, which are

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.030
another important
metabolic fuel that we

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:37.740
need to talk about as well.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:44.510
Now, the way that one makes
these things is basically you

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:49.610
start with three
acetyl-CoA molecules.

01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.810
OK.

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:07.500
So here's two
acetyl-CoA molecules.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:17.100
We can combine those two
together, releasing a CoA.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:25.260
And this is really
the identical reaction

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:32.745
that we just saw for the early
steps in fatty acid synthase.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.370
OK.

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:44.010
That generates this molecule
called acetoacetyl-CoA.

01:15:50.330 --> 01:16:08.380
And then this can combine
with yet another acetyl-CoA

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:42.530
to make this molecule, which is
called Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl,

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:48.048
or HMG, CoA, all right?

01:16:48.048 --> 01:16:50.340
I don't need to describe any
of these reactions to you.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.410
As I said, this is just
what we showed earlier

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.180
for fatty acid synthesis.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.020
And this reaction is
the identical reaction

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.900
to citrate synthase
in the TCA cycle

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.640
and takes these three, 1,
2, 3 acetyl-CoAs and makes

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.710
this molecule, HMG-CoA.

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:15.900
HMG-CoA is the
substrate for an enzyme

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:24.000
called HMG-CoA reductase.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.300
HMG-CoA reductase
is the famous target

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:37.560
of statins to block
cholesterol synthesis.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:45.860
What HMG-CoA reductase does
is it releases that CoA group

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:56.090
and uses two NADPH
oxidizing it to two NAD+.

01:17:56.090 --> 01:18:01.340
That effectively
is, when you release

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.840
this CoA, what are
you're left with?

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.670
The acid, you reduce it twice.

01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:07.310
And you end up with the alcohol.

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:35.490
And that gives
you this molecule,

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:37.370
which is called mevalonate.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:52.020
And mevalonate is what you
use to build cholesterol.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.250
And so statins, by
blocking HMG-CoA reductase,

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:58.620
basically block
the reactions that

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:02.460
are necessary to make the
precursor mevalonate, which is

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:04.540
necessary to make cholesterol.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.740
And that's why statins
stop cholesterol synthesis.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:12.060
Now, mevalonate, it
turns out, is also

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.820
used for other things in cells.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:18.180
It's not just used
to make cholesterol.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.730
It's also used to make
a class of molecules

01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:21.730
called isoprenoids.

01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:24.930
Isoprenoids are important.

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:27.660
And you'll encounter them if
you study signaling or anything

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.970
like that because
these make things

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:38.140
like the farnesylation
lipid modifications that

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.920
are oftentimes added to the
membrane associated proteins,

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.900
like signaling proteins.

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:47.530
And so statins will also
block the production

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:52.180
of these molecules that are
important for these various

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.050
signaling proteins.

01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:57.940
And so you should have
some understanding

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:02.860
of what mevalonate is,
where it comes from,

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.170
that it's involved in
cholesterol and isoprenoid

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:09.140
synthesis, and that it's
the target of statins.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.010
And of course, you
didn't need a whole lot.

01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:14.840
We already have all the tools
to understand that pathway.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.740
And if you look up isoprenoid
synthesis, cholesterol

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:21.730
synthesis, you'll see you'll
have the tools to understand

01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:23.960
that as well.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.660
The last thing I
want to talk about

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:31.450
is taking the acetoacetyl-CoA.

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:35.260
And if I take the CoA group
off, what I'm left with

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.880
is a molecule called
acetoacetate, OK?

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:52.990
This is basically two
acetyl-CoAs brought together

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:55.075
losing CoAs times 2.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:03.900
OK.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.270
So this here is acetoacetate.

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:13.080
And acetoacetate is a
canonical ketone body.

01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:17.600
What is a ketone body?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.480
Well, it turns out ketones
are an alternative fuel

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:24.500
that the body can use to
glucose, primarily the brain.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.470
And so for reasons that
no one really understands,

01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:32.660
a quirk of human and
mammalian physiology,

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:36.500
is that the brain prefers
to use glucose as its fuel.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.230
If glucose is not available,
it doesn't use fatty acids.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.690
It uses ketone bodies instead.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:47.870
And so the ketone is acetate
is the canonical ketone body.

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:52.350
This underlies the keto diet,
which has become very popular.

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:54.140
And so what is the keto diet?

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.630
Well, the keto diet is you
don't eat any carbohydrates.

01:21:57.630 --> 01:21:59.960
And so if you don't
eat carbohydrates,

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.420
you don't have a
source of glucose.

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.200
The liver, of course,
can do gluconeogenesis.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.470
But if you run out of things
to make and turn into glucose,

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:11.960
now the liver gets into trouble.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.290
Remember, we talked about with
anaplerosis of the TCA cycle.

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:17.780
There's no way to turn
two-carbon units that are made

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.140
from fat, acetyl-CoA from fat--

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.720
mammals cannot turn that
back into glucose because we

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.090
don't have the glyoxylate cycle.

01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:30.170
And so we can't turn
fat into glucose.

01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:33.030
And so when the liver can
no longer make glucose,

01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:36.800
it will take acetyl-CoA
from the breakdown of fat

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.990
and make ketones instead.

01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:44.020
And the ketone is
this acetoacetate.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.500
People do the keto diet because
ketones, like acetoacetate,

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.900
will suppress appetite.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.200
And that's at least how one
way it's thought to work.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.440
But I want to talk about
what these ketones are

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:59.710
and how they fit
into metabolism.

01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:01.600
So here's acetoacetate.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:11.150
If you notice, acetoacetate
is a beta-keto acid.

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:17.300
Alpha, beta, the ketone
is beta to the acid group.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.170
So a beta-keto acid,
as I've said now

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:26.030
many, many, many
times, beta-keto acids

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:33.710
can undergo decarboxylation
that generates

01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:38.810
the enol, which can be
rearranged to the keto group.

01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:41.240
And in that case,
what's the keto group?

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:45.750
Well, the keto group
would be this molecule,

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:49.862
which is acetone,
fingernail polish remover.

01:23:49.862 --> 01:23:51.320
If you go to medical
school, you'll

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.460
learn that, if type
1 diabetics have

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.780
a state of a physiology
called ketoacidosis,

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.420
we don't have time to go
into what drives that state,

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.130
that physiological state.

01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:08.300
But it's basically a state
with very high ketones.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.460
They smell like acetone.

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.620
The reason is because
they have very high levels

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.630
of acetate, the ketone body.

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:19.310
And some of that spontaneously
carboxylates to make acetone,

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:20.740
all right?

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.030
The body does this, though.

01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.790
It's making the
acetoacetate as a way

01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:26.380
to give food to the brain.

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.120
But because acetoacetate
is unfavorable,

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.460
that's not the form that
is put into the blood.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:39.610
Instead, it undergoes an
oxidation reduction reaction

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:46.180
where this ketone is
reduced to the alcohol

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.970
or interconverted between
the ketone and the alcohol.

01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:50.180
Something gets oxidized.

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.347
Something else gets reduced.

01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.290
NAD, NADH is the donor.

01:24:53.290 --> 01:25:01.860
And that leads to
this molecule, which

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.820
is called beta-hydroxybutyrate.

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.310
And beta-hydroxybutyrate
is the canonical ketone

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.230
that circulates in your blood.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:17.115
And measurement of
beta-hydroxybutyrate levels

01:25:17.115 --> 01:25:18.490
really tells you
if you're really

01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:22.220
doing the ketone diet properly.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:28.110
So basically, your liver, if
it doesn't have enough glucose,

01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:29.330
will have to break down fat.

01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:31.950
It can't turn the acetyl-CoA
from fat into glucose.

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:34.340
So instead, it'll turn
it into acetoacetate,

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.760
which will convert to the more
stable beta-hydroxybutyrate.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.670
And then the more stable
beta-hydroxybutyrate

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:45.590
can be oxidized by peripheral
tissues, predominantly

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:48.020
the brain, as an
alternative source of fuel

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:52.550
to glucose when the liver
can't maintain glucose.

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:56.060
To why this happens
this way, no one

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.640
really knows why it uses
ketones instead of that.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.950
But it fits with
all the physiology,

01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:03.410
and it also fits the
metabolism that we've already

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:08.252
learned about to see
why it works this way.

01:26:08.252 --> 01:26:09.710
I just want to
point out, for those

01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:12.620
of you who are doing the
keto diet, to do it properly.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.630
Yes, you have to
limit carbohydrates.

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:16.710
That's the most
popular way to do it.

01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:19.190
But to really make
this work, you also

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:22.190
have to eliminate other
sources of carbon that

01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:25.720
can be used for gluconeogenesis,
mostly amino acid,

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.300
so lowering protein.

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.680
So a true ketogenic
diet is really all fat

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.960
because that is what basically
makes acetyl-CoA really

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.290
the only carbon source
that the liver can use.

01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:44.030
And then it has to only generate
ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate,

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.510
which then circulates as an
alternative oxidizable carbon

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:49.550
source for the brain.

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:50.660
OK.

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.660
Thanks so much.

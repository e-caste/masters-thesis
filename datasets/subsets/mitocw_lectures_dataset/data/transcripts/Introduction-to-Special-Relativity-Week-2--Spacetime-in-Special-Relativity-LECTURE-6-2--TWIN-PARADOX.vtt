00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.240
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.240
In this section, we talk
about the famous twin paradox.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.960
It's probably the most famous
paradox in special relativity.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.610
I want to get to
the bottom of this,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.790
and understand
really where there

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.250
is a conflicting or
contradictory statement

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.900
in this story.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.900
Let me just first say that
this is personal to me.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.460
I do have a twin
brother, and you

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.300
can see three pictures of
myself and my twin brother here.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.230
We were very little on our
first day of school in Germany.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.260
You get a little
box of candy when

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.840
you go to schools to make it
more attractive to actually

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.860
learn and study.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.780
And then a picture,
which is probably already

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.010
about 10 years old.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.740
What you can take away
from here is clearly

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.480
moving clocks are slow.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.340
It turns out that
my twin brother

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.710
lives in the very same
village in Germany

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.860
where I grew up,
where we both grew up,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.350
while I traveled the world
constantly and constantly

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.030
on the road between
France and Geneva

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.010
and Switzerland and
the United States.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.370
And again, I think there
is no dispute here.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.340
It can be seen from this picture
that your professor looks

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.480
much younger.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.020
I even have a more
recent picture.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.360
This is two years ago.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.730
The German Kris Kringle Market,
where I asked my brother

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.630
to take this picture for
this class, for 8.20.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.690
And again, I think the answer
to the question is clear.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.170
Professor Klute has aged less.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.710
All right.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.960
On a more serious
note, we're going

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.620
to quantitatively understand
and analyze the situation.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.660
And we use Bob and Alice again.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
In this situation,
here Bob stays local.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.390
Alice has a spacecraft, and she
moves with the velocity of 0.6,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.114
six times the speed of light,
a gamma factor of 1.25.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.330
The travel takes her
to a distant star,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.210
which is in this example
It's three light years away

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.000
from Bob, measured by Bob.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
The journey takes her, on
Bob's clock, five years,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.460
and the return takes
another five years.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.840
She doesn't spend much time.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.170
She wants to go home
as quickly as possible.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.630
If you analyze this,
from Alice's perspective,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.340
we see that for Alice, the
journey takes four years,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.650
and the distance traveled
for her in a spacecraft is 0.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.140
From Bob's perspective, the
journey, as seen by Alice,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.050
is only 3.2 years long.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.530
And so we find that
there's already a conflict.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.650
If you add the times together,
both ways, the inbound

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.240
and the outbound ways, 6.4
years is not equal to 10 years.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.440
So there's already a
contradictory statement

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.300
in this story.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.150
But the key to the
understanding of this problem

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.710
is that Alice, in
order to return,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.800
has to change reference points.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.070
And there, we do have to
resynchronize the clocks,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.800
if you want, or add a
specific extra factor.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.630
And we'll go back
to this when we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.520
look at space and [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.180
So the time, as seen
by Bob, is 3.2 years

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.750
for the outbound journey,
and then 3.6 years

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.750
in order to resynchronize
the clocks on the return,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.610
on the turning around.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.430
And then 3.2 years on the
return, which makes 10 years.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.800
And so that observation
of Bob, of Alice,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.960
is in agreement with
Bob's own clock.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.460
All right.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.350
So we saved the day here.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.960
Let's look at
space-time diagrams.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.120
The outbound journey
is shown here.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.910
You see I've got it--

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.960
in addition to Bob's
reference frame,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.420
I've plotted Alice's reference,
and it makes it easier

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.500
to understand what's going on.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.860
So we see in Alice's
reference frame,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.840
the journey takes four years.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.620
If you then go back to the
position in which Bob is,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.210
3.2 years have passed.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.750
So this is iffy.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.329
At the time when Alice
arrives we go back

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.350
to the position of Bob,
3.2 years have passed.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.980
We then turn around and
ask the very same question.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.870
At that time-- it's
still four years--

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.030
we go back the other
direction now to Bob,

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.225
we are already
much further ahead,

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:41.150
3.2 years plus 3.6 years.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.930
And then the journey continues,
and we add another 3.2 years

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.620
to the journey.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.080
When Alice and
Bob reunite, Alice

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.990
aged by eight years, 2 times
4, and Bob aged by 10 years.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.840
So the question now is,
there may be a paradox here.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.460
Is it possible that we
missed somehow that by--

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.540
and try to understand why this
is a probably not symmetric.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.690
Why can I not just use
the other reference frame,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.080
and just declare that
Alice stayed stationary

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.830
in her spacecraft while
Bob moved away with Earth

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.390
and then came back?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.180
Why are those two
things not consistent?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.400
The answer is that
it's not Bob who

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.730
has to change reference
frame, but Alice.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.380
It's Alice who has to do this.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.750
There is where the asymmetry is.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.740
You can argue if you want that,
in order for Alice to do that,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.510
she actually has to accelerate.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.700
But we don't have any
sort of discussion

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.550
of how the acceleration
actually went about.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.070
It's really the change
in reference frame

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.020
which is crucial
in this discussion,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.830
and causes the asymmetry
between Bob and Alice.

00:00:10.702 --> 00:00:12.160
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
All right, folks.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.715
Welcome back.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.618
So now we'll learn about the
process of learning to fly

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:24.160
and some of the
regulations around it

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.400
that will be on the test.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.980
All right, so when
you learn to fly,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.760
you'll pre-flight the
aircraft with the instructor.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.870
Learn about that-- how
to inspect everything.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.000
The first few lessons
are really about learning

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.100
to see the aircraft
attitude, seeing

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.400
whether you're pitched
up, pitched down, banked

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.000
left or right.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.340
Most people have a
fairly easy time with.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.040
Then you learn to
take off and land.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.350
As I said earlier, that
takes about five or 10 hours.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100
And in fact, people used
to solo after four hours

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.790
of flight training,
especially young people.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.540
Now it takes a little
longer, because they

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.580
want you to know
about more bureaucracy

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.680
and how to talk to the
control tower and so forth.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.160
A good trainer airplane--

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.530
why not start with the
best and just learn

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.410
how to fly your personal
Gulfstream or whatever.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.000
If it's a very heavy
airplane like a Gulfstream,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.520
which can weigh 100,000
pounds, then you

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.280
have to think ahead
because of inertia.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.680
The airplane tends to keep
doing whatever it was doing

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.290
five or 10 seconds earlier.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.540
At the same time, though,
a really tiny airplane

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.108
like some of the little
two-seaters, they are unstable.

00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:37.900
And they just get kicked
around by the wind

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.150
so much that you're not sure
if it's something you did

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.210
or something that the
environment did to you.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.860
Also people have gotten heavier.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.240
The owner of East
Coast Aero Club

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.960
says that when he started in
the '80s 85% of the customers

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.210
and instructors could train in
the two-seat Piper Tomahawk.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.590
Now 85% require training in
the four-seat Piper Warrior.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.270
You don't want it to be
too powerful, actually.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.280
And that's because
when you go from--

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.360
on a go around, for example,
and you go from near idle power

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.860
to full power, that's
a huge transition.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.390
And those left turning
tendencies that Tina mentioned

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.130
mean that you need immediate
and significant rudder input

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.880
and so forth.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.560
So an airplane
that has a narrower

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.550
band of possible powers
is easier to learn on.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.900
You want something that
won't spin if it's abused.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.870
And also ideally an airplane
that if you just let

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.540
go-- the Cessnas tend to
have this characteristic.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.570
They'll come out of
most bad situations

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.910
if you just let go of the yoke.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.680
So the best trainers--

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.917
my personal favorite
is the Diamond DA-40.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.500
It's kind of physically
uncomfortable,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.050
which is why I don't use it
as a family airplane anymore.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.860
The Cessna 172 and Piper
Warrior are the most popular.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.000
You can check these out.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.550
The Cirrus SR20 is the
most popular personal--

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.200
or the 20 and the 22 together--
the most popular family

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.240
and personal
airplane these days.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.920
They're OK trainers.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.370
And some airline training
programs and college training

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.910
programs use them.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.050
But they're a little bit
more challenging to handle

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.360
than the Cessnas,
Diamonds, and Pipers.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.450
The marginal operating
cost of all of these

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.030
is about $100 to $150 an hour.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.352
So flight schools usually
have to mark that up

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.560
a bit in order to stay in
business, because they have

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.500
to cover the fixed costs, as
well, of owning the aircraft,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.940
hangering, and paying insurance.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.170
But that cost includes the
fuel and the engine overhaul

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.150
and the prop overhaul.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.950
What about doing gliders?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.490
So we don't want to sell you
too hard on the idea of just

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.310
starting in a single
engine land airplane.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.280
You can go out to
Sterling, Massachusetts,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.940
get towed up to
3,000 feet, and then

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.290
on a handful of good
summer days stay up

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.450
by soaring in the thermals.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.990
Ridge lifts-- people have soared
all the way down for, I think,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.760
about 1,000 miles--

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.370
tend to be the
record for soaring.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.790
That's usually on following
the edge of a mountain range

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.970
where the wind blowing, let's
say, from the west generates

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.430
a lift right on the Western
edge of the mountain range,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.110
right in the center.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.400
You can be a Captain Sully-style
hero on every landing,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.900
actually.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.620
Raise your hand if
you think that there

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.340
was another pilot in the
aircraft with Captain Sully

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.570
or if he was by himself.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.670
Who thinks that there was
a second pilot in there?

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.770
OK, who knows the name
of the second pilot?

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.310
Without going to your phone,
does anybody in this room

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.220
know the name of
that second pilot?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.350
All right.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.760
AUDIENCE: Jeffrey Skiles.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.090
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Jeff
Skiles, all right.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.240
Hold on a sec.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.756
We've got to give
this guy his reward.

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:11.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.700
I'll pay out $20 to this
student for that answer.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.850
I only brought a
handful of cash,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.826
because I knew I
wouldn't need most of it.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.880
OK, a good trainer helicopter--

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.170
same issues.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.690
The really light helicopters--
the Robinson R-22

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.610
is very popular for
training, because it's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.820
inexpensive to operate.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.470
But it's so light that it's
unstable and gives people

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.850
the impression that heroic
skills are required.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.190
Also you want reasonable
amount of rotor inertia

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.300
for autorotations.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.960
And helicopters, a lot of the
training after those 10 hours--

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.640
after you've learned
to fly, you also

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.370
need to learn to fly a
helicopter with no engine.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.080
And that requires
making some adjustments

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.320
in the pitch of the rotating
blades or spinning wings.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.590
So if there is no
inertia in those blades,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.300
then it becomes a
little bit harder

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.335
to control during
the autorotation.

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:18.710
If you're a student, you may
not make the best landings--

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.040
so rugged skids.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.610
This ends up all pointing
towards the Robinson R-44.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.530
It's a four seat helicopter.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.110
And those extra two
empty seats in the back

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.090
give you a lot of
performance margin.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.760
That's more
expensive to operate.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.260
And therefore, the prices that
flight schools have to charge

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.400
are higher.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.860
Because all the
rotating components

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.930
get thrown out
every 2,200 hours.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.540
The blades, the transmissions--

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.410
there's more that
gets overhauled.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.560
OK, you can get a pilot's
certificate from FAA

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.940
by doing your pre-solo written
exam with an instructor

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.000
on the characteristics of
the aircraft and anything

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.820
that's important locally.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.470
Then you do some solo
flight after your training.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.240
You'll do some
flights by yourself.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.220
You will do cross-country trips.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.380
So you will go
with an instructor

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.470
on some trips that are at least
50 nautical miles if you're

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.910
in an airplane--

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.260
25 in a helicopter.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.460
That's called cross-country.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.440
You don't have to go all the
way to California or Alaska.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.460
And then you'll do a bit of
solo cross-country flying.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.040
You will do a
checkride preparation.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.350
That has to be, I believe,
at least three hours in prep

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.660
with an instructor
for your checkride.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.900
And once you take your
checkride with an FAA employee

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.330
or a designated
pilot examiner, you

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.250
get issued the
pilot certificate.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.100
It takes you about 40
hours of flight time.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.530
And I believe only 10
of that has to be solo.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.500
The other 30 is typically
with an instructor.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.850
55 hours is probably
more typical,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.860
but young people like
yourselves who do it intensively

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.020
can come and finish pretty
close to the 40 hours.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.520
There's my certificate.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.480
Notice it says airline
transport pilot there.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.270
Oh, let's use the
fancier feature.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.530
Airline transport pilot.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.322
So that's a different
level of certificate.

00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:13.310
There's private,
commercial, and ATP--

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.850
again, beyond the scope.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.060
Notice also there's
a hole punched in it.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.280
Because when you get
an additional rating,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.750
they issue a new certificate
and destroy the old one.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.568
OK.

00:08:25.568 --> 00:08:27.360
What can you do once
you have your private?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.450
You can go anywhere in the world
in a US registered airplane

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.110
and carry friends and
family as long as you're not

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.210
charging the money.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.250
You can fly at night.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.997
That's not true in
some other countries,

00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:44.039
but it is true in the US.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.547
You don't need any additional
rating to fly at night.

00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:48.630
You will have had three
hours of training in night

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.270
flying with an instructor.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.910
And you will fly
what you learned in.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.450
So if your mom has a
hot air balloon and that

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.890
was your first
aircraft, you will

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.960
have a rating for flying
that hot air balloon.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.840
You don't have to start
with a Cessna or similar.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.040
So Congress passes kind of
loose laws about aviation.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.470
But really most of
the things that you

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.630
might think of as
laws governing flying

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.370
are actually
regulations that are

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:29.880
drafted by the bureaucrats
in the FAA and the agency.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.740
A lot of the stuff is public.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.440
You can look up anybody
who claims to be

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.413
a pilot in the airman registry.

00:09:36.413 --> 00:09:37.830
One reason it's
not called a pilot

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.960
registry is that
there are actually

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.670
other functions for which
certificates are issued--

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.550
for example, flight engineer.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.010
Maybe in the old days,
there was navigator.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.000
Similarly, airplanes.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.125
If you see an
interesting airplane,

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.750
you can look up the
tail number and see

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.830
to whom it's registered.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.410
Sometimes it's obscured
with a shell LLC somewhere.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.190
But it can be interesting.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.510
This is one of the worst
parts of the FAA and the exam.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.460
They use the words category and
classes in two different ways.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.900
One is for getting your pilot's
certificate, in which case

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.090
a category is something
like airplane or rotorcraft.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.860
And then you have
this class, which

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.500
could be multi engine C in
the case of this Grumman.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.140
I think it might be a
mallard there on the right--

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.730
1940s Grumman seaplane.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.280
So that's a multi
engine C rating

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.730
that you would have in
the airplane category.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.880
Here's your little matrix.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.070
You can study this
from the books.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.280
But you see these are
the different categories

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.110
of aircraft here on the left.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.810
Some of the fun ones like
powered parachute, weight shift

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.440
control.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.800
Fortunately, there
are no flight schools

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.050
for those kind of aircraft
that I know of in the area.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.420
Wouldn't be much fun in
a New England February.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.140
Category, class.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.080
Very exciting.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.980
So just to give you an overview
of the pilot and instructor

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.720
certification.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.970
On the left here, you
have your levels of pilot.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.580
We're concentrating
on private pilot.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.880
Recreational pilot is
extremely unpopular.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.590
Sport pilot-- it's
just a handful

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.320
of schools for that as well.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.910
So really, it's
private, commercial,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.780
ATP are the three core levels
of a pilot certificate.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.390
To those, you add ratings.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.670
So airplane single engine land--

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.950
that lets you fly
the Icon A5 seaplane

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.860
that you might have seen.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.410
And you also need type
ratings for heavier

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.480
or turbo jet powered aircraft.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.790
That means you've had special
training for your DC 3,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.550
which is heavy,
or for your Boeing

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.720
737, which has turbo jets.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.380
The flight instructor has
a separate certificate.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:03.620
And that has its own set of
ratings which are simpler.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.360
So single engine
airplane-- notice

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.040
it doesn't say land or sea.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.750
So I have a commercial
seaplane rating.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.820
And I have an
instructor certificate

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.530
for single engine airplane.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.640
So for anybody who wants
to die by drowning,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.580
I can offer you instruction
in a single engine

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.860
seaplane or a multi engine
seaplane, for that matter.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.980
Although there aren't
too many of those.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.810
There is a totally
separate certificate.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.360
If you are also
passionate about drones,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.290
you'll end up with three
pieces of plastic--

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.040
one for the pilot certification,
one for the instructor,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.980
and one for being
a remote pilot.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.440
So aircraft, they
use the same words

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.050
but to mean different things.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.850
We will have a normal
or utility category

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.980
of aircraft or acrobatic.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.830
Those are the three
that you're going to see

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.560
at your typical flight school.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.810
On the right there is the
GameBird, a very interesting

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.520
plane that I just flew
in Bentonville, Arkansas.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.720
I would encourage you
guys to look that up.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.780
And then you have class.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.520
If you have a really
big helicopter,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.870
it's a transport category
and rotorcraft class.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.020
All right, there
on the right is--

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.830
I think that's a
Pitcairn autogyro.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.370
So that's a rotorcraft
autogyro from the 1930s.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.770
That's a replica
from Oshkosh, which

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.490
we'll hear about at lunchtime.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.740
The bureaucracies.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.830
You have the NTSB, the
National Transportation Safety

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.440
Board-- a little bit
separate from the FAA, which

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.320
is part of the Department
of Transportation.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.100
The structure of regulations--

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.160
the Code of Federal
Regulations is huge.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.640
I think it's doubled in size
in the last 20 years or so.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.060
The FAA is part of
that in title 14.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.930
If you look up the FARs, the
Federal Aviation Regulations,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.000
oftentimes you'll be
directed to a site that

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.800
has the entire electronic
code of federal regulations.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.830
The most relevant parts
for this class are 61--

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.170
what does it mean
to become a pilot?

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.960
And part 91-- what can you do
if you're flying privately?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.900
If you want to have
fun extra knowledge,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.150
these are some of the other
FARs that are occasionally

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.110
worth looking at.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.660
You can look at doing charter
and airline operations.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.420
Those have air
carrier certificates.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.300
And then you add something
for scheduled big airplanes,

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.700
like FAR 121, or smaller
charter airplanes, 135.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.608
If you want to see what
kind of engineering

00:14:48.608 --> 00:14:50.025
you have to
demonstrate to the FAA

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:54.150
to get your product certified,
you can look into, for example,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.260
FAR 27 to see what Robinson
had to do for the R-44

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.760
to show that it was safe.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.020
FAR 61 is about pilots,
flight instructors,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.970
and ground instructors.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.848
The standards are
actually reasonable.

00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:15.890
You have to do a flight
review with an instructor

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.800
every two years in
order to continue

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.550
to exercise the privileges
of your certificate.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.610
If you want to add, for
example, the capability

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.300
to fly in the clouds,
that's the instrument rating

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.010
that Tina was talking about.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:39.170
And that's in FAR 61.65.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.040
Some of these are
just sign-offs.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.800
For high performance
or complex you just

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.728
need an endorsement from an
instructor that you did it.

00:15:45.728 --> 00:15:47.270
For the type ratings,
you'll actually

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.080
get a new pilot certificate
after usually simulator

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.260
training at a simulator center.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.010
All right, so these
are some of the things

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.570
that you need to
know for the test.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.240
Until 9/11, the
pilot certificate

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.520
was a piece of paper, I think.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.900
And the photo ID
was not required.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.550
So you could just go out and
fly with your piece of paper

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.673
and your medical certificate.

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:14.090
Now you don't need
that, actually,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.673
because of this thing
called BasicMed.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.938
You know, I guess, that--

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.980
you have to know, I think,
for some test question

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.040
that they can be inspected
by these various agencies.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.350
All right, drugs and alcohol.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.350
This is actually
one of the worst

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.920
parts of the FAA certification
projects for young people.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.420
People my age, we don't
get invited to parties.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.500
So getting arrested for
DUI is not really an issue.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.980
But I know this guy,
really wonderful young guy,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.130
about 20-- very
enthusiastic, very smart.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.880
He was in college.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.870
He was drinking.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.330
And he got arrested for DUI.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.150
And the FAA treated
him like they would--

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.100
if I were arrested
for DUI, it would

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.020
mean that I was an alcoholic.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.000
But he was not an alcoholic.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.810
But they don't have
different standards.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.140
So they can't just say,
well, he's in college.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.401
So of course, he's drinking.

00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:09.859
They said, well,
he's an alcoholic.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.109
So they wanted him to
do years of proving

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.540
that he went to alcohol
treatment programs and all

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.349
this other stuff.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:21.589
So really, you have
to report any time

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.180
that you have an alcohol
related infraction with a motor

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:24.680
vehicle.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.472
And that's how I would
say this is probably

00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:29.510
the number one reason that
pilots lose their certificates.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.130
Marijuana.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.630
I was just in Haiti actually.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.560
And the shaman was showing--

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.290
not the tourist part
of Haiti, of course,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.540
but the authentic Haiti.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.260
So the shaman was showing us the
50 different medicinal plants

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.540
that they used to
treat various ailments.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.630
And I said, you guys
are so primitive.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.000
In Massachusetts,
we have one plant

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.440
that people say will cure
almost any kind of problem.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.680
And that's medical marijuana.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.510
So you can't really be
a stoner and honestly

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.880
answer the questions on the--

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.190
despite the legality
in Massachusetts,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.890
you can't be a stoner and
hold your pilot certificate.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.150
Because you're supposed to tell
the FAA about your glaucoma

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.430
and how you're treating
it with medical marijuana.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.272
So the certificate
duration is two years

00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:20.230
for flight instructors.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.510
They want us to do
recurrent training

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.480
or sign off so many students
that we don't need it.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.690
For remote pilot, they want you
to pass a test every two years.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.210
The pilot certificate
never expires.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.700
Here's a couple
pictures from last week.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.680
I was out in Sonoma, California.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.980
And I stumbled on
this airport where

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.250
one pilot was flying this
1940s Howard airplane

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.870
that you see on the left.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.560
And another pilot was
flying this P-51 Mustang--

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.790
which on a 2,500 foot runway,
that's a pretty short runway.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.590
And it's very windy, nasty
wind patterns off the bay.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.100
So that's kind of a short runway
for a $3 million airplane.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.220
Those were $1,500, by the way,
when the government sold them

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.740
as surplus at the
end of World War II.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.710
But anyway, those pilot
certificates never expire.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.230
Somebody could not
fly for 30 years,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.720
go out and do a little
bit of recurrent training,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.230
and get signed off by an
instructor for a flight review,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.210
and fly again, assuming--

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.000
I guess he or she would
need to get a renewed

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.830
medical certificate.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.540
For you all, you're going to
have a third class medical

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.698
that'll be valid for five years.

00:19:30.698 --> 00:19:32.240
Everything's based
on calendar month.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.830
So if you get it
on the 1st of June,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.160
it will expire at the end
of June five years later.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.150
Airline pilots need
first class medicals.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.650
The captain needs a first
class medical by regulation.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.080
Might be true of the
first officer too.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.020
Just ordinary charter use or
doing helicopter sightseeing

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.130
or whatever, that's a second
class medical operation.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.850
One reason that people like
sport pilot and glider flying

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.050
is that these medicals
are not required.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.250
So if they think that they
might not pass a medical,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.285
then they'll transition
to one of those.

00:20:08.285 --> 00:20:10.660
I think they say that you have
to have a current driver's

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.160
license.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.020
And it's a little bit
of self reporting.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.430
You have to basically consider
yourself to be healthy.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.770
BasicMed, you start
with the third class

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.090
during your training.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.800
And then you'll go every four
years to a regular doctor.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.160
You can see in FAR 61.113 that
there's a limit to what you

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.270
can do under BasicMed.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.110
You can't fly a
heavy fast airplane

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.810
with a lot of people in it.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.930
OK, for most tests you need an
endorsement from an instructor.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.340
For the checkride
you can pass it.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.400
It can be discontinued--
maybe the weather turned bad.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.490
You can fail, usually
on one or two maneuvers.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.680
You can retake the failed
test, which might only

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.670
be on those one or two maneuvers
at the examiner's discretion.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:06.308
You have to log sufficient
to prove to the FAA

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.350
that you meet currency
requirements-- like you've

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.950
done three takeoffs and
landings within the last 90 days

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.160
if you're carrying passengers,
or that you had a flight

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.360
review within two years.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.180
That's from a-- I have a
nephew in medical school.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.290
So you're supposed to ground
yourself if you get sick.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.600
So you've got a medical
certificate five years ago.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.690
But if you're not fit to fly,
then you ground yourself.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.130
There's a regulation about that.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:40.240
The flight review
requires an hour of ground

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.930
and an hour of
flight at a minimum--

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.470
whatever the instructor thinks
that you need to be safe.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.450
Or if you get a new
pilot's certificate,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.880
for example, because you
got an instrument rating,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.050
then the flight review
is not required.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.590
So oftentimes, people are
enthusiastic about it.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.500
They won't have a flight
review for the first five or 10

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.900
years of their aviation
journey, because they

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.010
keep getting new certificates
for this or that.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.380
The insurance requirements
for more complex aircraft

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.355
usually require training
every 12 months.

00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:11.480
So they essentially are
more stringent than the FAA

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.260
requirements.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.650
So as I mentioned, you need to
have done some recent flying

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.790
by yourself or with
passengers before you

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.920
can take additional passengers.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.810
And if you're going
to carry passengers

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:32.330
at night, which is defined
for this currency as one hour

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.718
after sunset to one
hour before sunrise,

00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:37.760
you have to have done
three takeoffs and landings

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.490
to a full stop before you can
carry passengers at night.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.860
This is the one
where people often

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.650
have trouble maintaining
their currency

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.750
and have to make a special
trip to the airport

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.120
to build currency.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.630
This has to be in category,
class, and type, if applicable.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.440
So if it's a jet, you
have to-- if you're

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.370
typed in a Boeing 737, you have
to have done the three takeoffs

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.610
and landings at night
in your Boeing 737

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.580
to be current to take
more passengers at night.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.998
It's not enough to do
it just in a Cessna 172.

00:23:11.998 --> 00:23:14.290
The flight review, oddly
enough, doesn't work that way.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.970
You can do it in any of the
aircraft for which you're

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.500
rated.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.330
Again, the insurance company
might be stricter about that.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.890
Tell the FAA if you move.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.550
This is packing up for a
recent trip to Florida.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.970
So it sure looked
like we were moving.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.670
Let me tell you, once you have
a light aircraft and a family,

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.150
every trip becomes just like
that movie Sophie's Choice.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.420
You have to decide who or what
is going to be left behind.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.800
It's pretty painful.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.090
OK, student pilot.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.550
Before you can solo, you
pass a little written test

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.540
that's kind of chosen
and given by the CFI.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.660
You have to receive training on
specific listed maneuvers that

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.240
are in this FAR 61.87.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.540
You get signed off
for solo flight.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.890
And that has to be
renewed every 90 days.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:12.400
You can't take passengers or
go above a broken or overcast

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:12.900
layer.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.380
So as unwise as it may sound,
if you're only visually rated

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.440
you can take off, fly over
clouds with the expectation

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.900
that when you get
to your airport,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.400
the weather is
forecast to be clear,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.630
or at least you're
hoping it will be clear.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.980
They won't let you do that
if you're a student pilot.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.100
The CFI may also add
other limitations

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.980
like a maximum
wind, for example.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.320
Each cross-country flight--
so if you're going from,

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.420
for example, Hanscom
Field up to Portland,

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.740
Maine as a solo cross-country
or to Keene, New Hampshire,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.490
that requires that you do the
flight plan and review it with

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.090
the CFI--

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.250
doesn't have to
be a regular CFI.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.780
And have the CFI sign off that
your planning is adequate.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.310
You can, actually,
fly in Bravo airspace.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.780
We'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.470
The most controlled airspace
in the US, basically-- right

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.263
around the biggest airports.

00:25:06.263 --> 00:25:08.430
However, you have to have
a sign-off from the flight

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.270
instructor.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.760
You can actually land at
a class Brave airport.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.550
Salt Lake City has
a flight school.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.170
So they obviously
have people who

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:23.820
are soloing at a huge
commercial airport.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.180
However, in the
FARs, appendix D,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.140
some airports are
excluded from student use

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.990
of the actual runways as
opposed to the airspace.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.840
Logan happens to be one of them.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.090
So once you get your
private pilot certificate,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:39.810
what can you do?

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.400
This is what I like to do.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.560
Fly over Boston.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.150
I've got the family in the back.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.710
We start in the Cirrus.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.690
We end up at Provincetown.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.390
We find the whales by--

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.330
after careful study
of marine biology,

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.010
I've learned that
the best way to find

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.050
whales is to look for
a whale watching boat.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.390
They're just off shore.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.830
It saves, actually,
a lot of time.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.920
It's about 20 minutes to P-town.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.700
And the whale watch cruises
that leave from P-town,

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.210
those are three or four hours.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.710
So this is a very efficient
way to see the whales.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.850
Who is eligible?

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.030
A lot of people solo
on their 16th birthday.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:25.440
And they get a pilot certificate
on their 17th birthday.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.780
You can do it even a little
bit younger, a year younger,

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.780
in gliders and balloons.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.590
You must have that CFI sign-off
to take the practical test,

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.890
pass the knowledge test that's
kind of the end of this course,

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.120
and meet the experience
requirements.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.560
That means at least 40
hours of total time, three

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.640
hours of night, and so forth--

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.530
10 hours of solo.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.890
Flight proficiency.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.750
So this is the stuff that's
in the airman certification

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.200
standards that we talked about.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:04.280
So it says you've got to be
able to fly, power off landing.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.670
You've got to be able to
demonstrate a soft field

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.510
take-off, like how you
would take off if you

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.603
were on grass and so forth.

00:27:12.603 --> 00:27:15.270
Everything's in there, including
some basic instrument training,

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:15.960
actually.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.762
The FAA has three
hours of training.

00:27:17.762 --> 00:27:19.470
And they want you to
demonstrate that you

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.992
can fly by reference to
instruments, at least well

00:27:22.992 --> 00:27:24.450
enough to get back
out of the cloud

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.470
that you inadvertently
flew into.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.380
So as I noted, you need
20 hours of training

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.302
from a CFI minimum,
10 hours solo minimum.

00:27:34.302 --> 00:27:36.010
The other 10 hours is
at your discretion.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.653
Almost all people would choose
to do that with an instructor,

00:27:38.653 --> 00:27:41.070
because it's not a big added
cost compared to the airplane

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.850
rental.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.560
The training from the CFI will
include one long cross-country.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.690
That's kind of the
interesting part.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.850
100 nautical mile cross-country.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.840
I think it has to stop at
three different airports.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.100
So the one you took
off from and two more,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.120
like a triangle flight.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.860
And those three hours
of instrument training I

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.170
told you about and the
three hours of test prep

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.400
within two calendar months.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.860
Oh, yeah.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.520
So actually-- sorry, I was
mistaken about this one.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.870
100 nautical mile
cross-country flight at night

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.860
does not require three legs.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.130
But your solo-- you have to
do one solo 150 nautical mile

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:32.290
trip, three legs of about
50 nautical miles each--

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.150
one at least 50 nautical.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.240
So that's the one
where the FAA thinks,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.700
OK, this person is really
good to go and start

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.930
taking his or her friends.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.680
Which, as I said earlier, you
might think that that might not

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.240
be what the friends want.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.260
You might say, no, I'd rather be
in a five-seat Cirrus with you

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.390
and the more experienced
pilot in the front.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.230
And we'll sit in
the back and party.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:03.140
All right, so this is
a little bit tricky.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.960
But basically, you can fly if
it's part of your business.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.560
So if your company requires
you to get to a meeting,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.650
you can do that with a
private pilot certificate.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.350
Generally, though, you have to
be paying for most of the stuff

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.850
that you do.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.120
You can't let your friends
pay the full cost of renting

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.140
the airplane, for example.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.510
You can tow a glider.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.500
There's kind of elaborate rules
that have gotten more complex

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.590
every year about how
to do charity flights.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.570
But it can be done.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.580
Regulation versus insurance.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.360
So here's a question for you.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.870
What if, hypothetically
speaking, somebody shut down

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.390
the government and
there was no FAA?

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.120
Could this work?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.310
And I think actually it could.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.150
You would just say, it's illegal
to fly without insurance.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.470
Because let's think about it.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.250
The FAA says that you can
go to East Coast Aero Club,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:02.560
fly around in a Piper
Warrior, get your certificate,

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.020
and then just get a couple of
sign-offs from an instructor

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.590
for complex, high performance--
actually, I guess it's three--

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.180
high altitude.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.440
And then at 43 hours
of flight time,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.760
you get yourself into this
$5 million Pilatus PC-12.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.590
You've got the entire family.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.480
You pitch your tent at Oshkosh.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.710
Everybody's happy.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.410
Well, that's legal from
the FAA's point of view.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.300
But the insurance
company says, you know,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.760
we don't really want to
buy you a new Pilatus

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.817
after you go sideways off
the runway at Oshkosh.

00:30:33.817 --> 00:30:35.400
So we're not going
to let you do that.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.775
You don't have
enough experience.

00:30:36.775 --> 00:30:39.190
You're going to need specific
training for the airplane.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.100
Again, this is the single
engine land airplane.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.420
It's not over 12,500 pounds, so
you don't need a type rating.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.568
And therefore, you
could just get in there.

00:30:48.568 --> 00:30:50.110
And most people
don't lock the doors.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.200
So just jump in, push
the start button, and go.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.063
FAA is happy.

00:30:54.063 --> 00:30:55.480
Well, again, the
insurance company

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.770
wouldn't have let you
do that to begin with.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.950
So if this complex
regulatory environment

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.752
didn't exist but
insurance were required,

00:31:02.752 --> 00:31:04.210
I think you'd end
up with something

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.010
that was substantially similar
and basically the same.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.710
The FAA system, I will
say in favor of it,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.010
it's kind of motivational.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.055
It's sort of like the bad
system that the Boy Scouts--

00:31:16.055 --> 00:31:17.680
I guess they're not
Boy Scouts anymore.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.570
The Scouts and the Girl Scouts--

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.260
they're still the Girl Scouts--

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.440
that the Scouts run.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.760
And it motivates people
to get the next one.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.400
Everything except the drones
is hanging off either the pilot

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.860
or the CFI certificate.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.560
And just remember that you're
going to stay FAA current

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.197
by flying every quarter and with
an instructor every two years.

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:41.030
A lot of people in New
England, though, they

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.405
don't fly much
during the winter.

00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:45.470
So they go up and do a currency
flight in the springtime

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.820
before the flying season starts.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.350
So while you're thinking
about your questions,

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.080
about the regulatory
framework or learning to fly,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.580
I'll just show you
a flight that you

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.290
could do with just a private.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.810
There is an entangled
whale in New York Harbor

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.910
with fishing gear all over him.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.320
And the people that
could untangle him

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.620
were in Provincetown.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.570
So Noah asked me to volunteer,
because they had my email

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.730
from the sea turtle flights.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.370
They said, hey, would you
mind flying over Boston,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.710
picking these guys
up in Provincetown,

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:24.170
going over New York Harbor in
the area just outside of it

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.700
to look for the whale, land
them on the New Jersey Shore,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.710
so they can get
into a zodiac boat

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.947
and chase after the whales?

00:32:32.947 --> 00:32:35.030
They didn't tell me to go
visit my parents in D.C.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.030
but I did while they were
out chasing the whale.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.030
And then come back.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.910
And I dropped them off,
I think, right-- just

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.420
after sunset I landed at
Provincetown after sunset.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.900
And then I did a night
flight over water

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.400
in a single engine
plane that's about to--

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.500
it's just reached its 2,000
hour overhaul for the engine.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.430
So maybe that wasn't
the wisest thing to do.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:03.600
But I do have a life
jacket and a raft.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.060
So that was an entire day
of flying from about 7:00 AM

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.900
to about--

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.120
I don't know-- 9:00 PM when
I landed back in Hanscom.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.770
And I think that
didn't require more

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.680
than a private certificate,
because it's all volunteer.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.690
People say, have you
ever been scared?

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.670
Philip, you've
flown 4,000 hours.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.920
What's the scariest thing
that's ever happened to you?

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.320
And I think actually
it was on this flight.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.440
Because if you see,
there's that IFR.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:33.170
That's an IFR intersection
that the FAA came up with.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.095
So for those of you who
are familiar with Judaism,

00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:39.470
you will know that is not
something you ever want to see.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.120
All right, so who has a
question about that material?

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.410
Or should we zip into systems?

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.120
AUDIENCE: Are there
any medical conditions

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.593
that would prohibit you
from flying altogether?

00:33:51.593 --> 00:33:53.010
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
The question is,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.090
are there any medical
conditions that really preclude

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.010
a person from getting
a pilot's certificate

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.260
or getting the medical to
go with a pilot certificate?

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.885
I guess you need the
medical to get it,

00:34:01.885 --> 00:34:03.140
because you need to solo.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.413
The FAA-- they have
an exemption process.

00:34:07.413 --> 00:34:08.830
And they have their
own physicians

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.389
in Oklahoma City that review.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.810
So usually you can work with
an aviation medical examiner

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.810
and get some kind of exception.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.409
Diabetics, they're kind
of concerned about.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.400
But if the person has a long
history of controlling it well,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.080
they'll usually
give an exemption.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.790
People have heart bypasses.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.940
And then they have to go through
some rehabilitation process

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.980
that makes the FAA happy.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.880
So it's all laid out.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.130
There's a lot of stuff
online about the standards

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.739
that they use.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.614
And it's complicated.

00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.040
But the doctors-- there's a
lot of good local aviation

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.540
examiners.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.280
One of them works right
at Cambridge hospital.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.789
So that's a fairly easy
question to get answered.

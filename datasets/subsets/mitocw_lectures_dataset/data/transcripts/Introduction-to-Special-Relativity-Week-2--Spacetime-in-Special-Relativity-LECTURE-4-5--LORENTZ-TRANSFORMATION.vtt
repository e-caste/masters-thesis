00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:09.610
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.370
In this section, we want to
discuss Lorentz transformation.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.360
Or, in other words, given
an event observed by Bob,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.840
we want to express that
event as observed by Alice.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.810
We want to find the translation
between the observations

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.180
in Bob's reference
frames to the observation

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.220
in Alice's reference frames.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.770
We have already done
this for the classic case

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.490
as Galilean transformation.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.430
Now, we want to do
this in the framework

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.590
of special relativity.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.170
In order to simplify
the discussion,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.260
we don't worry about the
y- and z-component here.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.330
Those dimensions
can be neglected

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.080
if we assume that the relative
motion between the two

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.810
reference frames
only in x-direction.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.000
We also know from the
previous discussion

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.910
that you can use the
invariant interval.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.710
ct squared minus x squared
is the same observed in Bob's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.450
and in Alice's reference frame.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.450
We'll make use of this fact.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.440
And, lastly, we can assume
that this transformation

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.210
has to be linear.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.930
Why?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.700
Because we transform something
like a measurement of distance

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.250
into a measurement of distance.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.510
It has to be linear.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.900
If not, we find something
like a length squared

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.160
or the same for time.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.200
And we might end
up on time squared

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.543
if we don't do this correctly.

00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:33.960
All right, so we can write
this down as a linear equation,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.700
which is a multiplication of
a matrix with a vector, ct, x,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.480
into a vector, ct [? x ?]
[? prime, ?] x prime.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.970
OK, so the goal
here now is to find

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.690
the parameters or the
coefficients of this matrix,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.670
OK?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.990
I invite you to stop the video
here and try to work it out.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.970
It's an interesting exercise.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.190
It tests your algebra knowledge.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.780
There's not much
physics in here,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.130
but it's still useful to go
along and try to work this out.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.580
So the first thing
we want to do is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.320
assume that the origins
coincide at t equals 0.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.950
And then we can follow along
the trajectory of the origin

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.770
of S prime in the S frame.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.870
So this is just ct, vt.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.860
OK, great.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.770
This already gives us a
constraint on the coefficients

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.200
a1,0 over a1,1, which is
equal to minus v/c, OK?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.060
And then we can use
the invariant interval,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.280
which is another constraint.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
And we can use this to obtain
the set of equations here.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.010
I will not read this for you.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.690
And that's already
enough in order

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.640
to solve the set of equations.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.850
So, if you do this
and follow along,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.760
you find answers for
all four coefficients

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.480
given gamma and beta as
we defined them before.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.480
This then simplifies to
our Lorentz transformation.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.130
So the only thing we did here
is we simplified a little bit.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.400
We assumed that this is
a linear transformation.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.470
We used the invariant
interval in order

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.900
to set the constraints.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.720
And we find Lorentz
transformation.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.610
If I summarize this,
we find this matrix

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.300
here with coefficients gamma,
minus gamma beta, minus gamma

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.070
beta, and gamma.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.895
Great.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.550
Or, if you want,
you can write this

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.550
as an equation for the
spatial component and the time

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.300
component.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300
So does this make sense?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.970
There's always a chance
that we make a mistake

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.330
in this kind of calculation.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.860
So we want to make sure that
the answers we developed

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.080
in previous sections
actually are reflected

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.830
by this transformation.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.910
So let's go one by one.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.380
The first thing we
can do is check units.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.110
If we do that, we see that
this first equation here

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.800
is of unit meter, and then we
can analyze the second part

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.770
of the equation.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.910
OK, so gamma is unitless.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.140
x is of unit meter.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.540
And then we have beta ct.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.740
Beta is unitless.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.520
c is meter per second times
second, also of unit meter.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.350
So this checks out.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.420
The second equation
is very similar.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.880
c times t is of unit meter.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.240
Meter per second times
second is of unit meter.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.560
Gamma is unitless.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.610
Beta is unitless.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.270
And then we have an x,
unit [? meter, ?] plus ct,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.810
c, meter per second
times second, also meter.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.887
So this checks out.

00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:35.595
So this is great.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.820
At least we find that we
have a linear transformation

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.890
by design, and the
units work out.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.890
So now we can see,
what happens now

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.960
if we use this for
velocities which

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.300
are much, much smaller
than the speed of light?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.490
In this case, gamma is equal to
0, and beta is very close to 0.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.900
If we put this in our
equations, you find x prime

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.790
is equal x minus vt.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.310
And t prime is equal to t.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.160
OK, this checks out because this
is our Galilean transformation.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.920
So, for systems
which move relative

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.290
with very low difference
in velocities,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.360
we can use Galilean
transformation

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.710
as an approximation of
Lorentz transformation.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.260
OK, at a third part, now we
can investigate a little bit

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.120
further.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.170
For example, what happens
now to a distance,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.210
just a measure of
distance or a measure

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.270
of length, which
we obtain by making

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.760
this measurement simultaneously
at t2 equal to t2?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.930
We find delta x prime is
equal to gamma delta x.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.270
All right, that's
length contraction.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.340
If we do the same
thing for delta t,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.280
for doing the
measurement of time

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.180
at x equals-- x2 equals
x1, we find time dilation.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.613
All right, this is
exactly what we expect.

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:01.280
And then we can look
at two events which

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.630
happen at the same
time in frame S

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.400
and see what
happens to the time,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.860
as measured in system S prime.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.770
Delta t prime is equal
to gamma delta t.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.420
Well, in this example,
we set this to 0.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.420
And then we have the
second term, which is minus

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.490
beta over c gamma delta x.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.420
So we find that, while this
event happened simultaneously

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.070
in our frame S1--

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.580
or in S, it does not
happen simultaneously

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.160
in our frame S prime.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.370
There's an extra
term, which is not 0

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.512
unless you actually measure
at the very same point,

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:38.890
l is equal to 0.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.250
So this is the relativity
of simultaneity.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.200
Again, this checks out.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.150
And I think we're good with
our Lorentz transformation.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.770
DUANE BONING: The first
problem set is out,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.890
and I should let you know
that Hayden is watching out

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.010
for you, because we
actually trimmed off one

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.470
problem from past problem sets.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.000
So this is a little bit
of a revamp from the past,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160
and slightly shorter.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.530
So the trade-off is maybe
asking slightly fewer questions,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.600
but then emphasizing
a little bit

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.120
more the discussive responses
from you on the problem set.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.710
As we talked about
last time, we'd

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.970
really like a little bit
of textual description

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.960
from you about the problem
and your thought processes

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.730
on those.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.600
OK, good-- so let's
start with today.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.802
If you recall, Tuesday
was the broad overview,

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:21.260
a little bit of
the outline of what

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.360
we're going to be seeing
throughout the course

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.620
of the semester.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.070
Today I'm going to focus in
a little bit on semiconductor

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.390
process technology, but with
a real emphasis on variation

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.460
in semiconductor processes.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.750
And the basic agenda here
is give you a very quick--

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.120
I think it's a four-slide
process summary

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.980
of a typical process sequence.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.680
It's going to be a bit stylized.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.030
Another reading
assignment that is coming,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.000
but I have not quite
issued yet in order

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.110
to give you some room to work on
problem set 1, will be chapter

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.280
2 of May and Spanos, which is a
fairly nice condensed, but good

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
enough depth and detail
description of semiconductor

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.690
process technology.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
So it is an excellent
50-page, 30 to--

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.025
well, I guess chapter 2 is
about something like 50 pages--

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.740
nice introduction
to and some details

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.308
on semiconductor processing.

00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:33.600
But what I want to do is set
a little bit of a baseline

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.690
to make sure everybody has
a course picture of what

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.880
is involved in making
integrated circuits,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.090
since that is going to
be one of the processes

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.770
that we use to illustrate
lots of things.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.030
And so what I'm going to talk a
little bit about after going--

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.400
flying through the
whole process sequence

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.870
is some of the
types of variation

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
that arise in
microfabrication, with emphasis

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.030
on parametric variation.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.780
And then we'll talk a little
bit about temporal variation--

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.920
run to run, wafer to
wafer, if you will--

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.260
and then spatial variations.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.440
And semiconductor processing
is an interesting one,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.860
because there are
nesting of replication

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.240
of the products within
additional geometric

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.970
structures.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.180
So we'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.650
And then what we'll be doing
mixed in with the discussion

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.530
of these types of
variation is trying

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.800
to give you a little bit of a
preview, some examples drawn

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.360
from both the literature
and some of the research

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.145
that my group has been doing
over the last 10 years or so.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:43.770
We'll try to give
you a preview of some

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.110
of the kinds of manufacturing
control techniques

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.090
that we'll be diving
in much more detail

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.360
throughout the term.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.390
So we'll see a
little bit early on

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.960
about basic statistical
analysis, trying to decide,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.410
is there something
varying here or not--

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.410
basic detection and
analysis of that.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.960
Then we'll talk a little
bit about process modeling,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.150
especially from an
empirical point of view,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.500
and a little bit of the boundary
between physical modeling

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.180
and empirical modeling.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.350
I'll give you a little
example of that.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.620
And then we'll talk about
using those kinds of models

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.279
for process optimization and
some of the kinds of strategies

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.640
that arise to have
robust designs--

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.480
and then lastly, a very
simple example of feedback

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.400
control in a unit process in
semiconductor fabrication.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.890
So the following is from a book.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.890
It's a little bit dated.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.810
About 10 years old.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.460
It's actually an
interesting book,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.410
because it's about
statistical case

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.290
studies in industrial
process improvement, where

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.450
almost all of the
cases are really

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.740
drawn from the
semiconductor industry.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.630
So before they dive into
those statistical methods,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.630
they themselves give
a very quick overview

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.950
of the semiconductor
fabrication process.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.490
So I like this example or this--

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.310
I think there's three or four
slides that have a sequence--

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.330
a little bit because it's fairly
simplified and abstracted,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.170
so we can go through it quickly.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.480
But the real reason I love this
is there are mistakes in it.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.680
There are errors, things
that don't necessarily make

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.540
physical sense or don't quite--

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.030
well, a lot of
this is, of course,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.300
simplification of the process
to get it down to something

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.010
easy, but even in that--

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.350
with that caveat,
there's things that

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.270
are just-- don't quite line up.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.640
So your challenge is to
try to point out to me,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.280
as we go through it,
what can't be right--

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.310
even if you don't have a lot
of semiconductor background.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.810
So let's see if you
can catch these.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.485
Actually, let's see if I
can skip ahead briefly.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.500
I'm skipping to the
end of the sequence.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.240
This is step 25.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.290
What we're showing here is
the fabrication sequence

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.440
of building up thin films
on the surface of the wafer,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.730
as well as changing the
material properties of parts

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.510
of the surface of the
wafer, scoped in or zoomed

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.860
in to trying to build
a single transistor.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.280
Now, there are people that build
and sell single transistors,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.680
but really we're talking
integrated circuits.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.390
At the ICC Conference
earlier this week,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.240
Intel announced their 2 billion
transistor microprocessor.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.910
So that's the level
of integration

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.110
that's out there now.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.090
We're going to focus on one.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.940
Clearly, when we talk
a little bit later,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.800
part of the challenge is to
build a product with 2 billion

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.030
of these things and
have them all work.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.580
So this is a wonderful
industry in terms

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.330
of exquisite manufacturing
control required

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.280
to have all 2 billion
things work on your circuit.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.920
But to get a picture of
what's really going on,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.870
we're going to focus in
on a single transistor.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.390
And there's a picture
of it geometrically,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.530
and over on the right here
is a very abstracted picture

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.430
of the function of a
single MOSFET transistor.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.620
And the basic idea
is that this can

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.290
act as an electronic switch
under the application

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.190
of different voltage
conditions so that one

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.210
can control the flow of current
in an on/off kind of fashion,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.150
and therefore perform
certain logic functions,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.140
depending on the presence
or absence of voltage

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.420
on components of the structure.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.510
The real action
is, right down here

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.650
in the center of the device, in
the center of the transistor,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.470
you essentially have
a source and a drain.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.500
These are electrically
conductive,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.290
and these little blue
things are, in this picture,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.990
aluminum paths or metal paths--

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.450
metal connections, if you will--

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:33.630
that make contact to
the semiconductor--

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.610
the silicon semiconductor
layer underneath.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.400
These red regions have
been very highly doped--

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.110
and we'll see the
process for doing

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:49.210
that-- that make them also
much more metallic in nature.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.300
They are highly conductive.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.600
So this is how we
get electrical access

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.430
down to the semiconductor.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.060
The interesting
part is the silicon

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.520
that has been only
lightly doped--

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.130
and that's what I think
these little dots are meant

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.340
to indicate-- to control the
degree at which it will conduct

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.980
under different amounts
of potential applied

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.790
to it from the
control of a gate.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.870
This blue-- I guess it's
green on this picture--

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.420
this is the gate electrode.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.960
And eventually, it's typically
made out of polysilicon,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.290
and eventually
contacted also by metal

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.990
so that we can apply positive
or negative voltage to the gate.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.355
And if we apply in a
typical NMOS transistor

00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:46.380
enough of a positive
voltage, what

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.710
we do is we attract lots
and lots of negative charges

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.880
to counteract the
positive charges

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.450
we're creating on the
surface of the gate.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.460
We create lots of--

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.130
or attract or
generate an inversion

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.680
with lots and lots of
electrons, negative charge

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.050
down here in this
very, very thin surface

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.090
layer of the silicon.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.360
So the semiconducting
silicon can

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.710
be made to conduct under certain
voltage or bias conditions,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.770
and now current can
flow from the gate--

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.810
or underneath the gate from
the source to the drain.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.190
So if we apply a positive
voltage, we turn the thing on,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.790
and current can flow.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:38.400
Alternatively, if we apply
either an opposite voltage,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.300
or no voltage in a typical
MOSFET for logic operations,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.280
the conductivity of
the silicon layer

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.430
will be so low that current is
blocked, and the thing is off.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.170
So the basic idea here is
we need to control carefully

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.910
the conditions and properties
of the silicon layer,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.190
and then we need to set up
the rest of the geometry

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.950
to be able to have
access to the--

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.630
and form the structures for
the source drain and the gate.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.660
So what we're going to
see in this sequence

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.880
is how we start from
some raw material,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.930
build up the thin film
layers, and differentiate

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.610
both the geometry and
change those properties.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.270
So in this picture,
we're starting out here

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.050
with the silicon in white.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:38.310
We add or create a thin
layer of silicon dioxide

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.200
in this picture.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.520
Now, there's lots of
different processes--

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.540
many of these are discussed in
more detail in May and Spanos--

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.920
for creating silicon dioxide.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.360
One is deposit on the surface.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.030
The other is to actually, quote,
"grow" a silicon dioxide layer.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.630
And that is, we essentially
subject the wafer

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:12.570
to an oxygen carrying ambient,
either O2 or a H2O vapor

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.760
kind of ambient.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.710
And the oxygen will react with
the silicon, forming SiO2,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.940
and we have a very nice
stable silicon dioxide layer.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.800
It turns out that
that simple process

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.840
of being able to grow a very
high-quality silicon dioxide

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.780
layer was kind of
the crux process

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.870
that enabled integrated
circuits in some fashion.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.750
And we'll talk about it a
little bit later, but basically,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.730
we're going to need
insulating layers

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.100
between conducting layers--

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.560
one conducting layer
being the silicon itself.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.400
The others-- when we build
multiple levels of wiring,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.660
we need insulators between them.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.280
But in particular, for the
formation of that transistor,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.110
the creation of a very
good high-quality,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.280
very stable,
well-controlled oxide

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.370
insulating layer between the
gate electrode and the silicon

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.740
electrode was crucial.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:20.320
That forms, basically, a metal
gate oxide semiconductor,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.210
or MOS transistor structure.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.730
The ability to create
a MOS capacitor

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.790
and then contact it
on the sides, where

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:38.910
you can invert the silicon
layer was a big challenge.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:45.370
The first transistors were,
in fact, bipolar transistors.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.970
Shortly after the invention
of the bipolar transistor,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.940
Shockley went off on his
own, and also invented

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.230
the MOS transistor.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:01.720
In the very early versions,
a different semiconductor

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.940
material was used--

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.530
different element than silicon.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.505
Anybody know?

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:09.380
What were the first
transistors built out of?

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.255
AUDIENCE: Germanium--

00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:12.730
DUANE BONING:
Germanium-- why aren't

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.720
all of our transistors
built out of germanium now?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720
We'll come back to that.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.303
Some of them are
starting to be again.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.890
The problem is, if
you oxidize germanium,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.390
you get an insulating layer.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.770
The problem is it's
extremely soft and unstable.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.550
And in fact, if you oxidize
the surface of germanium,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.870
you can wipe away the oxide.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.370
It is not stable
and manufacturable.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.980
And so it was
really this ability

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:55.310
right here to be able to grow a
very hard, high-quality silicon

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.300
dioxide that was crucial
for being able to build up

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.940
for both the conversion
over to silicon

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.120
and for being able to build
up complex structures.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.730
OK, so we've got this thin
silicon dioxide layer here

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.200
that has been grown.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.960
Now what we want to
do is start building

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.520
the region where
we're actually going

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.425
to have the active device.

00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:22.050
So we're going to go
through a sequence

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.140
here that gets repeated
again and again this

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.760
is referred to as the
photolithographic sequence.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.890
And so what we start
with is depositing

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.710
a thin layer of photoresist,
shown in red here,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.210
this is typically spun on.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:42.000
So this is a polymer
type of material.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.150
It's in a solvent so that
one can drop the material on,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.150
and then spin the wafer
very rapidly in order

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.730
to get the controlled
film thickness that one

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.010
wants for the photoresist.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:02.220
And this is--
interacts with light

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.180
in one two different ways.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.930
You can have positive
or negative photoresist.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.520
What's shown in the next
picture is a typical--

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.910
let's see.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.230
Is this is one
positive or negative?

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.940
This one's a
positive photoresist,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:28.060
because we're going to basically
transform or imprint, if you

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.710
will, the mask layer
here in the same fashion

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.060
with the underlying photoresist.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.710
The basic idea of
the photoresist

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.710
is it contains
photoactive compounds

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.190
that underexposure to light
will change the polymer

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.625
linking of the photoresist.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:50.164
Yeah-- question?

00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:53.270
AUDIENCE: But I understand
the [INAUDIBLE] sorry.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.020
DUANE BONING: Yes.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.530
AUDIENCE: I understand
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.915
as the [INAUDIBLE]
the black part.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:57.860
DUANE BONING: Right.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
black part.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.130
DUANE BONING: That's
exactly right.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.880
AUDIENCE: --change the
chemical structure.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.359
DUANE BONING: That's right.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:11.240
The goal is to take some
design, from some CAD system

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.660
or whatever, that enables us
to differentiate the surface.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.500
The design is used
to make a physical--

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.680
well, in most cases, a physical
glass plate, if you will,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.010
that has metal blocking areas--

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.540
the chromium-- that
are intended to block

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.600
the transmission of the
light source in some regions,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.780
and allow it in others.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.250
So that's exactly right.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.468
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
are not exposed.

00:17:38.468 --> 00:17:39.260
DUANE BONING: Yeah.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.690
So this is actually a cutaway.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.850
This is going on for--

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.660
if this is only a
couple of microns

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.810
wide, the entire wafer--

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.920
or the entire chip, depending
on how the photolithography--

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.690
it goes on forever.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.490
So this is just a cutaway.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.540
AUDIENCE: No, but I mean
the middle is exposed.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.570
DUANE BONING: Yes, yes.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.685
AUDIENCE: OK, so we can
wash away the exposed part?

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:06.560
DUANE BONING: Right--

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.320
AUDIENCE: But it's
not solidifying the--

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.610
DUANE BONING: No.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:16.290
OK, so that's the two types
of photoresist activity.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.950
So in this case, with the
positive photoresist, what

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:26.240
happens is the light energy
from the exposure system

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.230
will break down some
of the polymer chains

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.380
in the-- in these
photoactive polymer chains

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.260
in the photoresist,
weakening them.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:42.470
We then go in and do a develop
process, where a chemical

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.820
solvent is used that attacks
the weakened polymer chains

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.110
and rinses it away.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.380
So we have the
spin on resist, we

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.630
do the exposure to light through
the mask, then we do a develop,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.250
rinsing away the resist.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.230
And in the positive case,
the pattern on the mask

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.920
is transferred
directly, if you will,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.160
into the pattern
of the photoresist.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.385
There is also, in fact
more commonly used,

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:15.890
a negative photoresist
that actually

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.730
works in the opposite
way, which is anywhere

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.640
where the light
exposes, it actually

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.620
strengthens the chemical bonding
of the photoactive compound

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.510
in the polymer, and makes it
more resistant to dissolution

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.850
in the developer--
in which case,

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.040
I would rinse away
everything that

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.280
did not get exposed and
leave the pattern which

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.980
did get exposed.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.790
So actually, there's some
degree of design choice

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.660
in picking a positive and
negative photoresist, depending

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.980
on some manufacturing
control issues.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:02.770
It turns out, if you're
developing away material,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.320
you might, in one
case or the other,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.130
be able to actually
overdevelop or overexpose

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.415
slightly and control
slightly the line

00:20:12.415 --> 00:20:14.900
width of these features
a little bit better

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.445
in one photoresist
case than the other,

00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:18.820
depending on what
you want to do.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.610
OK, so so far, this
sequence of three steps

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.540
has simply transferred
the mask pattern

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.050
into a photoresist pattern,
but the photoresist

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.020
itself only temporary.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:41.290
Its purpose is to act as a mask
to allow us to differentiate

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.230
more aggressive
physical transformations

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.970
of the remaining wafer.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.700
And in particular, in
the following case,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.810
as shown here in step
5, this is saying

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.480
what we want to do now is do
another etch of the silicon

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.440
dioxide layer, in
this case using

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.290
a plasma-- a gas plasma etch.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:10.070
I guess that's what the little
lightning storm here is.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:20.800
So this is typically done in
a very low pressure vacuum

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.020
equipment, where we
have some feed gas.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.990
We apply RF energy to dissociate
the species in the gas.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.690
Many of those species then
become very highly chemically

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.540
reactive, and they interact
with the surface of the wafer

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.360
and etch away
particular species.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.460
So one would design
the plasma process

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.400
to preferentially etch away
the silicon dioxide, while not

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.470
attacking, or only
very, very slowly

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.080
attacking the protective
photoresist layer.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.930
So what this is
allowing us to do

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.270
is essentially
vertically etch down

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.450
into the silicon dioxide layer.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.240
Now, in this picture, what
they're trying to do here

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.210
is show that we are partially
etching some silicon dioxide

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:17.290
layer away, apparently leaving
a small remaining level or layer

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.590
of silicon dioxide.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.460
So you can see that
shadow down in there?

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.950
What they're trying
to show in this case

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.760
is they're leaving this
thin silicon dioxide

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.670
layer that is going to be that
insulator between the gate

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.650
electrode and the silicon
that we talked about

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.570
in the final structure.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:42.340
So typically, this
might be, oh--

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.910
what you might have is
close to modern technology.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.560
You might have a 1/2
a micron in the--

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.220
of silicon dioxide
that you want--

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.590
fairly thick silicon dioxide--

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:58.330
out here to act as a very, very
big insulating layer separating

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.540
your metal electrodes
from other components.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.170
But this silicon
dioxide layer that's

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.710
used between the gate
and the semiconductor

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.450
needs to be extremely thin.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.360
And the reason is
the closer I can

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.420
get my two plates of that
capacitor, the more control--

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.010
well, the more
capacitance I have,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:25.190
but the more control I have
all of the silicon surface.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.490
So the harder I can turn the
device on, the more current

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.300
I can flow per unit
area, and so on.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.040
So in this process,
apparently we're

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.390
etching from about 1/2 micron--

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.960
5,000 angstroms-- down to--

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.240
we might be at 100 angstrom.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.055
Or below remaining gate oxide
layer is, in a modern process,

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:50.930
really what you want.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.960
Everybody happy with that?

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.820
AUDIENCE: So what
is the tolerance?

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.500
DUANE BONING: Hooray--
how would you do that?

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.680
Yeah.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.880
What is the tolerance?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.430
Well, first off, to
answer your question,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.990
you want that to be 100
angstroms, plus or minus--

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.710
well, in fact, some of the
kinds of control that they quote

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.060
are plus or minus
5 angstroms, which

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:29.210
is less than an atomic
layer in some cases.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.300
What they actually
mean is, on average,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.710
over certain kinds of areas.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.420
But how would you
actually achieve

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.440
that with the
manufacturing process?

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.260
How are you going to etch
down through 5,000 angstroms

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.860
and stop 1,000 angstroms,
or 100 angstroms

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.080
before you hit the silicon?

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.574
Very carefully-- no, the
answer is you're not.

00:25:02.574 --> 00:25:03.420
You're not.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.340
There are some
additional reasons

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.760
why one wouldn't want to
do it, but at present, we

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.710
don't have the
observability to be

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.610
able to know when we're
within 100 angstroms.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.910
Second, there's no way
you can be that uniform

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.680
across the whole wafer.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.140
What if, on one
part of the wafer,

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.040
instead of 5,000 angstroms,
it was 5,001 angstroms?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.410
By the time I get down to
know etching 4,900 angstroms

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.770
everywhere, that
little 1 out of 5,000

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.980
controllability has been trans--

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.210
or variability,
which is not bad.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:52.566
That'd be great if I got
whatever that percentage is--

00:25:52.566 --> 00:25:54.120
0.02% or whatever.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.290
That's amazing.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.500
But it would magnify by
the time I etch down,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.140
even if I could
etch uniformally.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.850
There's just no way,
most importantly,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.110
to be able to know when
you're within 100 angstroms

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.220
and be able to stop
controllably at that level.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.282
So what do you think
they really do?

00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.740
AUDIENCE: Etch all
the way through,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.210
then grow another layer--

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.140
DUANE BONING: That's
exactly right.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.350
We can controllably
etch all the way

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.300
through using ideas
of etch selectivity.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.920
The same idea I mentioned of--

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.350
we can form the--

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.900
or choose an etch
chemistry that allows

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:39.300
us to etch silicon dioxide
and not etch photoresist.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.310
We can also use to etch silicon
dioxide but not etch silicon,

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.790
can have very good
selectivity so that one

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.210
can stop controllably on
the surface of the silicon.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.310
Now everybody
knows exactly where

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.590
they are across every
place in the wafer.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.910
One can even over-etch
a little bit.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.520
You don't even have to try
to set up a timed etch.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.610
If I was etching at
1,000 angstroms a minute

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.440
and I started with
5,000 angstroms,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.720
I might etch for five minutes.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.500
But to be sure that I've got
the same degree of uniformity

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.710
everywhere, I might add
for an extra 10 seconds.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.410
That way, I'm sure that I'm
clearing everywhere across

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.410
the wafer, even if there's
spatial non-uniformity

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.460
in my etch, or today's
etching's slightly slower than

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.860
yesterday's.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.960
Then I can go back in and, with
different process conditions--

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.580
lower temperatures,
more pure chemicals,

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.270
or slightly different--
primarily different

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.540
temperature, or even
using alternative process

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:54.310
technologies that involve very,
very short time oxidations--

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.890
rapid thermal oxidations--

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.840
I can now controllably grow
up 1,000 angstroms, or 100

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.280
angstroms, or whatever I need.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.580
So that's the first mistake.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.720
I remember that one.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.690
I think there's
another one someplace.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.520
OK.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.560
So still taking
this at face value,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.410
we had the
photolithographic sequence

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.090
imprinted onto the photoresist.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.660
We used that then to
controllability change

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.570
the permanent structure,
the silicon dioxide.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.900
And then we remove using
another chemical solvent,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.040
or in many cases, another
plasma etch, a plasma ash

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.260
that removes the
temporary photoresist.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.130
Then we go on.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.540
We've done that sequence.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.040
We've now deposited
or grown, and then

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.190
spatially differentiated
to be able to create

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.960
one level of the structure.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.440
And now we're going to
repeat that kind of idea

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.590
multiple times, and then mix in
a few additional transformation

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.430
steps.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.170
Next step here as
we're depositing a--

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.640
our polysilicon layer.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.460
Again, this will be fairly
highly doped either subsequent

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.430
to the deposition or
during the deposition.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:22.170
It is a semiconducting layer,
but if one dops it-- that is,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.400
adds elemental impurities of
a particular type to play with

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.950
the band structure
of the silicon--

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.580
one can make that behave in
a fairly metallic fashion.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.550
And in the MOS transistor,
that polysilicon

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:42.400
is very highly doped, and is a
conductor under all conditions.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.730
So we've deposited that.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.490
What geometry do we want?

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.880
We want this thin
gate electrode,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.420
so we're going to
do a photoresist--

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.270
or photolithographic
step again to do that--

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.860
deposit photoresist, expose.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.830
In this case, here, again,
another positive photoresist

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.530
case-- so we're
blocking this structure.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:15.810
We develop and dissolve away
the exposed photoresist,

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.270
and then we're doing a
plasma etch again to--

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.120
plasma etch to form
the gate electrode,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.010
and then remove or ash
away the photoresist.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.810
Now, this structure right
here is very, very critical.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.740
This is the gate electrode.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.750
Again, the current
is going to flow

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.460
in this direction along this
length underneath that gate

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.330
electrode in the silicon.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.110
And this is referred to
as the channel length.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.030
So the channel is the
structure that we're

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.370
going to create
underneath the silicon.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.790
And the length of that
physical electrode

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.470
is very, very, very
critical in determining

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.930
many of the most
important characteristics

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.810
of the transistor.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.690
You can think of it as--

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.510
and we're actually getting
closer in the dimensions

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.130
that we're talking about now--

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.850
that the time of
flight of an electron

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.910
underneath that
electrode will depend

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:26.070
on the width or the length
that it needs to transit.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.100
We're getting close
to these velocity

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.530
limited transport regimes.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:35.520
And so from one point
of view, the ability

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.640
or the speed of
the transistor is

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.550
critically dependent on
variations in that channel

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.850
length.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.240
This is often referred
to as the CD of--

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.290
or one of the CDs of the
process, critical dimensions

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.390
of the process.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.160
And in modern
technology, in fact,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.880
that is perhaps the
smallest lateral dimension

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.520
that is determinative of the
generation of the technology

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.340
and the performance
and characteristics

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.700
of the technology.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.110
So if we talk about a
65-nanometer technology,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.590
they're talking typically
about that channel length,

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:23.950
that minimum feature
size being 65 nanometers.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.400
In fact, often, tricks
are played where,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.660
photolithographically, using the
exposure, that's the dimension

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.340
that they can form.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.610
But you might actually
over-etch and shrink that,

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.255
get that to even a smaller
dimension than you could

00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:44.980
photolithographically define
in order to boost the speed

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.830
and the controllability
of the device.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:56.020
So this is very critical
lithography step and sequence.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.670
Going on, the next
thing we need to do

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.580
is start to form the
source and drain regions.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.370
We need to differentiate
the silicon underneath.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:08.770
And what we're going to do here
is use another process, an ion

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:13.260
implantation process,
I believe, in this--

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.920
yes, I think that's what their
little picture there is--

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.100
where we actually implant
those [INAUDIBLE] atoms.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:27.570
We shoot them with essentially
a high-energy electron or ion

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.860
gun into the silicon in a
very controlled fashion.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.250
The guys who are
going to Varian here

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:40.230
in Gloucester, Massachusetts--

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.450
Varian sells ion implanters.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.410
That's their business.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.760
They're-- I don't know--

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.340
75% or something
of the market now.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.460
They're dominant, and
they sell the equipment

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.764
for ion implantation.

00:33:54.764 --> 00:33:57.940
There's also other competing
ion implant companies,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.990
but most of them are
also in Massachusetts.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.720
So Massachusetts is the ion
implant capital of the world.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.060
The basic idea there,
again, is we're

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:13.120
highly doping in a controllable
fashion just these regions.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.940
Those regions we don't want to
dope underneath the channel--

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.489
we want to keep
that fairly lightly

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:21.880
doped so that we can invert
it for electrical action.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.750
And in this case, we're getting
something often referred

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:31.330
to as a self-aligned
process, whereby

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.630
we don't have to selectively
shoot the ions just in here.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.260
We can blanket the whole wafer,
and use these thick oxide

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.949
and use the polysilicon
as the mask itself

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:46.690
to prevent the ions from
reaching the underlying silicon

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.710
regions.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.060
So instead of having to put
down another photoresist layer

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.770
and try to open up just
exactly those regions,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.400
and worry about aligning
of the physical mask

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.520
to match up exactly
with the existing

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.010
structures on the
wafer, we can take

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.290
advantage of the
underlying structures

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:12.770
to achieve that
spatial alignment.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.270
Yeah?

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.937
AUDIENCE: Can you
elaborate a little bit

00:35:14.937 --> 00:35:18.260
on the process of
placing this photoresist?

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.210
Seems like you're going to have
one [INAUDIBLE] put another.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.340
How do you make sure
everything lines up the way

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.510
you need it to?

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.390
DUANE BONING: This is a
wonderful manufacturing control

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.520
challenge.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.395
Overlay and alignment are--

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:40.540
almost more so than the physical
dimension that can be imaged

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.720
are the manufacturing
control problems.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.110
There's more description
in May and Spanos.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:54.100
But essentially, over time,
the ability to optically

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.910
line up the existing
structures--

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.630
typically, you might
actually use alignment marks

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.530
that you build up in
parallel to these transistors

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.810
to aid in the optical--

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:14.140
automatic optical recognition of
spatial locations on the wafer.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.630
It's a huge challenge
to then line that up

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:24.460
with the physical mask plate,
such that you minimize offsets.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.970
There's also exquisite
environmental control

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.440
in the equipment
that's used for this.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.890
Imagine that I don't
need to line up just

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.080
for one transistor--

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:42.625
I got to make sure across maybe
a 1 centimeter squared or 2

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:46.690
centimeter squared chip
that all of my transistors

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.010
are lining up.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.510
And in fact, in
older technologies,

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.510
I had to make sure the
whole wafer was lined up,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.790
because I had a big glass plate
that I was using in almost

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.810
a one-for-one transformation, so
everything across a whole wafer

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.430
had to be lined up.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.120
And if the temperature
of the glass plate

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:09.000
and out of the wafer
were off by a degree,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.420
the thermal expansion
would upset the alignment,

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.620
for example.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.520
So over time, you've seen--

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.340
both to achieve
smaller dimension,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.070
but also to achieve
better control--

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.740
a number of [INAUDIBLE]
driver for the evolution

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.490
of the photolithographic
equipment.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:34.560
One step was photolithographic
reduction from, say, a 10 to 1

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:42.390
or a 5 to 1 glass plate down
to a smaller chip or smaller

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:43.020
wafer.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.120
The second was
chip-to-chip stepping.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.970
So in fact, the
photolithography equipment's

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.850
typically called now a
stepper, because it's imaging

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.510
one field, maybe one chip.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.210
There may be more than
one chip in each field,

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.900
but I'm stepping through
in order to get the control

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.930
and be able to achieve
the alignment on one

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.080
chip at a time.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.360
And in the most
modern equipment,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.110
in fact, they don't even image
the whole chip at one time.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.410
They're imaging
slices of that so

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.820
that they can do all kinds
of other on the fly alignment

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.660
control, as well as
leveling, because turns out

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.270
the depth of focus
is a big constraint.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:31.310
And if I have a
focal plane mismatch,

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.620
where I'm in focus on
the left side of the chip

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.420
and not on the right,
then I don't get

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.800
the dimensional control I need.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.500
So it's really
amazing innovations

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.160
that are exactly driven
by the manufacturing

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.273
control necessary.

00:38:48.273 --> 00:38:49.940
So there's a little
bit more description

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:55.560
in here talking about some
of that equipment as well.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.460
In fact, I'm not really
talking here much

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.130
about the processing equipment.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:05.420
I'm trying to get us
through at least the process

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.850
sequence, but the equipment
itself is fascinating.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.860
It's really fascinating.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.980
OK, we're almost there with
this device, because now we're

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:18.510
primarily just repeating these
same kinds of structures.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.010
What we're going to do now is
another photolithography step.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.020
Here, essentially what we want
to do with this yellow layer

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:31.530
is build up an insulating layer.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.510
So I think a new layer of
silicon dioxide is deposited.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.400
In this case, it's
not thermally grown

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.650
through that chemical
reaction of oxide.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:44.690
And silicon-- because I've
already got polysilicon,

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.400
I've got--

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.900
well, I guess it actually
might work in this case.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.310
I've already got a very thick
layer of silicon in this case,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.720
we use typically a chemical
vapor deposition process--

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.490
again, in vacuum equipment.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:03.920
But we decompose
silicon dioxide carrying

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.350
molecules in a gas plasma.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.010
So there will be a more complex
molecule typically coming in,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.170
and we decompose that,
and basically, it

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.140
snows on the
surface of the wafer

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.760
and builds up a
silicon dioxide layer.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.910
So we deposit that
silicon dioxide,

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:27.600
and what we're going to do is
now open up holes within that

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.680
using a photolithography step.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.280
You can see here's the mask,
where we want to open up

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.340
a hole; down, where we'll
be able to make contact

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.470
to the gate and make contact
to the source and drain.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.140
So we go through again--
photolithography,

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:51.670
put our resist down, expose
it, develop it, plasma etch--

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.370
again, controllably
etching through the oxide,

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.820
stopping on the silicon layer.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:03.650
Remove the photoresist, and
now we put down a metal layer.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.130
Now, typically, what's
done for metal layers

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.835
is some form of physical
vapor deposition, where--

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.100
one example is a
metal evaporator

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.930
where the wafer will be
positioned some distance away

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.820
from a metal source.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.290
The metal source-- aluminum
or other materials--

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:36.490
will be heated up, either
directly electrically

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:41.320
or under sputtering
kinds of activity,

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.220
such that either
individual molecules

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.630
or small agglomerations of
molecules become very excited,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:42:01.620
and traject through the
vacuum, and build up the layer

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.080
on the surface of the wafer.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.090
So in this case, this
is an older technology.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.010
They're talking about
this being aluminum.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.188
I'll show you a little
bit later that most

00:42:10.188 --> 00:42:12.870
of the most advanced
chips are now

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:17.020
using a copper interconnect,
which has other challenges.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.010
So the basic idea
is now, again, we've

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.890
covered the whole
surface of the wafer,

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.280
and we selectively go in
with a photolithography step

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.170
and remove where we don't want
the metal lines protected,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.720
where I'm not going
to want to etch.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.540
I'm protecting parts
of the aluminum,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.730
and then I do a plasma
etch or a chemical

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:44.660
etch in order to
remove the aluminum.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.790
And then I remove--

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:50.840
strip away the photoresist,
leaving my structure.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.910
Now, this is a single level
metal, very simple transistor.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:03.110
And building up a several
billion transistor

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:06.560
chip, or even a 100
transistor chip,

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.230
we now need to also
electrically interconnect

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.790
all of those devices.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.210
And there's a whole additional
sequence of process steps

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:18.950
that are used to build multiple
levels of metal contact,

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.560
but conceptually, they're
very similar to those

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.930
that we've seen so far.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.930
Here I've got access to
this individual transistor.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.700
Clearly, laterally, I can
have neighboring transistors

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.810
that I've wired together
with the patterned aluminum.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.240
When you get a certain
number of transistors,

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.110
it becomes very hard to have
just one level of wiring.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.120
You need to be able
to have a wire that

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.490
goes over another
wire, and that's

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.580
where we get to multiple
level interconnect structures,

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.670
where one would deposit
another layer of silicon

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:58.760
dioxide or other insulator and
then build vertical [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.540
down from one level to the next
to contact multiple streets

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:08.210
on level 2 with streets on
level 1, and so on, up to 6,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.240
8, or even 10 levels of
metal in modern structures.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:18.770
AUDIENCE: So
[INAUDIBLE] are there

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:24.722
several transistors above
each other or just connectors?

00:44:24.722 --> 00:44:26.180
DUANE BONING: Yeah--
good question.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.100
Almost all existing
semiconductor chips

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.070
are planar processes, meaning
all of the transistors

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.090
are in just one plane, just
at the surface of the silicon.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.540
In fact, let me
hand this around.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.100
This just has a
copper interconnect

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.750
test pattern on it, so--

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.590
but this is an 8-inch
wafer, and the basic idea

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.640
is we can get that
very nicely grown

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.660
silicon layer and control of the
surface of the silicon layer.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.460
It's actually quite
difficult to build up

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:05.190
multiple levels of independent
and high-quality silicon

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.110
layers on the wafer.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:08.970
There's an awful
lot of research--

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:16.740
pass that around-- for
3D integrated circuits,

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.190
where one would, in fact, build
multiple strata or multiple

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.190
layers of transistors, and
then bond the wafers together

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.070
to be able to have in a
very compact form factor

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.360
multiple devices in
the third dimension.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.780
You get lots of benefits
of smaller footprint.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.800
At that coarse
level of 3D, I would

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.230
say many several memory chip
makers are already doing chip

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.390
stacking within one packet.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.490
So in some of the memory chips,
if you were to etch away that--

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.300
the black packaging casing
around one of those chips,

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.840
you might find a stacking.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.530
But they are not heavily
electrically interconnected.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.810
It's not a fully
integrated structure.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.840
In fact, at the end of
the day, they typically

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.860
have bond wires--

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.890
big macroscopic wires coming
in the sides of the chip

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.653
separately at each
of the stacking.

00:46:17.653 --> 00:46:18.820
Now, there's other variants.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:26.070
So for example, many of
the thin film transistor,

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.660
TFT displays will
actually have a layer

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.210
of transistors that are a
deposited layer of polysilicon,

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.120
not quite the same
pure crystalline layer.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.900
And sometimes those include
stacked transistors.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.030
So there are some technologies.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.220
They're just not
quite the same quality

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.280
or the same high-speed nature.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:58.780
OK, anybody detect any other
obvious mistakes or errors

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.810
in their pictures?

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.080
Maybe it was just that
one, that one inability

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.940
to control of the etch
down to a 100 angstroms.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.340
Now, there's lots of other
abstractions in here.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.040
And one of the other neat
things in this picture is it's

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:15.880
showing--

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.730
you're building up a
fairly complicated geometry

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.150
using controllable processes.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.280
One of the most
important things that you

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.430
have for control of this
lateral differentiation

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.410
is photolithography.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.830
Notice, we were never
just depositing directly

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.570
aluminum where we wanted it.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.090
It's always a--
deposit everywhere,

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.620
because you can do that across--

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.710
in parallel across the
whole surface of the wafer,

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:45.010
and then have to go back
and do a subtractive process

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.800
to typically remove
what you want.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.030
There are very, very few steps
where you can selectively

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:56.840
grow or selectively add
material only where you want it.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.150
So that's an example
of a huge constraint

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.610
in semiconductor processing.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.490
So what I want to
do now, with that

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.850
as the overview of
the unit process

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.460
and how they all
stack up to build

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.290
a more complicated structure--

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.240
I want to talk a
little bit about of

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.260
the input-output picture of
semiconductor processing.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.880
This is very similar to
our generic picture that--

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.430
hopefully you guys have started
reading that process control

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.420
overview--

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.570
where we've got different
inputs to the unit process,

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.440
including the raw
material, the wafer.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.260
We've got inputs in
terms of the environment

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.210
that we create
around the wafer--

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.680
that vacuum process, the
chemical [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:50.590
the gas ambient used in
plasma etching; and then

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.930
other control factors
on the machine

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.190
or the facility-- things
like thermal control

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.120
in photolithography--
to be able to ensure

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.120
that there's not thermal
expansion of the components.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.840
And then we get changes in
many of these wafers, many

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.830
of these states.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.540
Many of these are desirable.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.410
We saw the change in the wafer
state in terms of the geometry,

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.050
as well as things
like doping processes

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.800
that change the conductivity
of the silicon layers.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.690
But we also often
have the side effects

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.300
changes in the state
of the equipment.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.540
And this turns out to
be a big deal in much

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.160
of semiconductor control.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.790
So for example, every one
of those coating processes

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.830
occurs in some
kind of a chamber.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.270
I coat up a film.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.970
I coat aluminum on the
surface of the wafer.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.570
What do you think happens
to the rest of the chamber?

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.370
It gets coated too.

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.310
So over time, you will often
get buildup of material

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.050
in the rest of the
equipment, and there

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.530
will need to be other steps
to go in and clean or reset

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.370
the equipment state.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:55.390
So actually, we
often are worried

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.455
not only about the
product and what's

00:49:57.455 --> 00:49:59.830
happening with the product,
but in manufacturing control,

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.330
we're also very
worried about what's

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.290
happening with the equipment.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.850
So what we often don't
have control over

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.380
are all these disturbances.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.710
There may be variations
in the process coming

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.320
from lots of different sources.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.210
Some might be the
incoming material.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.370
In this case, if
there's variability

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.270
in the starting wafer, or
the wafer as processed up

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:25.210
to some step, that might
interact with the step

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.770
that we're now performing, and
limit our ability to control.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.200
And then similarly,
there may be influences

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.280
of variation coming from the
machine, or the facility,

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.262
or the wafer environment.

00:50:38.262 --> 00:50:39.970
So what I want to do
is talk a little bit

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.630
about some of those different
kinds of variations,

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.890
and build on what
we've seen here.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:50.240
Now, I mentioned this
a little bit last time.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.080
It used to be 10 years
ago, 15 years ago,

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.470
if we talked about yield--

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.600
the percentage of
functioning devices

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.180
that came out of
semiconductor fab--

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:07.965
the main worry limiting
yield was particle defects.

00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:10.090
And you can imagine, we're
talking about very, very

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.530
small features here.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:18.260
And if pieces of extraneous
matter were to fall between,

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.240
say, two metal lines that would
cause an electrical short--

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.920
or could cause an
electrical short--

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.510
and now the device
does not function.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.980
It does not function correctly.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.450
In other cases, the
particle-- if it happened

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:39.930
to appear in the photoresist,
it might cause an open

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.160
in one of these lines.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:49.710
It might prevent-- or cause
me to actually regions

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.070
where I didn't want to.

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:52.650
So not only can I have shorts--

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.360
I might have opens
between lines.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.740
And this defect control
was the primary source

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.650
of yield loss in the fab.

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:10.020
That's why, if you go into
an IC fab, it's a clean room.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.720
Everybody's wearing
clean room garments.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.240
There's incredible
amounts of airflow

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.320
to filter out and
remove all kinds of dust

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.810
particles or other
extraneous matter

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.230
down to very, very
tiny dimensions.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.630
That's really the
measures that have

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:29.940
been taken in order
to get the cleanliness

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.400
you need in order to--

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.340
not eliminate, but get
those particles down

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:40.620
to a particle density and
down to a presence of size

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:44.730
that are small enough not to
have too big of a yield impact.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:49.920
What I mean by size is imagine
that little dust particle

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.080
is only a quarter of the width
of any of the minimum feature

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.180
sizes on your structure.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:01.860
Well, that might mean I lose
a quarter of the width of one

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.890
of those metal lines, but
at least it still conducts.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.500
It might have a slightly higher
resistance than I expect,

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.320
but functionally, I'm still OK.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.650
Similarly, if it's too
small of a particle

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.990
to bridge between lines, I'm
not going to have a short.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.770
So the idea is to control
the particles down

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:21.090
to a certain feature.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.880
Now, there are some very
interesting manufacturing

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.370
control technologies
that are used

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:31.440
to characterize the
presence and density

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.960
of these kinds of particles.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.210
And what I pictured
here is a metal layout,

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.970
a metal patterned structure--
referred to as a nest

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:42.930
structure--

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:50.010
that allows one to build a large
number of these snaking lines,

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:55.440
and electrically connect
between these different lines

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.930
in order to test if there is a
bridging defect between lines,

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:03.310
and count the number
of those events.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:06.090
So you build this structure
to spatially sample

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.880
as large an area as you
can to try to capture

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.130
some number of these defects.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.290
And you can also
use this structure

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.450
to characterize the
size of these defects,

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.090
especially if they're
relatively large.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:21.900
So for example, if I
had a big particle that

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.760
bridged three of these lines,
I know, within certain bounds,

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:32.940
that I've got a particle
between some size interval.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.800
And so that's what's
shown over here

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.400
is a defect count as a
function of the size,

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.870
in microns, of different
particles for these large area

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.760
sampling structures.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.384
Now, this turns
out to be still a--

00:54:48.384 --> 00:54:50.910
an important part of
semiconductor fabrication

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.400
is understanding your
defect densities,

00:54:53.400 --> 00:55:00.270
defect counts, understanding
what the typical sizes are,

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:03.810
what levels of the
process they come in.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.510
Are you mostly getting these
in aluminum deposition?

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.630
Are you mostly getting these
in other etch processes?

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.690
And actually, then
feeding that information

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:18.150
to design for
manufacturability to optimize

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.850
the layout of the
circuit to minimize

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:27.510
the likelihood of a particle
falling in a bad location.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:29.910
And we'll talk about
that, I think, somewhere

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.120
near the midpoint or second--

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.900
last third of the course.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.340
We'll talk about yield modeling
and some of the technologies

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.080
that are used for
characterizing, statistically,

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.570
the point defects,
particle defects, and some

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:53.730
of the strategies used for
optimizing or minimizing impact

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:55.110
on circuits.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.210
But what is becoming
much more important--

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.730
and we mentioned this
on Tuesday as well--

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.680
is parametric control.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.960
And in some cases,
even these defect

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.620
controls turn into
parametric control problems

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.210
if what I'm worried about is not
so much yes-no functionality,

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.440
but changes in the
resistance of lines because

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.150
of the presence of defects.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.720
And so much more
broadly than defects,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.730
we're much more concerned
with continuous parameter

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:30.750
control of geometry as well as
some of these other properties

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.400
that we saw in the sequence.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.360
So for example, that
critical dimension control

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:42.260
might be the channel length
of transistors on my device,

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.300
and inherently,
you're going to have

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.260
some statistical distribution
on channel length.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.020
Call that L.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.360
So for example, if I were--
let me start down here--

00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:01.240
if I were to sample many
nominally identical transistors

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.220
that were laid out
exactly the same,

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.470
were assumed to behave
exactly the same,

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.200
and I measured some
electrical characteristic

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.210
or some geometric
characteristic,

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:12.790
I might get a distribution--

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:14.200
drawn here as a Gaussian.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.500
It's not always, but very
often, that's a great model

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.000
and I might have
some distribution

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.130
of that across the chip.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.880
And very often, there are
inherent physical limitations

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:32.150
in the process that give rise
to those sources of variation,

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.050
some of which we'll come
back to-- might be systematic

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.760
or might be random.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.540
Now, what's interesting is
we have a physical nesting.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.640
On the wafer, we
have many chips.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.650
Now, if I were to
take and measure

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.230
the same transistor
on each chip,

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.390
I would also get a distribution.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:53.080
I have a chip-to-chip
variability in parameters,

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.620
and often that will come because
of different physical causes.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.190
It may be we're doing that
photolithographic stepping,

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.360
and every time, I have a little
bit different overlay control

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.010
or offset control.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.190
So the source of this may be--

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:14.770
this distribution may be
because of wafer level

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:17.410
or across wafer sources
of variation that

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:20.470
are very different than the
sources of physical variation

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:24.550
of replication of
transistors within the chip.

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:27.640
And we also can have
wafer-to-wafer variations.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.790
Again, if I were to either
calculate the average over one

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.160
wafer, or maybe
just sample exactly

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.090
the same location on every
wafer and stack that up

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:41.950
across 24 wafers or large
numbers of wafers that

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:47.200
might be in one lot, processed
even relatively close in time

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.650
to each other, there's also
going to be a deviation.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:55.780
And that might arise because of
changes in the equipment state

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.390
from one run to the next.

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:03.310
The first wafer-- it may
have a pristine equipment

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.060
with no build-up on the-- of
material on the wafer wall.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.180
The next wafer might see a
slightly different process--

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.830
unintentionally-- than the
previous one because of changes

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:18.040
or degradation in the
equipment state over time

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.840
affecting that wafer state.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.650
That might be an example.

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.560
And then finally, in
semiconductor fab,

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.850
we typically are
processing a lot of wafers.

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:30.370
That may be 24 wafers at a time.

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:32.710
And from one lot
to the next, these

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:36.550
might be processed at
substantially different points

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:37.160
in time.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.120
And there may be another
distribution associated

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.040
with that, and
physical sources are

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.110
causes of that
variation that are

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:49.840
different than these other
spatial or temporal sources.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.540
Some companies-- and
there's not a lot of them

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:57.880
these days-- have multiple fabs,
so I could continue this up.

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.300
Intel in particular is
very famous for making

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.210
the same product in multiple
fabs, in multiple states,

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:07.390
and in fact, multiple
countries around the world.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:11.315
And they work very, very hard
to have matching from one fab

01:00:11.315 --> 01:00:12.940
to the other, in
terms of the equipment

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.660
and so on, to minimize
fab-to-fab deviations

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.400
or differences in their chips.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.070
They really don't
want people saying,

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:26.350
I'm only going to buy
my Pentium or Itanium

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:29.380
chip from the Albuquerque
fab, because it's

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:33.720
better than the one from
Portland or whatever.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.560
They really want
to minimize that.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.630
So you've got extensions
up the hierarchy as well.

01:00:42.342 --> 01:00:43.800
Now, if we were to
actually zoom in

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.130
on one of those
distributions, what's also

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.140
going to be very
interesting is trying

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.260
to understand what the
sources of variation

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.230
are at each of the
spatial scales.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.710
And you might have a fairly
complex distribution, say,

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.090
over channel length.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.570
And what's often very, very much
the case, and very interesting

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:08.010
is that total distribution
is the compounded effective

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:13.930
multiple additional sources
that are convolved together.

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:19.600
And a lot of work will be done
in designing test procedures,

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.060
designing process
control charts,

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.840
and whatnot to be able to
track individual contributors

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.540
and separate them out into the
component sources of variation.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.460
Why do you want to do this?

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.390
If you can identify
individual sources,

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:42.400
that's crucial to being able
to go and squeeze them down.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.090
You got to know what the source
is in order to remove it.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:49.390
What else is the case
often is that some of these

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.790
are not completely random.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.490
Many of the sources
of variation have

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:57.910
a systematic physical cause.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:05.090
And if we understand what
is systematic or repeatable

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:08.180
every time you run
this, you might actually

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.040
find that the transistor in the
upper right corner of the chip

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.960
is a little bit too wide.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.940
You might then
track that back to

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.490
the photolithographic
imperfection that's

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.510
causing that.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.350
Once you know that, you can
compensate and counteract

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:28.500
that source of variation.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.443
A lot of the work is
trying to break these down.

01:02:33.443 --> 01:02:35.610
So let me give you a little
bit more example of some

01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:40.920
of these sources of variation,
and the tools and techniques

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.990
that are evolving
to handle them.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.378
Let me zoom into
one unit process.

01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:49.920
We've done actually
a lot of research

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.670
on chemical mechanical
polishing in semiconductor fab.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:03:00.470
And the basic process is you
take that wafer, you press it--

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.270
or you hold it in
a wafer carrier

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:06.890
and press it face down
onto a rotating table

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:11.360
or [INAUDIBLE] to which is
affixed an abrasive path.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.510
You also drip a wet
abrasive slurry--

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:19.010
so it's a very, very
fine particle grit--

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:22.190
in a chemically active
slurry, and then

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:28.550
you rotate both the wafer
and the pad, or the table.

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:32.810
And the basic goal
of this is to flatten

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:38.990
the surface of the wafer, if
you go back to this picture,

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:43.610
with even one level of metal,
look at all of the topography,

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.950
the differences in heights
that are generated,

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:49.070
because we're etching down,
filling in, and so on.

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.760
If one were to try to build
multiple levels of metal,

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.380
you have a real problem here.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.860
You keep building up
in some regions where

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.140
you have more metal,
and in those regions

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.190
where you don't, you get thinner
and thinner by comparison.

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:10.130
That becomes a huge challenge
in terms of other processes,

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:13.250
like photolithography-- talked
about that depth of focus.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:18.170
Now I want a pattern or image at
the top of one of these levels,

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.900
and I've got also these
recessed regions--

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:25.400
become very difficult to
image, say, a metal 4 layer.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.315
And so CMP has been
created to basically

01:04:32.315 --> 01:04:37.070
abrade away the raised
surfaces, get it

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:41.200
down to a planar surface.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.330
Now, one of the
big problems in CMP

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:52.490
is the process itself is
often not all that stable.

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:56.540
That polishing pad,
that abrasive path--

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.220
what happens if
you use sandpaper

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.110
for a while on a piece of wood?

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:04.070
Well, you smooth out
the grain or whatever

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:05.330
in the piece of wood.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:08.150
What happens to your sandpaper?

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.560
It also wears-- fills in.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.110
It gets gooky.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.900
Basically, it
changes its state--

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.850
the process and the
equipment changes

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:19.260
it state over
fabrication as well.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.920
And if you looked at the
normalized removal rate

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.890
for a 350-wafer
sequence, you will often

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:31.730
find drift in the removal rate.

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.010
You might start out with a
fairly high removal rate,

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.230
and over time, it drifts down.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:42.950
This is something like at
20% or 40% kind of drift.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:45.320
Similarly, if you
looked at the wafer--

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.460
measured some pattern,
some eight-sample point,

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.010
and calculated a
non-uniformity metric--

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:56.650
maybe its standard
deviation of those points--

01:05:56.650 --> 01:06:00.400
one would find--
maybe you can see

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.360
it-- looks like there's a slight
increase in that non-uniformity

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.690
over time.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:08.930
The pad is not quite
as uniform as well.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:13.660
So this is the kind of temporal
wafer-to-wafer variation

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:19.030
that you don't want, and
would like to understand it.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.490
If there's a systematic
trend, then maybe there

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:24.850
are control approaches that
can be used to compensate

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.060
or correct for that.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.815
Yeah?

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:29.605
AUDIENCE: This polishing
seems to be a bad idea to me.

01:06:29.605 --> 01:06:36.550
[INAUDIBLE] a way to getting,
like you said, [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:37.412
DUANE BONING: Yeah.

01:06:37.412 --> 01:06:39.370
The semiconductor industry
really got its start

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:43.930
about 1960, and for
30 years, it was all

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.630
about defects, those particles.

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.750
Keep them away from the
wafer at whatever cost.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.280
And then primarily, folks
from IBM around 1990

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.190
said, yeah, we're
going to pour slurries

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:00.773
with 100-nanometer
particles on it,

01:07:00.773 --> 01:07:02.440
and then we're going
to rub the heck out

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.240
of the surface of your wafer.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.640
And everybody thought
they were crazy.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:15.010
But it turns out that, first
off, the control of the process

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.910
can be very good in
terms of not a very, very

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.920
fine abrading of the surface.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.480
So you're not gouging out.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.010
You're really doing almost
nanometer-by-nanometer scale

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.240
abrasion.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.260
But then you still have
all those particles.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.900
So a lot of the work was very,
very effective post-polish

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:39.460
cleaning processes that
involve chemical baths,

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.300
that involve brush
cleaning, in fact,

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:47.170
that involve hydroponic
agitation to levitate

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:51.820
the particles off of the surface
of the wafer in a clean bath--

01:07:51.820 --> 01:08:00.350
that they actually found no
appreciable defect-oriented

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.250
yield loss, once you did
those extreme measures

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.720
to clean up the wafer.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.720
And in fact, the
irony ended up being

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:15.080
that the CMP processed,
by planarizing, actually

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.689
improved the defectivity.

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:23.000
Because many of these particles
might be present in layer 3,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.500
you've got a lump, but it didn't
destroy the action of level 3.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.859
But if it's sticking up, by
the time you go in to level 4

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:33.350
and you do a
metalization over that,

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.270
well, now you've got a problem.

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:39.680
And the CMP process, which would
go in and flatten or planarize

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.979
between levels, would
actually chop the heads off

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:46.310
of these defects and
reduce their impact

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.890
for subsequent levels.

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:55.010
But it is a fascinating
story of the adoption of CMP,

01:08:55.010 --> 01:09:01.790
because it was so
counterintuitive of a process,

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:03.649
exactly as you said.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:09.080
So we'll come back at the end
or later to control strategies,

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.819
for dealing with this--

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:11.750
of the course.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.000
Basically, this
kind of a drift--

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.640
you could start to think,
well, I can measure this,

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.580
and maybe what I would like
to do on subsequent runs--

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.430
if my removal rate
has drifted down,

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:24.350
I'd like a strategy
where I polish

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.899
a little bit longer or I
press a little bit harder--

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.220
these sorts of things.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.771
AUDIENCE: So you only do this
polishing at the very end?

01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:32.479
DUANE BONING: No.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:33.635
You do it at each level--

01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:34.593
AUDIENCE: At each level

01:09:34.593 --> 01:09:37.850
DUANE BONING: --each
metal level, as well as

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:39.950
in some other places.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:45.710
So it's actually used repeatedly
in multilevel interconnect.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.080
Here's an example of
a little test chip

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.500
to try to characterize some
of those spatial variations,

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.380
and decompose them
that we talked about.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:10:01.210
This is a chip design that has
a few thousand ring oscillators.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:06.560
A ring oscillator is a chain
of an odd number of inverters,

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.590
each of which does a
logic zero to one or one

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:11.900
to zero computation.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.840
And if you organize
those in a ring fashion,

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.300
it oscillates at
some high frequency

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.420
that indicates the speed of
the individual transistors

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.630
in that structure.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:25.610
So a ring oscillator is a
wonderful stand-in electronic

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:30.170
circuit telling you a lot about
the speed of your technology.

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:34.460
What we did is built
a tiled architecture,

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.090
where we've got thousands of
these structures; replicated

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:41.720
spatially, so now we can
measure multiple instances

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.270
and see if there's
a spatial pattern;

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:45.800
well as we can
also play with some

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.120
of the design parameters of
each of those ring oscillators.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.010
And in particular,
we can do things

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.280
like take that
silicon gate electrode

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.830
and split it into three of them.

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.220
We can play with the spacing
between those electrodes.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.940
We can orient those
[INAUDIBLE] vertically

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.940
or horizontally on the layout.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.270
We can also look at the
effective nearby structures.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:15.440
For example, how
dense per unit area

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:21.110
do you have transistors or
polysilicon gate electrodes?

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.170
Would that have an effect
on the ring oscillator?

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.135
And now, if you go
out and build this,

01:11:26.135 --> 01:11:28.970
this is a wonderful
kind of data,

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:32.720
where you can
aggregate or map out

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.420
the data at these
different spatial scales

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.290
to look for trends.

01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:40.970
So for example, if we look
at the wafer scale variation

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.930
in the ring oscillator
speed, we've

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:45.800
got something like 30 chips
in the upper half of one

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.970
of these wafers.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.800
And mapped out
here and the color

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.900
is the average ring oscillator
speed from high to low.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:01.110
And you can see a spatial trend
from one side of the wafer

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.710
to the other.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.860
This is telling us there is
a wafer level non-uniformity,

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.970
and in fact, that across
wafer variation is about 9%

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:12.400
in speed of these devices.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.070
You can also then
start to look--

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:15.870
I guess that's the same thing--

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.850
you can also start
to look and say,

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.200
depending on how you
designed the transistor,

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.910
what kind of offsets do
you get in the frequency

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.700
and what kind of
variation do you

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:35.500
get in the speed of the devices?

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.510
And what's interesting here
is that many of these ring

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.360
oscillator designs are--
from the circuit designer

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.780
perspective, they think
of them as identical.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.170
But in fabrication,
because of neighborhood

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.340
or nearby structures, in fact,
there are slight deviations.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.380
So nominally
identical transistors

01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.360
may, in fact, have substantial
systematic, highly repeatable

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.500
effects.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.400
And if the manufacturing line
can capture and characterize

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.190
those, and send that
information to design,

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:12.260
design can compensate.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.090
So this is another theme.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:18.410
This design and manufacturing
link can be very important.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:24.950
We can also map out
identical transistors

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:26.960
within one of these chips.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.850
And here again, you can see
a top-to-bottom variation

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:34.260
in the ring oscillator speed.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.250
And in this case, that
within each individual chip

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:41.585
is about 4% in this
particular case,

01:13:41.585 --> 01:13:42.710
which is quite interesting.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:47.240
Notice we said there's 9%
across the whole wafer.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.170
I might have 10 chips lined
up in a line across the wafer.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.660
If I were to say,
from center to edge,

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.310
I have a systematic trend--

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:57.500
or from one edge of
the way for the other,

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.300
the systematic trend
of about 10%, and I

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.390
map that down to
1/10, because I've

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:09.270
got 10 ships, that would
be about a 1% variation,

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:12.120
you might expect, because
of wafer level sources

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.680
on each chip.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.770
But what we find is something
like 4% That's telling us

01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:21.790
there's a different source
of physical variation at work

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.160
within each of the chips.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.920
And then you can also look
for other systematic effects--

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.200
things like the proximity of
one [INAUDIBLE] to another

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.240
can have
photolithographic effects.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.350
And in particular, that
can result in an offset,

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.860
depending on whether I
have 1 micron, or 2 micron,

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.130
or 2x, or 3x spacing
between the devices.

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:49.610
But in this case, the variation
across many, many replicates

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.700
of each of those
is about the same.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.500
An interesting
effect is, if we take

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.940
that same [INAUDIBLE] that
single gate electrode and split

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.690
it up into two, or
split it up into three,

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:05.990
and then look at the effect
on ring oscillator speed

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:11.450
offset and variance, what do
you think we're going to see?

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:13.220
We didn't know, so
you may not know.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.020
Yeah?

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.805
AUDIENCE: Probably
see four variations

01:15:19.805 --> 01:15:23.792
in the [INAUDIBLE] one
because there are more edges.

01:15:23.792 --> 01:15:25.500
DUANE BONING: Right,
you have more edges.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.660
And that's exactly.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.250
If we look at the sigma with
one finger, two finger, or four

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:36.740
finger, we found a proportional
increase in the variance,

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.090
with more opportunities for
variation by the fingering.

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:46.040
So that was an interesting
implication for some design

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.070
kinds of effects.

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:53.000
OK, so that's an example
where design of experiments

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.010
could be used to come
up with test structures,

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:56.810
and characterize,
and split out some

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:59.190
of these sources of variation.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:02.620
Now, I'm not going to
go into the full detail

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.650
on these slides.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:06.070
I put more slides in
here than I needed

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.320
because this is a current
area of my research

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.770
and I get really
excited about it.

01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:11.770
But it helps
explain a little bit

01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:15.520
this multilevel interconnect.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.520
I'll cover the first
one very briefly.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.560
There's two sequences
that I didn't

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.400
talked about in the
earlier flow, because it's

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.990
a 10-year-old process.

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.380
Modern integrated
circuits-- especially

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.930
for microprocessor logic,
and now even memory--

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.000
are using copper interconnect.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.390
Copper conducts
better than aluminum.

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.430
You get speed improvements.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.480
You get reliability
improvements.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.360
It's a big drive
to move to copper.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.220
But it's a little bit more
complicated of a process.

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:51.310
The basic process is
different than an aluminum,

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:54.880
because we do not have
an effective plasma etch

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.650
process for the removal--

01:16:56.650 --> 01:16:58.990
selective removal of copper.

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:01.640
It's just a bad
process in that way.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.040
So instead, what we have to
do is go through the following

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.700
sequence.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.110
We go to photolithographically
etch in our insulating layer

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:15.880
where we want, ultimately,
the copper line to reside.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.480
Then we fill in
copper everywhere.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.270
We happen to do that using
an electroplating process,

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:25.940
and that electroplating
process results

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.720
in nice filling of features
of different sizes,

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.460
but it also overfills.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.000
And even more problematic is it
overfills to different amounts

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.570
or different thicknesses
depending on the feature size

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.860
that we filled up.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.470
So you get this very
complicated topography.

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:45.920
Now, I described CMP as
wonderful for flattening

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.330
and removing and
abrading away topography.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:52.430
So the second step is
using CMP to remove

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:54.890
all this excess copper.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.290
And it will polish away.

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:00.380
And ideally, you would
like to stop exactly

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.040
on the surface of the oxide and
have your nice remaining copper

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.530
lines where you wanted them.

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:11.240
But it also has a geometric
imperfection arising from

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.800
over-polish, where
big fat wide lines--

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.950
the polishing pad-- that
polyurethane pad-- actually

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:23.120
digs down in and over-polishes
certain features.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.440
And in regions where
you've got a lot of copper

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.950
and very little hard
supporting oxide,

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:31.990
it actually erodes
down in appreciably.

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:34.090
So these are some
systematic effects.

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:36.250
They are manufacturing
limitations,

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.890
and one would like to model
and characterize those.

01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:42.250
And in fact, that's what
this waiver was for.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:46.570
What we came up with was a test
structure methodology where

01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:50.680
you would put lots of features
of different sizes on a wafer,

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.160
run it through the process,
measure the results--

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.290
so this is a measurement of
the electroplated profile

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:02.320
for different feature sizes,
like those little lines

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.310
and spaces between the lines of
quarter micron, quarter micron,

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:09.910
versus say 100 micron
and 100 micron lines.

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:13.090
And then you could measure
the surface topography

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:17.890
and see how much overinflating
or how much underfill you might

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:21.290
have in each of those regions.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:24.200
Now, this is kind of a
neat example for something

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.290
that we'll be learning about
later in the term, which

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:29.570
is empirical modeling.

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:33.650
This is an empirical process,
where we run the wafer through,

01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:36.230
we take measurements,
and then we developed

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.620
in our first-level
model response

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.710
surface models
that are basically

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:47.580
power models as a function
of line width and line space.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.570
So you can empirically
fit a model

01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:53.840
that describes how
much overplating height

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.420
or what the step
height might be.

01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:01.130
And then one can use that
to characterize step height

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.640
or the amount of bulge as a
function of line width and line

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.760
space, and give some
feedback to the designers

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.340
saying, hey, if you
design in these ranges.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.460
This is what's actually
going to happen,

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.320
as opposed to what you
thought was going to happen.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.820
And so that's a little
response-- surface model

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.930
kind of example.

01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:22.910
And then one can also
build those perhaps

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:27.410
into design tools that could
predict for a whole chip--

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:28.910
maybe a product chip--

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:33.500
what the electroplated
process thickness would be

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.050
or what the CMP
process would be.

01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:37.070
I'm going to skip these.

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:40.280
This is essentially doing
the same thing for CMP,

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:44.240
but the idea here is this
linkage, again, between design

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.640
and manufacture, where
the manufacturing fab can

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.540
characterize what the actual
amount of dishing or erosion

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:57.200
is going to be for very
complicated product chips.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.550
And that information could
get fed back to the designer

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:05.180
so that they actually
know, in this location,

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:11.665
my final copper wire is going to
be this thick, not this thick.

01:21:11.665 --> 01:21:13.040
And that could be
very important,

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.220
because the thickness
of a copper wire

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:21.250
determines its
electrical resistance.

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:24.220
It even affects the
coupling capacitance

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.570
between to neighbor wires.

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:28.030
So those key
electrical parameters--

01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:32.140
resistance, capacitance-- that
determine interconnect speed

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.310
depend on that critically.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:41.710
So that linkage with robust
design can be very important.

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:43.480
One can also use
those kinds of models

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.020
to play with process
parameters, and empirically,

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.270
as a function of the
process conditions,

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:53.110
minimize these systematic
sources of variation.

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:57.490
And one approach that
is dominant in a number

01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:02.650
of industries is a capturing
of these dependencies on design

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:05.320
features, like line
width or line space,

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.530
and what is a good
region to be operating

01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:12.010
in in these ideas
of design rules.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.510
And so in fact,
this is some work

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:18.010
from LSI Logic looking at
the copper interconnect space

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:22.450
and saying, OK, what
region, what limits,

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:26.410
what combinations of line width
and line space can you have,

01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:28.510
and where are the
boundaries because

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.830
of some of these different
physical effects?

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:32.920
So for example,
photolithography says

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:37.180
I can't patent smaller
than certain dimensions.

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.890
Dishing limits, that dishing
down into wide features,

01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:42.970
says I can't have features
wider than 10 microns.

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.690
I'll dish them too much.

01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:46.450
So this is another
way of coupling

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:49.370
between design and manufacture.

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:51.200
And then the last
thing I've already

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.850
alluded to, but coming
back to the CMP problem,

01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:57.070
we also can develop--

01:22:57.070 --> 01:23:02.050
and we'll talk about response
surface or empirical models

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:06.250
that say, OK, here's
what the removal rate is,

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.480
or the non-uniformity is as a
function of some of the process

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.180
conditions, like the
speed of rotation,

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.390
or the pressure or
downforce of rotation.

01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:20.300
And once you have a
basic control model--

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.610
for example, the
normalized removal rate

01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:25.160
is a function of
downforce and speed--

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.940
I've got some input-output
empirical relationship between

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.660
these--

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:35.270
I can now use this in a
run-by-run control kind

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:39.050
of feedback situation, where
I make a measurement on every

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:40.520
wafer that comes out--

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.070
what the average
removal rate was--

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:46.310
use that together with
this empirical model,

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:50.030
perhaps do a model update
to track the changing state

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:54.290
of the equipment and pad as--
it also gets perturb from run

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:55.160
to run--

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.400
use that do model to
say, for the next wafer,

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.560
change the recipe slightly.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.870
Polish a little bit longer
or press a little bit

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:06.680
harder to compensate
for that known

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.540
characterized variation source.

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.250
And so this is just an example.

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:14.690
You can imagine that, using
these simplified models,

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:17.660
one can have some
compensation strategy that

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:20.990
brings the removal
rate back up to target.

01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:23.900
And so we'll talk about that
in the latter part of the term

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:24.720
as well.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.770
These are just examples
showing, for different numbers

01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:29.960
of wafers, you have
to actually change

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.440
the speed or the
pressure, downforce,

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.870
but you can get very good
control of the output.

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:40.790
So to wrap up for today,
this was a whirlwind tour

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:43.290
through the semiconductor
fabrication process,

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:46.340
and I hope you have a feel
for the myriad different kinds

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.060
of variations that are out
there, and a glimpse forward

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.840
to some of the
techniques that we're

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.670
going to be developing through
the term to deal with this.

01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:59.060
So we'll see you on Tuesday.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.870
Dave will be giving
that lecture and talking

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:05.360
about the rest of the
processes out there

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.582
in the world besides
semiconductor fabrication,

01:25:07.582 --> 01:25:09.290
and building up some
intuition that we'll

01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:12.650
use in those processes.

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:16.450
So get started on the
problem set as well.

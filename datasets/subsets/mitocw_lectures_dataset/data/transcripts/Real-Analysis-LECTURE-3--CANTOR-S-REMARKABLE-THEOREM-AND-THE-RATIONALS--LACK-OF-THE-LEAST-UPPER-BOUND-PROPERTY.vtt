CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So
here we are again.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to finish real
quick proof of a theorem

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that I stated last
time due to Cantor.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So let me recall the setting.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we
were finishing up

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
what I had to say about
cardinality, which remember,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:90%
is a notion of size of sets.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
for a given set A,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
then we defined
the power set of A

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to be the set of
all subsets of A.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And last time, for example,
we did several of them

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:84%
or looked at a few
different power sets.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And simplest example is that
the power set of the empty set

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is the set containing
the empty set.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
In particular, the power
has one more element

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
than the empty set.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:90%
The empty set has no elements.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The power set of the empty
set has one element, namely

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.575 align:middle line:90%
the empty set.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And we are looking at this
to answer a question which

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I posed at the end of
last class, namely,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
all the sets we saw
from the integers

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to even numbers to
rational numbers, which

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
is on the assignment, all
have the same cardinality

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:90%
as the natural numbers.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the countably infinite.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And so a question
would be, is there

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
any set that is
bigger in cardinality

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
then the natural numbers?

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Is there any set
that's uncountable?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this theorem due to
Cantor answers that and more.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And it says the following--

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
if A is any set, so if A is a
set, then the cardinality of A

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
is strictly smaller than
the cardinality of the power

00:02:47.540 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
set of A. And as a consequence
is that the natural numbers

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
have smaller size than the power
set of the natural numbers,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
which has smaller size than
the power set of the power

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
set of the natural numbers,
which is smaller in size

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:90%
than-- and so on.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are an
infinity of infinities.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.905 align:middle line:84%
There is an infinity
of infinite sizes.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove this theorem,
and it's extremely clever

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and a bit mind boggling.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So first, let me prove
that A has cardinality less

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to the cardinality
of the power set of A.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:90%
So let A be a set.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
First, we can show that the
cardinality of A is less than

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.760 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the cardinality
of the power set of A.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So we need to find an injection,
a one-to-one map from A

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
into the power set of A. And
the simplest one to choose

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
is one that takes
an element of A

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to the set containing
just that element.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So define f from A
into the power set of A

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:90%
by the function that takes x.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And this should spit
out a subset of A.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So this will be the subset
that consists solely of x.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is clearly one to one.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll prove this right now.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Then we need to prove that
if f of x equals f of y,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
then x equals y, but this is
clear from the definition.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Then if f of x equals f of y,
this means the set containing

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
x-- this is by the definition
of how we've defined little f--

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
means that the set
containing x is

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:90%
equal to the set containing y.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:90%
But this means x equals y.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:90%
They both contain one element.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.515 align:middle line:84%
Two sets are equal if
and only if one side

00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:90%
is an element of the other.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That just means x
equals y in the set.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Thus, f is one to
one, which since we

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
found an injective map from A to
the power set of A this means--

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So now we want to show that
they cannot have the same

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:90%
cardinality.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
We now show that A does not
have the same cardinality

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
as the power set of A. And
these two statements are

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:84%
what is meant when we write
down, recall the definition,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
of the cardinality
of A or size of A

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
being smaller than the
cardinality of the power

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
set of A.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do this
by a proof by contradiction.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So that means we're
going to assume

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that this does not hold and
arrive at a false statement.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So I assume that they do
have the same cardinality.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is our
initial assumption.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to derive a false
statement from this assumption.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to arrive
at a false statement

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
from a given assumption in a
logically consistent fashion

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is that the original statement,
namely this, is false.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the thing
we want to show is true.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume they have
the same cardinality.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists a bijective
function g going from A

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:90%
to the power set of A.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, a bijective
function means

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that G is one to one and onto.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
One to one meaning
different things of A

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
gets mapped to different
things of the power set.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Onto means everything
in the power set

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:90%
gets mapped onto from A.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So really, the fact
that it's surjective

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing
I'm going to use.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
define a weird set.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
look at this set.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So define a set B. And
this is a subset of A. B

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
is a set of all x's in A
such that x is not in f of x.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:90%
This should be g.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So remember, g maps
from A to the power set.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So for any given x in A,
g of x is a subset of A.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So the condition to be in B
is that this element x is not

00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:90%
in the image of itself by G.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And B could be empty.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
There could be no x's
in A that satisfy this.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a subset of
A, simply by definition.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
at elements in A that

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%
satisfy a certain condition.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So since it's a
subset of A, this

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.075 align:middle line:84%
means that it's a element
of the power set of A.

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
This is just how the
power set is defined.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Remember, it's all subsets of A

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So B is an element of the
power set of A. Therefore,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
something gets mapped
to B under this map.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So since g is surjective,
there exists b in capital A

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
such that g of little b
equals capital B. So this just

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:84%
follows from the fact
that g is a surjection,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
meaning everything
in here must get

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:90%
mapped to by some element in A.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's take
a look at this B guy.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:90%
There are two cases--

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
either b is in g of b
or b is not in g of b.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So b is in g of b.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
If b is in g of b, remember
this is equal to capital B,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:90%
by definition.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And to be in capital B means
that x is not in g of x.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:90%
So let me just write this again.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
This means b is in B, which
means b is not in g of b.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We started off
with b and g of b,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and ended with b
is not in g of b.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So we arrive at a false
statement in this case.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Then there's one other case--

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.135 align:middle line:90%
b is not in g of b.

00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Then if b is not in g of b,
this immediately implies,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
by the definition of
little b, meaning g of b

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is in capital B. So let
me write it this way.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So if b is not in g of b, then
from the definition of capital

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
B, this implies that b is
in capital B. That's just

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:84%
from the definition
of capital B.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:58.048 align:middle line:84%
But now capital B is
equal to g of little b,

00:13:58.048 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:90%
which is another contradiction.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we started with
this and ended with this.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:90%
So what I've really proven is--

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
so let's ignore this
contradiction mark here--

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
thus, we have shown that b in
g of b implies b not in g of b.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:84%
b not in g of b
implies b is in g of b.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven the statement
that b is in g of b if

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and only if b is not in g of b.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
false statement--

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
cannot have some object being in
the set if and only if it's not

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:90%
in the set.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So we've arrived at
a false statement.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our
initial assumption

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
which led us there, namely that
the cardinality of the set A

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
has the same cardinality
as the power set of A,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.925 align:middle line:90%
must have been false.

00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So it feels almost like you're
being hoodwinked a little bit

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:90%
with this proof.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But to give you some sort
of cling or connection

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
back to reality, what's
underlying this argument

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
or what's one way of
understanding this argument is

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to think about--

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
so in some sense, what
this argument does

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
is make you talk
about being in B

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
while having to also
reference B itself.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this seems a bit wild
because this is a math course,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
but you can do the statement
just in the English language.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
If I am to tell you
that I am a liar,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
then if that statement is
true, then what I just said,

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:84%
namely that I am
a liar, is false,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:90%
which means I'm not a liar.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, "I am a liar"
implies I'm not a liar.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And vice versa-- if
I say, "I am a liar,"

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and that statement
is false, meaning

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a liar, then
that statement is true,

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:90%
which implies I am a liar.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I
would not lie to you.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I would just give you
alternative facts.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But that statement
is kind of what's

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
underlying this argument.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put that
there, true or false.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:59.583 align:middle line:84%
That's the connection to
these two things, loosely,

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or at least the
logic is contained

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
in trying to verify
this statement.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's all I'm going
to say about cardinality.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move on
to the real numbers now.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really, like I
said in the previous lecture,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
our first real goal of the
class is to describe R. namely,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is the
set of real numbers?

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
What characterizes the
set of real numbers?

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so let me state
this as a theorem

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
just completely ahead of time,
so that it's there for us.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is our goal, although
we're not going to prove it.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is just to understand
what this theorem says.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is a complete
description of what R is.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
There exists a unique
ordered field containing Q

00:19:47.440 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
with the least upper bound
property, which we denote

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:90%
by R, instead of real numbers.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit there and listen
to this, you shouldn't have--

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe you do, but
you really shouldn't

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
expect to have any idea
about what this theorem says,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:90%
what all these words mean.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:34.205 align:middle line:84%
So our goal for this lecture is
to make sense of these words.

00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So the rest you
should understand.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So our goal for this lecture is
to make sense of these words,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
"ordered field," "least
upper bound property."

00:20:51.830 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Because these are the two
defining characteristics of R.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
prove this theorem.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
take it as a given.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We could prove this theorem but
it takes quite a bit of time.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd rather start
studying properties of R

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
than building R. This is
not so uncommon in math,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that one is not especially
interested in the proof

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of actually why
certain things exist,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
but we are definitely interested
in the properties of that thing

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:90%
once we know it exists.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.927 align:middle line:84%
So let's get started
on making sense

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:90%
of what this theorem says.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's start off
with ordered stuff.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
This has ordered field,
least upper bound property.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's start off with
what do I mean by order.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.863 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that just
a little bit already

00:22:05.863 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
when we talked about
the natural numbers

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and this well-ordered property
of the natural numbers.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.972 align:middle line:84%
But I was just using words
to label a certain property

00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
of the natural numbers.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say they meant
anything specifically.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It was just a label for that.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I say "order" now, this
will definitely mean something.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So ordered sets and
fields definition--

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.300 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
an ordered set is a
set S with a relation,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
which we label with
this less than symbol .

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And this relation
satisfies two properties.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
One is you can always check
whether two elements are bigger

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:90%
than each other or equal.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So for all x, y in S, either
x equals y, x is less than y,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
or that's just restating,
y is less than x.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.618 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.618 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And if x is less than
y, and y is less than z,

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
then x is less than z.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So an ordered set is just a
set with some relation which

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
has two properties,
namely that for any two

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
elements in the set,
I can compare the two.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what this says.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
transitive property

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that if x is less than y,
and y is less than z, then

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%
x is less than z.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And so as I said
before, whenever

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
you have some sort of mildly
interesting definition,

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
you should definitely
try to come up

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:90%
with examples and non-examples.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.485 align:middle line:84%
So what's the simplest
example of an ordered set?

00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:48.242 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.242 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the natural
numbers, which we

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
discussed earlier,
but also the integers,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
where I have to define
what this relation means.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
We say m is less than n,
this m is less than n,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
if n minus m is
a natural number.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we
define our order.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.385 align:middle line:84%
So n is bigger than m if n
minus m is a natural number.

00:25:22.385 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can check that this is
just the usual ordering on z.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And that satisfies
these two properties.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:44.932 align:middle line:84%
The standard order on Q,
namely that we'll say q

00:25:44.932 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
is less than r if there
exist natural numbers, m, n,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.923 align:middle line:84%
such that r minus
q equals m over n.

00:25:59.923 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
the usual orders

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.382 align:middle line:84%
of orderings on the integers
and rational numbers

00:26:14.382 --> 00:26:15.965 align:middle line:84%
that you're used to
and that you know.

00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just writing out exactly
how one would define this order.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can check just using
this definition of these orders

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that these orders
satisfy 1 and 2.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, a simple non-example,
which I guess you could call it

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
a relation which satisfies 2
but not 1, is the following--

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:90%
so let's take our set S to be--

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.335 align:middle line:84%
and create the power set
of the natural numbers.

00:27:03.335 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And we define a relation A
less than B by A is less than B

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:90%
if A is a subset of B.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just defining a
relation on the power set--

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
A less than B if A
is a subset of B.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I shouldn't
even use less than,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
because this makes you think
that it's automatically

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:90%
an order.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's make it a
script-looking less than.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This relation is not
an order, though.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying "order,"
so we usually refer

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:90%
to this relation as an order.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear that
it satisfies 2.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Because A is a subset of
B. B is a subset of C.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Then A is a subset of C,
i.e., A is less than C.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.795 align:middle line:84%
It just follows
from the definition

00:28:43.795 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be
a subset of the other.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:84%
If A is a subset of B, that
means every element of A

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
is an element of B. If
B's an element of C, that

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
means every element of
B is an element of C.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, every element
of A is an element of C.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So this relation satisfies the
second transitive property,

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
satisfy the first.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I cannot always measure if one
thing is bigger than the other.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
set containing 0

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.905 align:middle line:84%
does not equal the
set containing 1.

00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But neither of
these things hold.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So for something to be an order,
or a set to be an ordered set,

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
it has to have this property
that I can always compare

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:90%
two elements of the set.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And for this relation,
which seems like it could be

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
an order-- it satisfies
the second property--

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
it does not satisfy the first
property because I cannot

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
always compare two subsets of
the natural numbers by saying

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:90%
one is a subset of the other.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So we just saw that.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
We have two sets
which are not equal,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
but one is not bigger
than the other.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And so one more
example, which again, I

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
will leave for you
to check that it does

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
satisfy conditions 1 and 2
just based on how it's defined.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
is the dictionary

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:24.767 align:middle line:84%
ordering of Q Cartesian product
Q. I think I wrote this down.

00:31:24.767 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you should know
what the Cartesian product

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:90%
is of two things.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But let me just recall
that I have two sets.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
The Cartesian
product of A and B,

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
this is the set of all
ordered pairs of elements

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.325 align:middle line:90%
from those sets.

00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So the dictionary
ordering of Q is what?

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So I need to define
this relation which

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I claim is an order.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So we'll say that a, b is less
than q, r if one of two things

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:84%
If either a is less
than q or a equals

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:90%
q, and b is less than r--

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
so dictionary ordering or
alphabetical ordering of Q.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
You can just check and see
which is smaller first.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
If they're both equal, then
you check the next letter,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and see which one's
smaller there.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So then this relation
that I've defined here

00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is in order on Q cross Q,
making it an ordered set.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
an ordered set is.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to an ordered
field in just a second.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But now, let me define what
I mean by this least upper

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what
sets R apart from Q.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll see in a minute
that both R and Q are ordered

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
fields, so that's not
what separates R from Q,

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:90%
the rational numbers.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.878 align:middle line:84%
But what does separate R from
Q is the second property,

00:33:49.878 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:90%
the least upper bound property.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So if I removed that
property, and just

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:84%
said there exists a unique
ordered field containing Q,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that would just be Q. We don't
need to add anything to it.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's the second property,
the least upper bound property,

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:18.030 align:middle line:90%
that really separates R from Q.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:84%
So to define this,
I need to define

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.370 align:middle line:90%
what a least upper bound is.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is all in the
setting of an ordered set.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Let S be an ordered set,
and let E be a subset of S.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to make a
series of definitions here.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
First, if there exists
an element of S--

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.463 align:middle line:84%
so not necessarily the set
I'm looking at, the subset

00:34:58.463 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at--

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
such that for all x in E, x
is less than or equal to b.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So here, I have this
order less than.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Less than or equal to means
just what it means in English,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:84%
either x is less than
b or x is equal to b,

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing with bigger
than or equal to, and so on.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But just keep in mind
that this ordered

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:90%
set is a general ordered set.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You could think of it as
the dictionary ordering

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.015 align:middle line:90%
on Q cross Q.

00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So if there exists a b
such that for all x in E,

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
x is less than or
equal to b, then

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:90%
we say that E is bounded above.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And this element of b
is an upper bound for E.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So if I can find some element
of my set bigger than everything

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in this set E, I say
E's bounded above,

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
and will be an upper bound.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I also have lower bounds.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
If there exists b in S
such that for all x in E,

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
b is smaller than or
equal to everything in E,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:84%
so b is less than or equal to x,
then we say E is bounded below,

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and b is a lower bound for E.
So b sits below everything in E.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we call an element in S
the least upper bound for E

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:90%
if it satisfies two conditions.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.663 align:middle line:84%
One is, if there's
a least upper bound,

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
there should at least
be an upper bound.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
b is an upper
bound for E, and it

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.480 align:middle line:84%
should be, in some sense, the
least of all upper bounds.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So if I take any
other upper bound,

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:84%
b sub 0 should sit
below that one.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So an element is the least
upper bound for a set

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.920 align:middle line:84%
E if it's an upper
bound and it's

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:84%
the least among all
other upper bounds.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It sits below every
other upper bound.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we also
say b0 is the supremum of E.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And we write b0
equals sup E. Now,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
this was having to
deal with upper bounds.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
We can also deal
with lower bounds

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:84%
or we also have a
definition corresponding

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:84%
to lower bounds for what would
be the greatest lower bound.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So we call an element of
S the greatest lower bound

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:84%
for E if two
conditions hold, which

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.612 align:middle line:84%
is kind of similar
to the conditions we

00:40:24.612 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:90%
had for at least upper bound.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Except now for lower bounds,
b0 is a lower bound for E,

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and it is the greatest
of all lower bounds.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:59.863 align:middle line:84%
If b is any lower
bound for E, then b

00:40:59.863 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to b0.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some Latin name
attached to least upper bound,

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
so there's a Latin name attached
to the greatest lower bound,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:90%
which we call the infimum.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We also call b0 the infimum
of E. And we write b0

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:40.210 align:middle line:90%
equals inf E.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have this mildly
interesting and complex

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:52.180 align:middle line:84%
definition, which means we
should look at some examples

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:90%
to get a feel for it.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
some simple examples.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's take our big
ordered set to be Z.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And let's take our set E
to be minus 1, 0, and 2.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So what about this guy?

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:90%
What is the supremum?

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.132 align:middle line:90%
What is the infimum?

00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So really, if I'm going
to prove or if I'm

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.800 align:middle line:84%
going to make a
statement something is

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:84%
equal to the supremum
or something is

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:84%
equal to the infimum, I should
actually give a proof of that,

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.470 align:middle line:84%
meaning if I say something
is an infimum or something is

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:84%
a supremum, then I
need to prove that it

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.900 align:middle line:84%
satisfies these two conditions
and these two conditions.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going
over examples,

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
so I will not give a
full proof of that.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.080 align:middle line:84%
This is just to get
some intuition going.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So now, first off, what would
be an upper bound for E?

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, 3, 4, 5--

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.890 align:middle line:84%
2 is an upper bound because
2 is bigger than or equal to

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:90%
everything in the set.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:34.990 align:middle line:90%
So 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:41.840 align:middle line:84%
these are all upper
bounds for this set E.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But what is the supremum,
meaning the least upper bound?

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:90%
That would be 2.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
If I take anything less
than 2 that's not an upper

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
bound because there's something
in the set bigger than that.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I take anything
bigger than that,

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
then this is going
to be bigger than 2,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.970 align:middle line:90%
but 2 is still an upper bound.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.520 align:middle line:90%
So 2 is the least upper bound.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Now what about lower bounds?

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
A lower bound would be minus
1, because minus 1 is less than

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.540 align:middle line:84%
or equal to
everything in the set.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But then so would be minus
2, minus 3, and so on.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest lower
bound would be minus 1.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:45.912 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.912 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Now let's do another example.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's now look at S,
the rational numbers,

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and let's take E to be a
set of rational numbers such

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that 0 is bigger
than or equal to--

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Q is between 0 and 1 inclusive.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So then what are
some upper bounds?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything in E is less
than or equal to 1.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:47.288 align:middle line:84%
So 1 is also a perfectly good
upper bound, 3/2, 5/4, 6/5,

00:45:47.288 --> 00:45:47.788 align:middle line:90%
7/6.

00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:51.820 align:middle line:90%


00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Anything bigger
than or equal to 1

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is also an upper
bound for this set.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And the least upper
bound would be 1.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to try to
draw Q for this set--

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:20.800 align:middle line:90%
let's not do that--

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I usually draw this line is
for the real number line,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
but let's imagine
it's Q. So everything

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.370 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to 1
sits above everything in E.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So everything bigger than or
equal to 1 is an upper bound,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and the least upper bound is 1.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.885 align:middle line:90%
What are some lower bounds?

00:46:46.885 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the set E is
bigger than or equal to 0.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.420 align:middle line:90%
So 0 is a lower bound.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So is minus 1/2, minus 1/3,
minus 1/4, minus 1/5, and so

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But anything less than or
equal to 0 is a lower bound.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Nothing bigger than 0
can be a lower bound

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.350 align:middle line:90%
because I can always find some--

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:84%
so this is not a proof, but
this is some explanation.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.663 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.663 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should
have also said this

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:33.990 align:middle line:84%
for the upper bound statement,
but anything bigger than 0

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:90%
is not a lower bound.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what if I take
some number, call it r,

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:53.580 align:middle line:84%
bigger than 0, and less than 1,
then r cannot be a lower bound

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:59.730 align:middle line:84%
because I can find something in
E less than r, namely r over 2.

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So therefore-- and we're
going to do some proofs where

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.280 align:middle line:84%
we actually have to
get our hands dirty

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and prove something is an
infimum or the supremum.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see how that
works, but for now, let's

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:20.040 align:middle line:90%
just go off of intuition.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.490 align:middle line:90%
The infimum of this set is 0.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:28.710 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, both of these
examples so far

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:37.140 align:middle line:84%
have this property that
both the sup and the inf

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:84%
belong to the set E
that I'm looking at.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But this is not necessarily
always the case.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So I could change this
slightly so our universe,

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the ordered set we're
looking in, is still Q,

00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and the subset E is now,
let's say, q is bigger than 0

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.140 align:middle line:90%
and less than 1.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Then sup of E is
still going to be 1,

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.020 align:middle line:84%
but this is not an
element of this set E.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It's of course an element of
S, this universe we're in,

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's not an
element of the set E.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the
infimum is still 0,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's not an element of E.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are
situations where you

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.400 align:middle line:84%
have a set, a subset
of an ordered set,

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.190 align:middle line:84%
which has an infimum
and supremum which

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:84%
do not exist in this smaller
set you're looking at.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not the
supremum or infimum

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.350 align:middle line:84%
may exist in the
universe that you're

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:84%
looking at in the bigger set
is an entirely different issue.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:09.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's the next issue
we're going to talk about.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So let me just reiterate
what we saw a minute ago.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can be in some
ordered set Z or Q,

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and the smaller set, which
we're taking the inf or sup in,

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.600 align:middle line:84%
it could belong to
the smaller set--

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, in this case
1 and 0 were in the set E--

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.740 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:84%
There is this case where
neither of them were in E.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if I put
less than or equal to here,

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:84%
then I would had the inf
in E and the sup not in E,

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and then vice versa.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So inf's and sup's of these
sets don't necessarily

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.430 align:middle line:84%
need to belong to that
set you're looking at.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But they at least
existed in the big set Q.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, big, ordered sets--

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.140 align:middle line:84%
so this ordered set that has
this property that the inf

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and sup of bounded
above and below sets

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:26.270 align:middle line:90%
exist in the bigger set always--

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.680 align:middle line:84%
is what we call an ordered
set with the least upper

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.305 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

00:51:30.305 --> 00:51:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So the definition--
ordered set S

00:51:52.790 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
has the least property if
every subset of S which

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:52.200 align:middle line:84%
is non-empty and bounded
above has a supremum in S.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So a set has the least
upper bound property

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.345 align:middle line:84%
if every non-empty bounded
set has a supremum.

00:52:58.345 --> 00:53:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we could come
up with simple examples

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:16.190 align:middle line:84%
of sets that do have the
least upper bound property.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
take S to be--

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is kind
of the simplest one--

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.362 align:middle line:84%
S with a single
element, let's say 0.

00:53:26.362 --> 00:53:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Here there's no
order to put on it.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Every element in here
is equal to itself.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, every
non-empty subset of S

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is just the whole
set, and the supremum

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:48.070 align:middle line:90%
would then be that one element.

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:52.375 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of the
silliest one you could do.

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you could
have two elements.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And then if E is a subset
of S, E is one of four guys.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.940 align:middle line:84%
If E is a non-empty subset
of S here, the order is 1,

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.830 align:middle line:90%
0 is less than 1.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If E is equal to 0,
then sup equals 0.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:31.630 align:middle line:84%
If E is equal to
1, sup E equals 1.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:40.625 align:middle line:84%
And if E is equal to 0, 1,
this implies sup E equals 1.

00:54:40.625 --> 00:54:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is in S, this
is in S, this is in S.

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So every subset of S which is
non-empty has a supremum in S.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So these are not the
most interesting examples

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.045 align:middle line:84%
of sets with this least
upper bound property.

00:55:01.045 --> 00:55:04.010 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So for example, maybe
a more interesting one

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:19.760 align:middle line:84%
would be if I take S to be,
let's say, with the dots here,

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:90%
minus 3, minus 2, minus 1.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
write it this way--

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:84%
minus 1, minus 2, minus
3, minus 4, and so on,

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:84%
with the usual ordering
coming from the integers.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So minus 2 is less than minus
1, minus 3 is less than minus 2,

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I claim this that does have
the least upper bound property.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if E is a subset
of S, E non-empty.

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.030 align:middle line:90%
In fact, both of these--

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:06.240 align:middle line:84%
this was always bounded
above because there's

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.320 align:middle line:90%
only two elements.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose
the biggest one, 1.

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Every subset of S is also
bounded above by minus 1.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So every subset of S is
automatically bounded above.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So I just need to check
that every non-empty set has

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:28.240 align:middle line:84%
a supremum in S. If E is a
subset of S and is non-empty,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.550 align:middle line:84%
then let me look at the set
minus E. This is a label.

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:84%
This is not meant to
mean anything always.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:41.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a label, which is
the set of elements minus x.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So I take all my
elements in E, which

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is a subset of the
negative integers.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I take their minuses.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:54.120 align:middle line:84%
This is now a subset
of the natural numbers.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And since by the
well-ordering property

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers,
there exists an element

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:21.590 align:middle line:84%
in minus E such that it
sits below everything

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:39.490 align:middle line:84%
in minus E for all x in E,
which means that for all x in E,

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.560 align:middle line:84%
x is less than or
equal to minus m.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'll let you think about
this just for a minute.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:58:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But so m is in minus E,
therefore minus m is in E.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And m less than or
equal to minus x

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:17.480 align:middle line:84%
for all x in E implies that for
all x in capital E is less than

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.180 align:middle line:90%
or equal to minus m.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I found
an element actually

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.660 align:middle line:84%
in the set capital
E that's bigger

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.390 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to
everything in the set.

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You can convince
yourself or write down

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a formal proof, if you like,
that this implies that minus

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.705 align:middle line:90%
m is therefore the supremum.

00:58:37.705 --> 00:58:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And so using this
trickery of going from one

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:10.650 align:middle line:84%
set that's bounded above to
a different set, a subset

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers, you
can also show, for example,

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Z has the least
upper bound property,

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.710 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to now
shorten because those

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:32.120 align:middle line:90%
are a lot of things to write.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.550 align:middle line:84%
LUBP, least upper
bound property--

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:38.252 align:middle line:84%
the integers also
have this property.

00:59:38.252 --> 00:59:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But the integers are not
all that interesting, again,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.700 align:middle line:84%
because I cannot divide by an
integer and stay in the set.

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.264 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.264 --> 00:59:54.240 align:middle line:84%
For what we want to do, we want
to be able to add, multiply,

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.610 align:middle line:90%
subtract, and divide.

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do that
in the integers.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.875 align:middle line:84%
We can do that in
the rational numbers.

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:04.920 align:middle line:90%


01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:15.180 align:middle line:84%
However, Q does not
have this property.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.090 align:middle line:90%


01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to prove this.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we're going to
prove in a couple of theorems

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
here, but let me just
put this out in front.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:42.230 align:middle line:90%


01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Q does not have the least
upper bound property.

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:48.640 align:middle line:90%


01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And where does this come from?

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:57.880 align:middle line:84%
This comes from the simple fact
which if you believe your--

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.206 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.206 --> 01:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to call
it Greek mythology,

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it's Greek
mythology strictly speaking--

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that some young guy discovered
that the square root of 2

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
is not a rational number and
then he got thrown off a cliff.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
That's who we have to
thank for showing us

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.350 align:middle line:84%
that Q is not
perfect, that it does

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.513 align:middle line:84%
have this algebraic property
which I just referenced--

01:01:26.513 --> 01:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you can
add, subtract, multiply,

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and divide and stay
within the set.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But it does not have square
roots of prime numbers,

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.450 align:middle line:90%
but square root of 2 in it.

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And this then manifests
itself in this least

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
upper bound property by giving
an example of a set which

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:56.231 align:middle line:84%
is bounded above which does not
have a supremum in the set Q.

01:01:56.231 --> 01:02:10.105 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if E is the
set of rational numbers--

01:02:10.105 --> 01:02:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I have not stated a theorem
yet, but I'm just telling you

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
what we're about to do--

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
if E is the subset
of rational numbers

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
where positive and q
squared is less than 2,

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
then sup E does not exist
in the rational numbers.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we
would have found

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
a set which is
bounded above which

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
does not have a supremum
in the rational numbers.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
rational numbers

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
do not have the least
upper bound property.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we're going to do.

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll prove-- state
a couple of theorems

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.550 align:middle line:90%
that spell all this out.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So first, I'm going to
prove a theorem about a what

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the supremum of such a
set would have to satisfy.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:20.810 align:middle line:90%
So if x is in Q--

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
this is a statement
of a theorem--

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
if x is in Q, and if x equals
the supremum of the set,

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
then x is bigger than or equal
to 1, and x squared equals 2.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%
So we're just saying--

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
don't try to take this as
necessarily contradicting what

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I wrote there because that was
not a statement of a theorem

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.420 align:middle line:90%
yet.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm stating this theorem that
if I have such a supremum in Q

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of the set, then it would
have to square and give me 2.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.440 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying such
an element exists.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying if there
is any element of Q that

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is the supremum
of this set, then

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
it has to be bigger than or
equal to 1, and it squares 2.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's give a proof of this.

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And because I don't want to
keep writing the set again,

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to use the notation
that I used in the comments.

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Let E be the set that
I'm interested in.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:57.490 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So this should be--

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:10.300 align:middle line:90%


01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:26.721 align:middle line:84%
and suppose we have
an element of Q

01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:32.130 align:middle line:90%
which is the supremum of E.

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So first off, what would
be one element of E?

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
What's one rational number
whose square is less than 2?

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%
1.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So since 1 is in E,
square is less than 2,

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and x is the supremum
of E, meaning

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
it's an upper bound
for E, it must

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
be bigger than or equal
to everything an E,

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.110 align:middle line:90%
in particular for 1.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%


01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
That implies x is bigger
than or equal to 1.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first part of
the theorem I want to prove.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.760 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
prove two inequalities

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to show that x squared
is actually equal to 2.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.160 align:middle line:90%
We're going to prove--

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
so this is a common
trick in analysis,

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that if I have two
things that I would

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
like to show equal to each
other, sometimes a way

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to show that is by showing one
is less than or equal to that.

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than
or equal to that.

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So one side is less than
or equal to the other side

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and vice versa, which
immediately implies

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
they must equal each other.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.310 align:middle line:90%


01:06:55.310 --> 01:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
we're going to do.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to now
prove that x squared

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:07.205 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 2.

01:07:07.205 --> 01:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%


01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll then prove that x squared
is less than or equal to 2,

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, x
squared equals 2.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, we'll do
this by contradiction.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.710 align:middle line:90%


01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume-- everything
else we've done so far

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is still true, but now we
want to prove this statement.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to assume
that this statement is false.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.720 align:middle line:90%


01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I assume that x
squared is less than 2.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:55.630 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.630 --> 01:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So we'll define a certain
rational number, h,

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
which is a smaller of
two rational numbers.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the
smaller of 1/2 and 2

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
minus x squared over
2 over 2x plus 1.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And let me just reiterate
this is less than 1

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:27.229 align:middle line:84%
because it's the smaller
of 1/2 and this number.

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:30.609 align:middle line:90%


01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you write a
proof, as you'll see,

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.410 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
magic that somehow

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%
this h does something magical.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.040 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly how
you come up with proofs.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
How it comes up is
you take an inequality

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that you want to mess with,
you fiddle around with it,

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and you see that if h
is given by something,

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.569 align:middle line:84%
then it breaks the
inequality or it

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
satisfies the inequality,
which whichever one you're

01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.600 align:middle line:90%
trying to do.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%


01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So since x squared is less
than 2, h is positive.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:16.649 align:middle line:84%
It's the minimum of a
1/2 and this number.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.439 align:middle line:90%
So if it's a 1/2, it's positive.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
If it's this one, then
it's still positive.

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
prove now is that x plus h

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
is in E. Its square
is less than 2.

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
This will give us
our contradiction,

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:41.689 align:middle line:84%
because x is supposed to
be an upper bound for E,

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, x is
supposed to be bigger

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:45.319 align:middle line:90%
than or equal to x plus h.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is x plus
a positive number.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.469 align:middle line:84%
x plus a positive
number is bigger than x.

01:09:51.469 --> 01:09:54.560 align:middle line:90%


01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.870 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to compute the square of
this and show it's less than 2.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where our
choice of h comes from.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.220 align:middle line:90%


01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
We compute that x
plus h squared--

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:18.715 align:middle line:84%
this is x squared plus
2xh plus h squared--

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%


01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:32.355 align:middle line:84%
now this is less than x
squared plus 2xh plus h.

01:10:32.355 --> 01:10:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:37.965 align:middle line:84%
Because h times h is less
than h since h is less than 1.

01:10:37.965 --> 01:10:40.830 align:middle line:90%


01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we chose
h to be less than 1,

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
so that I can get
rid of this square,

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and somehow just have a
single h floating around,

01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
which I can then use to
show x plus h is in E.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I write the
string of inequalities,

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
this thing is supposed to
be equal to the next thing.

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
This is not saying x plus
h squared is equal to what

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to write now.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to x squared
plus 2x plus 1 times h.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, h is the minimum
of these two numbers.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So h is going to be smaller
than or equal to this thing.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%


01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:35.455 align:middle line:84%
And so this is 2 minus
x squared over 2.

01:11:35.455 --> 01:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%


01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Write it this way, so I
had what I had before.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And then times 2 minus x
squared over 2, 2x plus 1.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.500 align:middle line:90%
So now some magic is happening.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
This cancels with that.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have 2 minus x squared
over 2, which is less than 2

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
minus x squared, so
less than x squared

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
plus 2 minus x squared, because
I took a 1/2 of it, equals 2.

01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:15.570 align:middle line:90%


01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So summarizing, we started
off with x plus h squared,

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and we showed it
was less than 2.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:26.940 align:middle line:90%


01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, x plus h is in E.
But if I have an element of E--

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%


01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.550 align:middle line:90%
let's see where are we on space.

01:12:47.550 --> 01:13:10.140 align:middle line:90%


01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But I have an element of
E which is bigger than x.

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that x is
not equal to the supremum

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of the set.

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember by definition,
something is the supremum

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
if it's an upper
bound for the set.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Something's not an upper bound
if you can find something

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
in the set bigger than b0.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is also a
good exercise to do

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
when you come across
a new definition,

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
is to try and negate
it to understand

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:49.550 align:middle line:90%
it a little bit better.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So let me write here next to
b is an upper bound for E--

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:57.365 align:middle line:84%
let me write what this
means, actually, here.

01:13:57.365 --> 01:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%


01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.755 align:middle line:90%
Let me write this here.

01:14:02.755 --> 01:14:05.540 align:middle line:90%


01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:10.095 align:middle line:84%
b0 is not-- so what's the
negation of being an upper

01:14:10.095 --> 01:14:10.595 align:middle line:90%
bound--

01:14:10.595 --> 01:14:14.570 align:middle line:90%


01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:21.770 align:middle line:84%
so not an upper bound for
E if there exists an x in E

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:25.520 align:middle line:90%
such that x is bigger than b0.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.300 align:middle line:90%


01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.550 align:middle line:90%
So we have found an element--

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
so going back to
our proof, we have

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
found an element
of our set E which

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than x, which
means that x is not

01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
the supremum of E,
which is a contradiction

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:43.390 align:middle line:90%
to our assumption.

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
These are assumptions
for the theorem.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:49.435 align:middle line:90%
So we're always assuming this.

01:14:49.435 --> 01:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%


01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is a contradiction.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:15:00.370 align:middle line:90%


01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.655 align:middle line:84%
Thus our assumption
that x squared

01:15:03.655 --> 01:15:05.530 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 2--

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean less than 2, which is
different from our assumptions

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.860 align:middle line:90%
of the theorem, is false.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:58.020 align:middle line:90%


01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, we want to prove
that x squared equals 2.

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So we now show x
squared equals 2.

01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:16.240 align:middle line:90%


01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.878 align:middle line:84%
Since x squared-- so this
is not exactly the proof.

01:16:19.878 --> 01:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Just I'm going to rewrite
it a little differently

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:30.360 align:middle line:84%
so it's maybe clear that instead
of showing also x squared is

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to 2, which
we know the less than cannot

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
happen, let's just show that x
squared cannot be bigger than

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
2.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:45.935 align:middle line:90%


01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Since x squared is bigger
than or equal to 2,

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
this means either
x squared equals 2,

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
which we want to show, or
x squared is bigger than 2.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%


01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:01.625 align:middle line:90%
So let's rule out this case.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:11.786 align:middle line:90%


01:17:11.786 --> 01:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We now show that the case x
squared bigger than 2 cannot

01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:16.870 align:middle line:90%
hold.

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:18.040 align:middle line:90%
So suppose otherwise.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this-- this is going

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to be a proof by
contradiction, as well.

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess when I say x squared
bigger than 2 cannot hold,

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm also saying x squared must
be less than or equal to 2.

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so let's
show this cannot hold.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do this
by contradiction, as well.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.300 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
show this cannot hold.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume
that it does hold.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:50.550 align:middle line:90%


01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
negation of what we

01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
want to show, which
is this statement,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that x squared greater
than 2 does not hold.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So assume x squared
is bigger than 2.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.043 align:middle line:90%


01:18:04.043 --> 01:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do is we're

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
going to find an upper
bound for the set

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:11.235 align:middle line:84%
E which is strictly
smaller than x.

01:18:11.235 --> 01:18:14.670 align:middle line:90%


01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do that
next time because I think

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to run out of time.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So I hate to stop
the proof here,

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
but we'll finish this
in the next lecture.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:39.480 align:middle line:90%

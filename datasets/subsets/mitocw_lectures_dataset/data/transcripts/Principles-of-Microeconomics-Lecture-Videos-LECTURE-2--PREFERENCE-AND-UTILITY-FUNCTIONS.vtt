JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today we're going

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.790
to start talking about what's
underneath the demand curve.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.490
So basically, what
we did last time,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.590
and what you did in
section on Friday

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.150
is talk about sort
of the workhorse

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.528
model of economics, which
is supply and demand model.

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:28.820
And we always start the class
with that, because that's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.680
the model in the course.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.800
But I think as any good sort
of scientists and inquisitive

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.957
minds, you're probably
immediately asking, well,

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:38.040
where do these supply and
demand curves come from?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.895
They don't just come
out of thin air.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.020
How do we think about them?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.100
Where do they come from?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.225
And that's what we'll spend
basically the first 1/2

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.000
of the course going through.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.820
And so we're going to start
today with the demand curve,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.670
and the demand curve is
going to come from how

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.930
consumers make choices, OK?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.910
And that will help us
drive the demand curve.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.090
Then we'll turn next
to supply curve, which

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.647
will come from how firms
make production decisions.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.230
But let's start with
the demand curve,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.688
and we're going to
start by talking

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:13.000
about people's preferences, and
then the utility functions, OK?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.270
So our model of
consumer decision making

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.093
is going to be a model
of utility maximization.

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.010
That's going to be our
fundamental-- remember,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.080
this course is all about
constrain maximization.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
Our model today is going to be
a model of utility maximization.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830
And this model's going
to have two components.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.330
There's going to be
consumer preferences, which

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.640
is what people want,
and there's going

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.580
to be a budget constraint,
which is what they can afford.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.600
And we're going to put
these two things together.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.280
We're going to maximize people's
happiness, or their choice--

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.800
or their happiness
given their preferences,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.367
subject to the budget
constraint they face.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:56.450
And that's going to be the
constraint maximization

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.510
exercise that actually,
through the magic of economics,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.997
is going to yield
the demand curve,

00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:03.080
and yield a very sensible
demand curve that you'll

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.470
understand intuitively.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.289
Now, so what we're going to
do is do this in three steps.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110
Step one-- over the
next two lectures.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.510
Step one is we'll talk
about preferences, how

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.410
do we model people's tastes.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.120
We'll do that today.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.460
Step two is we'll talk
about how we translate this

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.280
to utility function,
how we mathematically

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.580
represent people's preferences
in utility function.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.470
We'll do that today as well.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.830
And then next time, we'll talk
about the budget constraints

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.450
that people face.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.670
So today, we're going to
talk about the max demand.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.220
Next time we'll talk about
the budget constraint.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.500
That means today's
lecture is quite fun.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.827
Today's lecture is about
unconstrained choice.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:44.910
We're not going to worry
at all about what you can

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.270
afford, what anything costs.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.270
We're not going to worry
about what things cost.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.562
We're not going to worry
about what you can afford, OK?

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:53.340
Today's the lecture where
you won the lottery, OK?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.390
You won the lottery.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.040
Money is no object.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.368
How do you think about
what you want, OK?

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:00.660
Next time, we'll say, well,
you didn't win the lottery.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.040
In fact, as we learn
later in the semester,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.340
no one wins the lottery.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.270
It's an incredibly bad deal.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.240
But next time, we'll impose
the budget constraints.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.900
But for today, we're just going
to ignore that and talk about

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.560
what do you want, OK?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.490
And to start this,
we're going to start

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.140
with a series of
preference assumptions.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.380
A series-- remember, as
I talked about last time,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.375
models rely on
simplifying assumptions.

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:32.250
Otherwise, we could
never write down a model.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.380
It'll go on forever, OK?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.230
And the key question is,
are those simplifying

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.480
assumptions sensible?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.240
Do they do violence to reality
in a way which makes you not

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.097
believe the model,
or are they roughly

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:45.930
consistent with reality
in a way that allows

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.700
you to go on with the model?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.530
OK?

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.270
And we're going to pose three
preference assumptions, which

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.720
I hope will not violate your
sense of reasonableness.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.090
The first is completeness.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.560
What I mean by that is
you have preferences

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.500
over any set of goods
you might choose from.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.900
You might be indifferent.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.060
You might say, "I
like A as much as B,"

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.303
but you can't say, "I don't
care," or, "I don't know."

00:04:15.303 --> 00:04:16.470
You can say, "I don't care."

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.303
That's indifference.

00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:18.589
You can't say, "I don't know."

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.964
You can't literally
say, "I don't

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:21.350
know how I feel about this."

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.570
You might say you're
indifferent to two things,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.600
but you won't say, "I don't know
how I feel about something."

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.000
That's completeness, OK?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.550
The second is the assumption
we've all become familiar

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.682
with since kindergarten
math, which is transitivity.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.190
If you prefer A to B and B
to C, you prefer A to C, OK?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.142
That's kind of--

00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:47.350
I'm sure that's pretty clear.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.000
You've done this a
lot in other classes.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.330
So these two are sort
of standard assumptions

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.550
you might make in
any math class.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.710
The third assumption is the one
where the economics comes in,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.730
which is the assumption
of nonsatiation

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.580
or the assumption
of more is better.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.210
In this class, we
will assume more

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.860
is always better than less, OK?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.780
We'll assume more
is better than less.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.390
Now, to be clear,
we're not going

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.830
to say that the
next unit makes you

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.182
equally happy as the last unit.

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:25.140
In fact, I'll talk about
that in a few minutes.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.223
Well, in fact, the next
unit makes you less happy.

00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:29.810
But we will say you
always want more,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.710
that faced with the
chance of more or less,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.520
you'll always be
happier with more, OK?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.518
And that's the nonsatiation
assumption, OK?

00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:39.560
And I'll talk about that
some during the lecture,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.185
but that's sort of what's going
to give our models their power.

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.068
That's a sort of new
economics assumption.

00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:46.610
That's going to give-- beyond
your typical math assumptions--

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.970
this is going to give our
models their power, OK?

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.590
So that's our assumptions.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.800
So armed with those,
I want to start

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.992
with a graphical
representation of preferences.

00:05:57.992 --> 00:06:00.200
I want to graphically
represent people's preferences,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.155
and I'll do so through something
we call indifference curves.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.150
Indifference curves, OK?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.230
These are-- indifference curves
are basically preference maps.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.080
Essentially, indifference
curves are graphical maps

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.850
of preferences, OK?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.430
So for example, suppose your
parents gave you some money

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.160
to begin the semester, and you
spent that money on two things.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.790
Your parents are rich.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.957
They gave you tons of money.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:36.570
You spent your money on
two things, buying pizza

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.930
or eating cookies, OK?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.433
So consider preferences
between pizza and cookies.

00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:44.850
That's your two
things you can do.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.050
Once again, this is
a constrained model.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.717
Obviously, in life, you can do a
million things with your money.

00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:51.528
But it turns out, if we consider
the contrast between doing

00:06:51.528 --> 00:06:53.070
two different things
with your money,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.737
you get a rich set
of intuition that you

00:06:54.737 --> 00:06:57.210
can apply to a much more
multi-dimensional decision

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.990
case.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.210
So let's start with a two
dimensional decision case.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.127
You've got your money.

00:07:01.127 --> 00:07:04.350
Either you can have pizza
or you can have cookies, OK?

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.960
Now, consider three choices, OK?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.560
Choice A is two
pizzas and one cookie.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:21.230
Choice B is one pizza
and two cookies,

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.310
and choice C is two
pizzas, two cookies.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.010
OK, that's the three
packages I want to compare.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.360
And I am going to assume--

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.920
and I'll mathematically
rationalize in a few minutes--

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.830
but for now, I'm
going to assume you

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.293
are indifferent between
these two packages.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.710
I'm going to assume
you're equally

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.530
happy with two slices of pizza
and one cookie or two cookies

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.620
and one slice of pizza, OK?

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.730
I'm going to assume that.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.790
But I'm also going
to assume you prefer

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.770
option C to both of these.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.360
In fact, I'm going
to assume that,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.290
because that is what more
is better gives you, OK?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.910
So you're indifferent
between this.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.410
This indifference doesn't come
from any property I wrote up.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.520
That's an assumption.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.040
That's just-- for this
case, I'm assuming that.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.208
This comes to the third
property I wrote up there.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.000
You prefer package C
because more is always

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
better than less, OK?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.370
So now, let's graph
your preferences,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.950
and we do so in figure
2-1, OK, in the handout.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.430
OK, so here's your
indifference curve.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.330
So we've graphed on the
x-axis your number of cookies,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.630
on the y-axis
slices of pizza, OK?

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.809
Now, you have-- we've graphed
the three choices I laid here,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.720
choice A, which is
two slices of pizza

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.049
and one cookie, choice B,
which is two cookies and one

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.530
slice of pizza, and choice
C, which is two of both.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.817
And I've drawn on this graph
your indifference curves.

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.400
The way your
indifference curves looks

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.610
is there's one indifference
curve between A and B,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.940
because those are the points
among which you're indifferent.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.430
So what an indifference
curve represents

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.000
is all combinations of
consumption among which

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.240
you are indifferent.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.030
That's why we call it
indifference curve.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.530
So an indifference
curve, which will

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.460
be sort of one of the big
workhorses of this course,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.070
an indifference curve represents
all combinations along which

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.123
you are in different.

00:09:13.123 --> 00:09:15.040
You're indifferent between
A and B. Therefore,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.580
they lie on the same curve, OK?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.395
So that's sort of our preference
map, our indifference curves.

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:24.770
And these indifference
curves are

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.670
going to have four
properties, four properties

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.730
that you have to--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.817
that follow
naturally from this--

00:09:31.817 --> 00:09:32.900
it's really three and 1/2.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.108
The third and fourth are
really pretty much the same,

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:36.700
but I like to write
them out as four.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.180
Four properties that follow from
these underlying assumptions--

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.290
Property one is, consumers
prefer higher indifference

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.610
curves.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:53.910
Consumers prefer higher
indifference curves, OK?

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.617
And that's just all
from more is better.

00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:57.450
That is, an indifference
curve that's higher

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.630
goes through package that has
at least as much of one thing

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.220
and more of the other thing.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.290
Therefore, you prefer it, OK?

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.550
So as indifference curve shifts
out, people are happier, OK?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.580
So on that higher
indifference curve, point C,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.170
you are happier
than points A and B,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.030
because more is better, OK?

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:24.610
The second is that indifference
curves never cross.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.330
Indifference curves
never cross, OK?

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.127
Actually, that's
third, actually.

00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:36.460
I want to come to that in order.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.625
Second-- third is the
indifference curves never--

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.750
Second is indifference
curves are downward sloping.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.582
Second is indifference
curves are downward sloping.

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:49.290
Indifference curves
are downward sloping.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.260
Let's talk about that first, OK?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.120
That simply comes from the
principle of nonsatiation.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.370
So look at figure 2-2.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.120
Here's an upward sloping
indifference curve, OK?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.300
Why does that violate the
principle of nonsatiation?

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.425
Why does that violate that?

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:08.220
Yeah.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.880
AUDIENCE: Either, if you're--
either you're less happy with

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.680
you have more cookies, or you're
less happy if you have more

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.130
pizza.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.378
And like there's-- and
that violates nonsatiation.

00:11:20.378 --> 00:11:21.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.610
So basically, you're
indifferent-- on this curve,

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.290
you're indifferent with one
of each and two of each.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.332
You can't be indifferent.

00:11:26.332 --> 00:11:28.440
Two of each has got to be
better than one of each.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.065
So an upward sloping
indifference curve

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.800
would violate nonsatiation.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.140
So that's the second property
of indifference curve.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.807
The third property
of indifference curve

00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:38.310
is the indifference
curves never cross, OK?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.020
We could see that
in figure 2-3, OK?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.700
Someone else tell
me why this violates

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.036
the properties I wrote up there,
indifference curves crossing.

00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:49.423
Yeah.

00:11:49.423 --> 00:11:51.340
AUDIENCE: Because B and
C [is strictly better.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.548
JONATHAN GRUBER: What's that?

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:54.548
AUDIENCE: Because B and
C, B is strictly better.

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.006
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because the
B and C, B is strictly better.

00:11:57.006 --> 00:11:57.757
That's right.

00:11:57.757 --> 00:11:59.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.250
JONATHAN GRUBER:
But they're also

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.633
both on the same
curve as A. So you're

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:06.050
saying they're both-- you're
indifferent with A for both B

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.690
and C, but you can't be, because
B is strictly better than C.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.300
So it violates transitivity, OK?

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.430
So the problem with
crossing indifference curves

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.420
is they violate transitivity.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.570
And then finally,
the fourth is sort

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.610
of a cute extra
assumption, but I

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.860
think it's important
to clarify, which

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.070
is that there is
only one indifference

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.380
curve through every
possible consumption bundle,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.620
only one IC through
every bundle.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.270
OK, you can't have two
indifference curves going

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.120
through the same bundle, OK?

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.010
And that's because
of completeness.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.910
If you have two
indifference curves

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.327
going through the
same bundle, you

00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:52.619
wouldn't know how you felt, OK?

00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:54.785
So there can only be one
going through every bundle,

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:56.300
because you know how you feel.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.550
You may feel indifferent,
but you know how you feel.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.640
You can't say I don't know, OK?

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.240
So that's sort of
a extra assumption

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.420
that sort of completes the
link to the properties, OK?

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.160
So that's basically how
indifference curves work.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.472
Now, I find-- when I took
this course, before you were--

00:13:15.472 --> 00:13:17.180
god, maybe before your
parents were born,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.305
I don't know, certainly
before you guys were born--

00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:21.562
when I took this course,
I found this course

00:13:21.562 --> 00:13:23.270
full of a lot of light
bulb moments, that

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.290
is, stuff was just
sort of confusing,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.600
and then boom, an example
really made it work for me.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.030
And the example that made
indifference curves work to me

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.160
was actually doing
my first UROP.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.805
When my UROP was with a grad
student, and that grad student

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.930
had to decide whether he
was going to accept a job.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.120
He had a series of job
offers, so he had to decide.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.200
And basically, he said, "Here's
the way I'm thinking about it.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.230
I am indifferent-- I
have an indifference map

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.950
and I care about two things.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.150
I care about school
location and I

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.005
care about economics
department quality.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.140
I care about the quality
of my colleagues,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.360
and the research it's done
there, and the location."

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.880
And basically, he
had two offers.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.210
One was from Princeton,
which he put up here.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.960
No offense to New
Jerseyans, but Princeton

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.880
as a young single person sucks.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.220
OK, fine when you're married
and have kids, but deadly

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.690
as a young single person.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.460
And the other-- so
that's Princeton.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.470
Down here was Santa Cruz.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.067
OK, awesome.

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:15.900
[INAUDIBLE] is the most
beautiful university

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.430
in America, OK?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.290
But not as good an
economics department.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.090
And he decided he was roughly
indifferent between the two.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.110
But he had a third offer
from the IMF, which

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.217
is a research
institution in DC, which

00:14:29.217 --> 00:14:30.800
has-- he had a lot
of good colleagues,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.660
and DC is way better than
Princeton, New Jersey,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.460
even though it's not
as good as Santa Cruz.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.960
So he decided he would take
the offer at the IMF, OK?

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.590
Even though the IMF had worse
colleagues than Princeton

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.750
and worse location
than Santa Cruz,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.000
it was still better in
combination of the two of them,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.520
given his preferences.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.270
And that's how he used
indifference curves

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.360
to make his decision, OK?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.625
So that's sort of an
example of applying it.

00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:56.000
Once again, no
offense to the New

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.320
Jerseyans in the room, of
which I am one, but believe me,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.550
you'd rather be in Santa Cruz.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.990
OK, so now, let's
go from preferences

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.363
to utility functions.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.580
OK, so now, we're going to move
from preferences, which we've

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.650
represented graphically, to
utility functions, which we're

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.067
going to represent
mathematically.

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.358
Remember, I want you understand,
everything this course

00:15:23.358 --> 00:15:25.590
at three levels,
graphically, mathematically,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.380
and most importantly of
all, intuitively, OK?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.360
So graphic is
indifference curves.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.550
Now we come to the
mathematical representation,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.890
which is utility function, OK?

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.740
And the idea is that every
individual, all of you

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.370
in this room, have a
stable, well behaved,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.500
underlying mathematical
representation

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.912
of your preferences, which
we call utility function.

00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:50.120
Now, once again, that's
going to be very complicated,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.040
your preference over
lots of different things.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.495
We're going to make things
simple by writing out

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.570
a two dimensional representation
for now of your indifference

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.200
curve.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.480
We're going to say, how
do we act mathematically

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.950
represent your feelings
about pizza versus cookies?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.550
OK?

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.508
Imagine that's all you
care about in the world,

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:07.670
is pizza and cookies.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.590
How do we mathematically
represent that?

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.750
So for example, we
could write down

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.050
that your utility function
is equal to the square root

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.268
of the number of slices of pizza
times the number of cookies.

00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:19.310
We could write that down.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.150
I'm not saying that's right.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.190
I'm not saying it works
for anyone in this room

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.400
or even everyone this room,
but that is a possible way

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.110
to represent utility, OK?

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.340
What this would say--

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.270
this is convenient.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.580
We will use-- we'll end up
using square root form a lot

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.997
for utility functions and a
lot of convenient mathematical

00:16:35.997 --> 00:16:36.820
properties.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.358
And it happens to jive
with our example, right?

00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:41.900
Because in this example, you're
indifferent between two pizza

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.140
and one cookie or one
pizza and two cookie.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.762
They're both square root of 2.

00:16:45.762 --> 00:16:47.470
And you prefer two
pizza and two cookies.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.510
That's two, OK?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.710
So this gives you a high utility
for two pizza and two cookies,

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:59.050
OK, than one pizza
and two cookie,

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.080
or two pizza and one cookie.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.520
So now, the question
is, what does this mean?

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.670
What is utility?

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.000
Well, utility doesn't
actually mean anything.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.140
There's not really a thing
out there called utiles OK?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.930
In other words, utility
is not a cardinal concept.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.930
It is only an ordinal concept.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.290
You cannot say your
utility, you are--

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.470
you cannot literally say,
"My utility is x% higher than

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.230
your utility," but
you can rank them.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.140
So we're going to assume
that utility can be ranked

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.840
to allow you to rank choices.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.940
Even if generally, we
might slip some and sort

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.120
of pretend utility is cardinal
for some cute examples,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.910
but by and large,
we're going to think

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.630
of utility as purely ordinal.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.503
It's just a way to
rank your choices.

00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:47.170
It's just when you
have a set of choices

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.900
out there over many dimensions--
like if your choice in life

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.770
was always over one dimension
and more was better,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.520
it would always be
easy to rank it, right?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.810
You'd never have a problem.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.605
Once your choice is over
more than one dimension,

00:17:58.605 --> 00:17:59.980
now if you want
to rank them, you

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.600
need some way to combine them.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.220
That's what this function does.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.830
It allows you essentially to
weight the different elements

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.600
of your consumption
bundle, so you

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.520
can rank them when it
comes time to choose, OK?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.730
Now, this is obviously
incredibly simple,

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.910
but it turns out to be
amazingly powerful in explaining

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.665
real world behavior, OK?

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:23.040
And so what I want
to do today is

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.628
work with the underlying
mathematics of utility,

00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:26.670
and then we'll come back.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.087
We'll see in the
next few lectures

00:18:28.087 --> 00:18:31.350
how it could actually be
used to explain decisions.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.000
So a key concept we're going
to talk about in this class

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.160
is marginal utility.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.780
Marginal utility is
just a derivative

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.180
of the utility function with
respect to one of the elements.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.840
So the marginal utility
for cookies, of cookies,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.380
is the utility of
the next cookie,

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.670
given how many
cookies you've had.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.350
This class is going
to be very focused

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.140
on marginal decision making.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.260
In economics, it's all about how
you think about the next unit.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.110
Turns out, that makes
life a ton easier.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.860
Turns out, it's way
easier to say, "Do you

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.380
want the next cookie," than to
say, "How many cookies do you

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.770
want?"

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.270
Because if you want
the next cookie,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.280
that's sort of a very
isolated decision.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.840
You say, OK, I had
this many cookies.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.310
Do I want the next cookie?

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.510
Whereas before you start
eating, if you say,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.010
how many cookies
do you want, that's

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.900
sort of a harder,
more global decision.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.570
So we're going to focus on
this stepwise decision making

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.380
process of do you want the
next unit, the next cookie,

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.360
or the next slice of pizza, OK?

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.660
And the key feature
of utility functions

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.120
we'll work with
throughout the semester

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:39.210
is that they will feature
diminishing marginal utility.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.440
Marginal utility will fall
as you have more of a good.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.540
The more of a good
you've had, the less

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.690
happiness you'll derive
from the next unit, OK?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.250
Now, we can see that
graphically in figure 2-4.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.400
Figure 2-4 graphs on
the x-axis the number

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.090
of cookies holding
constant pizza.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.170
So let's say you're
having two pizza slices,

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.630
and you want to say, what's my
benefit from the next cookie?

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.330
And on the left axis,
violating what I just

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.108
said like 15 seconds
ago, we graph utility.

00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:15.400
Now, once again, the utile
numbers don't mean anything.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.110
It's just to give
you an ordinal sense.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.050
What you see here is that
if you have 1 cookie,

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.412
your utility is 1.4,
square root of 2 times 1.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:26.870
If you have 2
cookies, your utility

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.990
goes up to square
root of 4, which is 2.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.450
You are happier with
2 cookies, but you

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.540
are less happy from the second
cookie than the first cookie,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.490
OK?

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.140
And you could see
that in figure--

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.690
if you flip back and
forth between 2-4 and 2-5,

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.550
you can see that, OK?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.970
The first cookie, going
from 0 to 1 cookie,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.040
gave you one-- so in
this case, we're now

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.990
graphing the marginal utility.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.300
So figure 2-4 is the
level of utility,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.713
which is not really something
you can measure, in fact.

00:20:58.713 --> 00:21:00.380
Figure 2-5 is something
you can measure,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.210
which is marginal utility,
what's your happiness--

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.752
and we'll talk about
measuring this--

00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:04.700
from the next cookie.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:13.150
You see, the first cookie gives
you a utility increment of 1.4,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.740
OK?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.550
You go from utility of
0 to utility of 1.4.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.190
The next cookie gives you
utility increment of 0.59.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.340
OK, you go from utility
of 1.41 to utility of 2.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.770
The next cookie gives
utility increment of 0.45,

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.090
the square root of 3.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.720
So now we flip back
to the previous page.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.770
We're going from the
square root of 4,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.395
we're going from the
square root of 4--

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:36.920
I'm sorry-- to the
square root of 6.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.880
Square root of 6 is only 0.45
more than the square root of 4,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.450
and so on.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.300
So each additional cookie
makes you less and less happy.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.400
It makes you happier, it has
to, because more is better,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.540
but it makes you less
and less happy, OK?

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.680
And this makes sense.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.420
Just think about
any decision life

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.100
starting with
nothing of something

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.520
and having the first
one, slice of pizza,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.380
a cookie, deciding on
which movie to go to.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.120
The first movie, the one
you want to see the most,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.760
is going to make you
happier than the one you

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.182
want to see not quite as much.

00:22:11.182 --> 00:22:12.640
The first cookie
when you're hungry

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.808
will make you happier
than the second cookie.

00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:16.600
The first slice of
pizza make you happier--

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.440
Now, you may be
close to indifferent.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.565
Maybe the second slice of
pizza makes you almost as

00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:21.950
happy as the first.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.070
But the first will
make you happier, OK?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.007
If you think about--

00:22:25.007 --> 00:22:26.590
that's really sort
of that first step.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.590
You were hungry, and that first
one makes you feel happier.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.592
Now, but you got to remember,
you always want more cookies.

00:22:33.592 --> 00:22:35.050
Now, you might say,
"Wait a second.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.050
This is stupid.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.102
Once I've had 10 cookies,
I'm going to barf.

00:22:38.102 --> 00:22:40.060
The 11th cookie can
actually make me worse off,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.140
because I don't like barfing."

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.530
But in economics,
we have to remember,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.240
you don't have to
eat the 11th cookie.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.812
You can give it away.

00:22:48.812 --> 00:22:50.770
So if like say, you don't
want the 11th cookie,

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.370
you can save it for later.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.040
You can give it to a friend.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.660
So you always want it.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.000
In the worst case,
you throw it out.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.762
It can't make you worse off, it
can only make you better off.

00:23:01.762 --> 00:23:03.970
And that's what our sort of
more is better assumption

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:04.470
comes from.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.053
Obviously, the limit-- you know,
if you get a million cookies,

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.220
your garbage can gets full.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.190
You have no friends
to give them to.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.860
I understand at the limit,
these things fall apart, OK?

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.780
But that's the basic
idea of more is better

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.180
and the basic idea of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.780
OK, any questions about that?

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.280
Yeah.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.950
AUDIENCE: Can the utility
function ever be negative?

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.325
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Utility function

00:23:22.325 --> 00:23:24.970
can never be negative
because we have-- well,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.328
utility-- once again, utility
is not an ordinal concept.

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:28.870
You can set up
utility functions such

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.250
that the number is negative.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.310
You can set that up.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.360
OK, the marginal utility
is always positive.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.890
You always get some
benefit from the next unit.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.890
Utility, once again, the
measurement's relevant.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:39.620
So it could be negative.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.440
You could set it up--

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.080
I could write my utility
function like this,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.330
you know, something like that.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.390
So it could be negative.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.430
That's just a sort
of scaling factor.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.190
But marginal utility
is always positive.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.040
You're always happier,
or it's non-negative.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.930
You're always happier
or at least indifferent

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.570
to getting the next unit.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.253
Yeah.

00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:56.920
AUDIENCE: So when
you're looking at 2-5,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.545
if you get like a
fraction of a cookie,

00:23:58.545 --> 00:24:02.497
is the marginal utility
still going to go up?

00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:04.080
JONATHAN GRUBER: I'm
sorry, you look--

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.528
figure 2-5-- no, the
marginal is going to go down.

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.570
Each fraction of a cookie,
the marginal utility--

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.770
marginal utility is
always diminishing.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.270
AUDIENCE: So if you
start with zero,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.762
and you get 1/2 a cookie
based on this graph--

00:24:13.762 --> 00:24:16.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, it's
really hard to do it from zero.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.095
That's really tricky.

00:24:17.095 --> 00:24:19.050
It's sort of much easier
to start from one.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.530
So corner solutions, we'll
talk about corner solutions

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.910
in this class, they get ugly.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.220
Think of it starting from one.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.090
Starting with that first cookie,
every fraction of a cookie

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.700
makes you happier, but less and
less happy with each fraction.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.930
Good question.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.190
All right, good questions.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.510
All right, so now,
let's talk about--

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.050
let's flip back from the
math to the graphics,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.180
and talk about where
indifference curves come from.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.510
I just drew them out.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.630
But in fact,
indifference curves are

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.910
the graphical representation
of what comes out

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.000
of utility function, OK?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.980
And indeed, the slope
of the indifference

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:58.470
curve, we're going to call the
marginal rate of substitution,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.970
the rate essentially
at which you're

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.000
willing to substitute
one good for the other.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.130
The rate at which you're willing
to substitute cookies for pizza

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.250
is your marginal
rate of substitution.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.180
And we'll define that as the
slope of the indifference

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.780
curve, delta p over delta c.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.700
That is your marginal
rate of substitution.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.540
Literally, the
indifference curve

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.915
tells you the rate at which
you're willing to substitute.

00:25:23.915 --> 00:25:25.800
You just follow
along and say, "Look,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.240
I'm willing to give up--"

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.920
So in other words, if you look
at figure 2-6, you say, "Look,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.480
I'm indifferent between
point A to point B.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.800
One slice of pizza--

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.290
I'm sorry-- one cookie
and four slices of pizza

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.170
is the same to me as two cookies
and two slices of pizza."

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.480
Why is it the same?

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.730
Because they both give me
utility square root of four,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.250
right?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.512
So given this mathematical--

00:25:48.512 --> 00:25:49.470
I'm not saying you are.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.160
I'm saying, given this
mathematical representation,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.600
OK, you are indifferent
between point A and point

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.730
B. So what that
says-- and what's

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.390
the slope with the
indifference curve?

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.170
What's the arc slope
between point A and point B?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.210
The slope is negative 2.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.570
So your marginal rate of
substitution is negative 2.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.810
You are indifferent, OK?

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.140
You are indifferent
between 1, 4 and 2, 2.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.040
Therefore, you're willing
to substitute or give away

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.200
two slices of pizza
to get one cookie.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:29.310
Delta p delta c
is negative 2, OK?

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.860
Now, it turns out you can
define the marginal rate

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.500
of substitution over any
segment of indifference curve,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.960
and what's interesting
is it changes.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.160
It diminishes.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.340
Look what happens when we
move from two pizzas and two

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.608
cookies, from
point B to point C.

00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:46.150
Now the marginal
rate of substitution

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.030
is only negative of 1/2.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.790
Now I'm only willing to
give up one slice of pizza

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.410
to get two cookies.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.260
What's happening?

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.260
First, I was willing give
up two slices of pizza

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.120
to get one cookie.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.730
Now I'm only willing to
give up one slice of pizza

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.050
to get two cookies.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.050
What's happening?

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.550
Yeah.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.930
AUDIENCE: You don't
want a cookie as much?

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.130
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because of?

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.970
AUDIENCE: Diminishing
marginal utility.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.050
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.810
Diminishing margin
utility has caused

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.730
the marginal rate
of substitution

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.883
itself to diminish.

00:27:12.883 --> 00:27:15.300
For those who are really kind
of better at math than I am,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.790
it turns out technically,
mathematically,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.820
marginal utility isn't
always diminishing.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.030
You can draw up cases.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.075
MRS is always diminishing.

00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.200
So you can think of marginal
as always diminishing.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.140
It's fine for this class.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.690
When you get to higher
level math and economics,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.898
you'll see marginal utility
doesn't have to diminish.

00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:32.650
MRS has to diminish, OK?

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.015
MRS is always diminishing.

00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:36.640
As you go along the
indifference curve,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.740
that slope is
always falling, OK?

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.400
So basically, what
we can right now

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.690
is how the MRS relates
to utility function.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.680
Our first sort of
mind-blowing result

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.830
is that the MRS is
equal to the negative

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.470
of the marginal
utility of cookies

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.730
over the marginal
utility of pizza.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.240
That's our first key definition.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.130
It's equal to the negative
of the marginal utility

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.730
of the good on the x-axis
over the marginal utility

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.390
of the good on the y-axis, OK?

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.730
Essentially, the marginal
rate of substitution

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.690
tells you how your
relative marginal utilities

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:22.150
evolve as you move down
the indifference curve.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:28.150
When you start at point
A, you have lots of pizza

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.890
and not a lot of cookies.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:37.040
When you have lots of pizza,
your marginal utility is small.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.488
Here's the key insight.

00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:41.030
This is the thing which, once
again, it's a light bulb thing.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.240
If you get this, it'll make
your life so much easier.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.860
Marginal utilities are
negative functions of quantity.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.380
The more you have
of a thing, the less

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.170
you want the next unit of it.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.540
That's why, for example,
cookies is now in the numerator

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.110
and pizza is in the denominator,
flipping from this side, OK?

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.200
The more you have a good,
the less you want it.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.680
So start at point A.
You have lots of pizza

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.290
and not a lot of cookies.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.070
You don't really
want more pizza.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.750
You want more cookies.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.570
That means the
denominator is small.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.900
The marginal utility
of pizza is small.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.340
You don't really want it.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.600
But the marginal utility
of cookies is high.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.590
You want many of them.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.490
So this is a big number.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.650
Now let's move to point B.
Think about your next decision.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.618
Well, now, your marginal
utility of pizza,

00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:34.910
if you were going to go from
two to one slice of pizza,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.100
now pizza is worth a
lot more than cookies.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.080
So now it gets smaller.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.147
So essentially, as you move
along that indifference curve,

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.230
because of this, you want--
because of diminishing

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.720
marginal utility,
it leads this issue

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.630
of a diminishing marginal
rate substitution, OK?

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.060
So basically, as you move
along the indifference curve,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.050
you're more and more willing to
give up the good on the x-axis

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.457
to get the good on the y-axis.

00:29:58.457 --> 00:30:00.290
As you move from the
upper left to the lower

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.660
right on that indifference
map, figure 2-6,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.260
you're more you're
more willing to give up

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.220
the good on the x-axis to
get the good on the y-axis.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.040
And what this implies is that
indifference curves are--

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.230
indifference curves are
convex to the origin.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.060
Indifference curves are
convex to the origin.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.430
That's very important.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.873
OK, let's see, they
are not concave.

00:30:28.873 --> 00:30:30.290
They're either
convex or straight.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:34.723
Let's say they're not concave
to the origin, to be technical.

00:30:34.723 --> 00:30:36.140
Indifference curves
can be linear.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.563
We'll come to that.

00:30:37.563 --> 00:30:39.230
But they can't be
concave to the origin.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.872
Why?

00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:42.080
Well, let's look at the next
figure, the last figure,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.145
figure 2-7.

00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:45.020
What would happen if
indifference curves were

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.820
concave to the origin?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.820
Then that would say,
moving from one pizza--

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.352
so now I've drawn a
concave indifference curve.

00:30:55.352 --> 00:30:57.560
And with this indifference
curve, moving from point A

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.290
to point B leaves
you indifferent.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.320
So you're happy to give
up one slice of pizza

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.820
to get one cookie.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.780
Starting with four slices
of pizza and one cookie,

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.280
you were happy to give
up one slice of pizza

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.580
to get one cookie.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.248
Now, starting from
two and three,

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.290
you're now willing to give
up two slices of pizza

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.250
to get one cookie.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.390
What does that violate?

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.070
Why does that not make sense?

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.123
Yeah.

00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:25.040
AUDIENCE: Law of diminishing
marginal returns?

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.498
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, law of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:31:27.498 --> 00:31:30.860
Here, you were happy to
have one slice of pizza

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.790
to get one cookie.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.060
Now you are willing to
have two slices of pizza

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:33.980
to get one cookie,
even though you have

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.690
less pizza and more cookies.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.010
That can't be right.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.800
As you have less pizza and
more cookies, cookies--

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.620
pizza should become more
valuable, not less valuable,

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.530
and cookies should become less
valuable, not more valuable.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.660
So a concave to the
origin indifference

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.445
curve would violate
the principle

00:31:49.445 --> 00:31:51.987
of diminishing marginal utility
and diminishing marginal rate

00:31:51.987 --> 00:31:53.600
of substitution, OK?

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.100
Yeah.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.524
AUDIENCE: What if it's like
something like trading cards?

00:31:56.524 --> 00:31:57.357
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK.

00:31:57.357 --> 00:32:01.260
AUDIENCE: I mean, I mean, as
you get more trading cards,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.482
you have-- you're already
made a complete set.

00:32:04.482 --> 00:32:06.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
very interesting.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.400
So in some sense,
what that is saying

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.710
is that your utility
function is really over sets.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.570
You're saying your
utility functions

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.950
isn't over trading cards.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.370
It's over sets.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.840
So basically, that's
what's sort of a bit--

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.837
you know, our
models are flexible.

00:32:21.837 --> 00:32:23.170
One way is to say they're loose.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.840
Another way is to
say they're flexible.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.835
But one of the challenges
you'll face on this course

00:32:28.835 --> 00:32:31.210
is thinking about what is the
decision set over which I'm

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.470
writing my utility function?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.510
You're saying it's
sets, not trading cards.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.233
So that's why it happens.

00:32:37.233 --> 00:32:37.900
Other questions?

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.350
Good question.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.120
Yeah, at the back.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.412
AUDIENCE: What about like
addictive things, where like,

00:32:41.412 --> 00:32:43.433
the more you have it,
the more you want to buy?

00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:45.850
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, that's
a really relishing question.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.160
I spent a lot of my
research life, actually--

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.290
I did a lot of research
for a number of years

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.970
on thinking about
how you properly

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.910
model addictive
decisions like smoking.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.700
Addictive decisions
like smoking,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.730
essentially, it really
is that your utility

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.030
function itself shifts as
you get more addictive.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.315
It's not that your
marginal utility--

00:33:06.315 --> 00:33:07.690
the next cigarette
is still worth

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.310
less than the first cigarette.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.977
It's just that as you
get more addicted,

00:33:10.977 --> 00:33:13.450
that first cigarette gets
worth more and more to you.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.667
So when you wake up in the
morning feeling crappy,

00:33:15.667 --> 00:33:17.500
that first cigarette
still does more for you

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.910
than the second cigarette.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:22.163
It's just, the next day you
wake up feeling crappier, OK?

00:33:22.163 --> 00:33:23.580
So we model addiction
as something

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.090
where essentially,
each day, cigarettes

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.140
do less and less for you.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.390
You get essentially adjusted
to new-- you habituate

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.042
to higher levels.

00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:34.500
And this is why I do a lot of
work-- you know, this is why,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.747
unfortunately, we saw
last year, the number--

00:33:36.747 --> 00:33:38.580
the highest number of
deaths from accidental

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.540
overdose in US history.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.870
72,000 people died from drug
overdoses last year, more than

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.770
ever died in traffic accidents
in our nation's history, OK?

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.880
Why?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.940
Because people get
habituated to certain levels,

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.690
and they get habituated
to certain levels.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.965
So people get
hooked on Oxycontin.

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:55.590
They get habituated
to a certain level.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.140
They maybe switch
to heroin, and they

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.260
habituate to a certain level.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.060
And now there's this
thing called fentanyl,

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.800
which is a synthetic opioid
brought over from China,

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.470
which is incredibly powerful.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.920
And dealers are mixing the
fentanyl in with the heroin.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.889
And the people shoot
up, not realizing--

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.280
at their habituated
level-- not realizing

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.738
they have this
dangerous substance,

00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:14.260
and they overdose and die.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.120
And that's because they've
got habituated to high levels.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.750
They don't realize they're
getting a different product.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.875
So it's not about not
diminishing marginal utility.

00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:22.550
It's about different--
underlying different products.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.690
All right?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.703
Other questions?

00:34:25.703 --> 00:34:27.370
Sorry for that
depressing note, but it's

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.239
important to be
thinking about that.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.010
That's why, once again,
we're the dismal science.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.510
We have to think
about these things.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.020
OK, now, let's come
to a great example

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.489
that I hope you've
wondered about,

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.650
and maybe you've already
figured out in your life,

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.067
but I hope you've
at least stopped

00:34:40.067 --> 00:34:43.780
and wondered about,
which is the prices

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.639
of different sizes of goods,
in a convenience store, say.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.610
OK, take Starbucks.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.510
You can get a tall
iced coffee for 2.25,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.990
or the next size, whatever the
hell they call it, bigger, OK?

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.750
You can get, for 70 more cents--

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.050
so 2.25, and you can double
it for 70 more cents.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.640
Or take McDonald's.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.500
A small drink is $1.22 at the
local McDonald's, but for 50

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.760
more cents, you can
double the size, OK?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.930
What's going on here?

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.390
Why did they give you
twice as much liquid,

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.780
or if you go for ice
cream, it's the same thing.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.900
Why do they give you twice as
much for much less than twice

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.243
as much money?

00:35:26.243 --> 00:35:26.910
What's going on?

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.230
Yeah.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.110
AUDIENCE: Since your marginal
utility is diminishing

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.290
as you have more coffee
available to you,

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.060
you're willing to
pay less for it,

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.278
so they make the
additional coffee cheaper.

00:35:39.278 --> 00:35:40.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.820
That's a great
way to explain it.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.120
The point is it's all about
diminishing marginal utility.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.970
OK, when you come in to
McDonald's on a hot day,

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.738
you are desperate for
that soda, but you're not

00:35:50.738 --> 00:35:52.280
as desperate have
twice as much soda.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.090
You'd like it.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.830
You probably want
to pay more for it,

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.540
but you don't like it nearly as
much as that first bit of soda.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.980
So those prices simply
reflects the market's reaction

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.407
to understanding diminishing
marginal utility.

00:36:04.407 --> 00:36:06.240
Now, we haven't even
talked about the supply

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.198
side of the market yet.

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.198
I'm not getting to how
providers make decisions.

00:36:09.198 --> 00:36:10.470
That's a much deeper issue.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.170
I'm just saying that this is
diminishing marginal utility

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.090
in action, how it
works in the market,

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.300
and that's why you see this, OK?

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.430
So basically, what you see is
that that first bite of ice

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.090
cream, for example,
is worth more,

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.090
and that's why the ice
cream that's twice as big

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.540
doesn't cost twice as much.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.330
Now, so basically,
what this means

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:37.620
is, if you think about our
demand and supply model,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:43.800
on a hot day, or any day, the
demand for the first 16 ounces

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.640
is higher than the demand
for the second 16 ounces.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.520
But the cost of producing
16 ounces is the same.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.720
So let's think about this.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.137
It's always risky when I try
to draw a graph on the board,

00:36:55.137 --> 00:36:56.500
but let's bear with me.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.860
OK, so let's say we've got a
simple supply and demand model.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.610
You have this supply
function for soda,

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.560
and let's assume
it's roughly flat.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.530
OK, let's assume sort of
the cost the firm proceeds

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.820
within some range.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.880
The firm-- basically,
every incremental 16 ounces

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.260
costs them the same.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.720
So that's sort of
their supply curve.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.630
And then you have
some demand curve, OK?

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.900
You have some demand curve
which is downward sloping, OK,

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.130
and they set some price.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.490
And this is the
demand for 16 ounces.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:33.000
Now, what's the demand for
the next 16 ounces, OK?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.450
Yeah, this isn't going to work.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.710
We have to have an
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.630
Sorry about that.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.630
We have a slightly upward
sloping supply curve, OK?

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.590
Now we have the
demand for the next--

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.450
so here's your price.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.460
Here's your $1.22, OK?

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.205
Now, you say, "Well, what's my
demand when I sell 32 ounces?"

00:37:52.205 --> 00:37:53.580
Well, it turns
out demand doesn't

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.690
shift out twice as much.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.350
It just shifts out
a little bit more.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.443
So you can only charge $1.72
for the next 16 ounces.

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:01.110
Probably, if you want
to go to the big--

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.230
if you go to 7-Eleven, where you
can get sizes up to, you know,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.450
as big as your house, OK--

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.940
they keep these curves keep
getting closer and closer

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.870
to each other.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.270
So those price increments
get smaller and smaller.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.312
And that's why you can
get the monster, you know,

00:38:14.312 --> 00:38:16.200
ginormous Gulp at 7-Eleven--

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.800
is really just not that
different from the price

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.470
of getting the small
little mini size, OK,

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.010
because of diminishing
marginal utility.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.200
All right, and so
that's how the market--

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.820
that's essentially how we can
take this abstract concept,

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.950
this sort of crazy
math, and turn it

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.980
into literally what you see in
the store you walk into, OK?

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.720
Questions about that?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.160
Yeah.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.810
AUDIENCE: So how does this
[? place ?] [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.985
like if for example, you wanted
to buy a snack that you were

00:38:48.985 --> 00:38:50.610
going to have for
breakfast every day--

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.390
JONATHAN GRUBER: Awesome.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.098
Awesome question.

00:38:52.098 --> 00:38:53.598
AUDIENCE: And then
every single day,

00:38:53.598 --> 00:38:55.740
it was going to be your
first granola bar, right?

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:01.720
So I think that it's going to
diminish every single time,

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.325
but it's still
cheaper to buy in bulk

00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:05.950
than it would be to buy a single
granola bar every single time.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.050
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Great, great question.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.685
Yeah?

00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:10.060
AUDIENCE: I think that has
more to do with packaging cost

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.800
than marginal utility.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.780
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, I mean, the risk

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.168
of my going to this model
is, once we get nonlinear,

00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:17.710
the order we do
things in this class,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.700
we have to start
talking about supply

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.990
factors I want to talk to.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.290
But there's two answers.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.080
One is packaging efficiencies.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.250
But the other is, if you
actually go to Costco

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.230
and look at their
prices, for many things,

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.630
they're not actually better
than the supermarket.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.400
So actually, the price
of buying the giant like,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.540
8,000 bars of granola is
actually not that much more--

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:45.040
not that much less than 1,000
time buying eight granola bars.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.340
It's less, but it's not nearly
as much less of these examples

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.520
as sodas in McDonald's,
which is exactly your point.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.820
Utility diminishes
less, so they don't

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.000
want to charge as much
less for multiple packages.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.890
So you can actually--
if you compare

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.530
the gap in perishable
product pricing by size,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.590
it's much larger than the gap in
nonperishable pricing by size.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.370
Great point.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.006
Yeah.

00:40:07.006 --> 00:40:09.150
AUDIENCE: Is there also
just like a different time

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.720
frame to which
the utility starts

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.604
diminishing for every product?

00:40:12.604 --> 00:40:15.340
Because you gave the example
of soda, but it's like,

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.620
would that reset later in
the day, if we wanted--

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.663
were thirsty again, or--

00:40:18.663 --> 00:40:20.080
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Awesome, and that

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.413
is why they don't let you
walk back in with the same cup

00:40:22.413 --> 00:40:23.875
and refill it, right?

00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:26.000
That's exactly right, and
that comes to this point.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.970
It's sort of like
it's nonperishable

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.612
as you get longer apart.

00:40:31.612 --> 00:40:33.570
But you know, it's all
just really interesting.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.520
So at Fenway, OK, you can get--

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.170
you get like a regular
sized soda, it's like crazy.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.960
It's like $6.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.600
Then for like $8,
you get a big soda.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.388
Then for $10, you get a
refillable big soda, OK?

00:40:47.388 --> 00:40:49.930
Now, the question is, can you
bring that refillable soda back

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.700
to additional games?

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.586
Technically not, but I do.

00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:55.440
[LAUGHING]

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.570
And basically they
sort of understand--

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.070
so this interesting
question of sort

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.780
of the perishability of
things and how that's going

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.630
to affect things going on.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.460
It's a really-- it's an
interesting question.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.793
Other comments?

00:41:08.793 --> 00:41:09.960
OK, I'm going to stop there.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.020
Those are great comments.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.510
Thanks everyone
for participating.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.910
And we will come back next time
and talk about the sad reality

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.535
that we haven't won
the lottery, and we

00:41:16.535 --> 00:41:18.650
have limited amounts of money.

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:11.740
MATTHEW VANDER HEIDEN: OK.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.210
So welcome back,
everybody, to 705.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.490
I know this has been a really
challenging semester for all

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.990
of us.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.680
I want to particularly
acknowledge for the seniors

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.700
out there the tragedy of missing
the end of your senior year.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.119
Hopefully us, MIT can
somehow make it up to you.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.510
I can say for my part,
we will do our best

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.810
to teach you
biochemistry remotely.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.750
And just as a couple
logistics, a reminder,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm Matt Vander Heiden.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.250
I'm going to be covering
the remaining part of 705.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.050
For the rest of the
semester, we get

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.590
to focus on biochemistry
of metabolism.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130
We're going to learn
what metabolism

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.590
is, why it's important.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570
And basically, this can be
quite a polarizing topic.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.300
In my experience, people
tend to really love

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.190
or really hate metabolism.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.890
It's interesting, because there
are some people out there who

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.190
pretend to hate it, but actually
deep down really love it.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.080
Hopefully I will inspire you
over the rest of the semester

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.070
to at least have some
appreciation for why metabolism

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.270
is important.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.030
And regardless, for those of you
who want to go to med school,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.880
this is a favorite
topic of MCAT Exams.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.280
And also you will see
that it will come up

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.005
in many different areas
of biology, regardless

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:39.630
of whether you go to
med school or not.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480
So if you do anything
further in biology,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.140
hopefully you'll find this
material somewhat useful.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.660
OK, so getting into
what metabolism is.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.140
So I think it's good to
start with a textbook

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.090
definition of metabolism.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.850
And so metabolism is
the chemical reactions

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:15.400
that all cells and organisms
use to do two things.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:26.950
One, extract energy
from the environment.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:49.500
And two, synthesize
the macromolecules

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.140
that make up all life.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.930
So really, what
metabolism is then

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.420
is the chemistry that
makes life possible.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.410
And so understanding
metabolism is really

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.180
something that will help you
better understand your food.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.300
There's lots of
material out there

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.300
in the popular press about
what's healthy and what's not.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.120
At least this will allow you to
form some of your own opinions

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.850
about those claims, and
how they relate to what

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.190
really goes on in
our cells and bodies.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.830
There's lots of
implications for medicine,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.060
very relevant to agriculture,
the energy sector,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.840
biofuels come from.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.650
And so metabolism
really matters to tackle

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.340
many of the challenges
that face us in society.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
Now as a topic, this
can be very daunting.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.700
As shown here on this
image, we have hundreds,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.940
this is a typical
metabolic pathway chart

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.640
that is hanging in the
walls of my office,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.670
many other laboratories
and academic places

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.910
around the world.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.300
If you look at this chart,
it's filled with hundreds

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.790
of enzymes, complex pathways.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.700
Our goal here is not
to memorize this chart.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.210
You can always look up details
of any pathway or reaction

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.410
that you want.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.550
The goal here really is to
see beyond this complexity.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.029
I want you to appreciate
why metabolism

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.779
works the way it does, why this
chart is organized as it is.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.480
Because what we will find
is that this chart is really

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.690
variations on relatively
few reactions.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.910
It basically is life
repurposing similar chemistry

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.710
to do many different things.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.930
I think there is a
beauty in how life

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.850
can use these
reactions to get such

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.460
a diversity of
macromolecules, and enable

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.650
cells to solve all kinds
of different problems.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.260
You will see that
all of the pathways

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.190
really follow common principles.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.510
These are shared across all
species and all forms of life.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.120
And so at the chemical level,
all life is really related.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.990
And this is why it's so
relevant to understanding

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.080
many of the challenges in
medicine, understanding

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.090
ecology, evolution.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.820
And for you MIT
students, you'll see

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.720
it's also very critical for
using engineering approaches

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.530
based on biology to solve
various problems in the world.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.490
OK.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.940
So now let's start getting
into this a bit more.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.460
Now, the first topic that
we're going to cover over

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.220
the next several
lectures really relates

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.160
to coming back to sugars
and carbohydrates, which

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.912
I talked about and introduced
in my previous lecture.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.620
And we're going to do
this because sugars

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.650
and carbohydrates are key
energy transduction molecules

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.490
and cells.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.610
And it really facilitates a
discussion of the principles

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.650
for how metabolism works.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.140
Now our goal here isn't
to memorize pathways.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.110
We could read about the
glycolytic pathway in an hour.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.570
I could draw it up here in
a very short period of time.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.153
Many of you have
probably already done

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.300
this in high school.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.820
Our goal is instead to
understand this pathway

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.270
at a deeper level, really see
why the breakdown of sugars

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.350
works the way it does, how cells
use this to release energy,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.920
and how that can be used to
support other cell functions.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.810
And so before we
get to that, I want

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.950
to start by introducing just
a couple high-level concepts

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.960
about metabolism.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.190
And so really, based on
our definition before,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.690
metabolism is really
about two things.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:28.470
It's about making stuff, and
we have a fancy term for that.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.520
That is called anabolism.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.980
And it's about
breaking stuff down.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.890
And the term for that
is called catabolism.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.030
And anabolism, building
stuff-- that is,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.110
producing biomass, growing
all of the material

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.970
that's out there, anabolic
steroids help you grow.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.170
This is anabolism
to build stuff.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.870
That is one side of metabolism.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.600
The other side is breaking
stuff down, catabolism.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.850
That is, breaking down
our food, eating food.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.000
Digesting our food is
a way to get energy.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.630
Now of course, to reproduce,
life has to build more cells.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.980
You need more stuff.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.840
You can't create
something from nothing,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.150
and so that requires
energy input.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.800
Anabolism typically
requires energy input.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.530
Whereas that energy has
to come from somewhere.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.370
And that's where
catabolism comes from.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.750
We have to break down food.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.830
And ultimately,
catabolism is the source

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.470
for biological energy for
many different systems.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.870
Now, some of this is
actually somewhat intuitive.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.150
We all learned as
little kids that we

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.000
need to eat food if we're
going to grow up and be

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.320
big and strong.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.390
You also know that if
you're going to run a race,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.100
you've got to eat
a bunch of food,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.400
you need that energy
to fuel your activity.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.710
But maybe what's less
intuitive to many of you

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.320
is we also need energy
to sustain life,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.470
even if we're doing
absolutely nothing.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.300
OK, adults, sit on
the couch all day,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.190
hopefully they're not growing.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.580
But they'll still starve if they
don't constantly eat some food,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.590
even if they're inactive.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.000
And so why is that the case?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.470
Well, hopefully some of
you recall the second law

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.360
of thermodynamics.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.170
So what is the second
law of thermodynamics?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:40.360
It's, in effect, the entropy
of the universe is increasing.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:48.750
That the universe continually
tends towards disorder.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.570
Life is exactly the
opposite of this.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.960
Life is actually
maintaining extreme order

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.180
in the face of the second law.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.570
And so all life must
constantly battle entropy.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.910
And many have described life
at the very highest level

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.080
as being really the
ability to maintain order,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.160
to fight entropy, which of
course requires constant energy

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.880
input.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.740
And metabolism is the process
that all cells use to do this.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.600
Now for humans, I
think we all know

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.960
we need to eat and breathe
in order to stay alive.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.930
For you future MDs
out there, what

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.080
happens if your heart stops,
or you stop breathing?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.590
Well, of course, you die in
a matter of several minutes.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.800
Why is that?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.880
Well, that's because
every cell in your body

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.570
has to do constant catabolism
in order to derive energy,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.550
in order to remain viable.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.390
This means they need constant
food, and particularly

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.200
oxygen delivery.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.780
And if you don't
get those things,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.740
metabolism can no longer
work, and the cells die.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.170
And so energy is sort
of this mystical concept

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.010
that we like to talk about.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.760
And so before we delve
a little bit deeper

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.460
into what I mean by
biological energy, what it is,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.080
why we have to constantly do
catabolism to maintain it,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.870
I want to go back and say
just a little bit more

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.560
about carbohydrates and finish
our discussion there, and talk

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.880
about carbohydrates and sugar
polymers, polysaccharides,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.630
because this has some
additional properties

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.990
I didn't have time to cover
in my prior lecture that

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.090
is important to
understand how it

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.020
allows these molecules to store
energy in a very efficient way.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.840
And it will also enable us to
talk a little bit about how

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.530
carbohydrates can also be
used as structural molecules

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.890
for lots of different organisms.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.270
All right, so a little diversion
to discuss carbohydrates

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.770
and polysaccharides.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.260
And so if you recall
from my prior lecture,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.080
sugars that are greater
than four to five carbons

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.210
can exist either in open
chain or ring forms, furanose

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.990
or pyranose rings.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.700
I'll just remind you by
redrawing up here, glucose.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:33.310
So this is D glucose, drawn
in the open chain form.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.845
Remember this can form a ring.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.600
OK.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:58.760
So it's a reminder,
carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.940
If we have this hydroxyl
group from carbon 5,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.260
form a hemiacetal bond with
the aldehyde at carbon 1,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.660
you get this ring structure.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.440
This would be alpha
or beta, depending

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.040
on whether the hydroxyl
group here at carbon 1

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.380
is pointing up or pointing down.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.460
D-glucopyranose.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.070
So this is review of what we
already talked about last time.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.230
Now, what I want
to talk about is

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.130
that if we form a disaccharide
or a polysaccharide-- that is,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.860
begin to make sugar
bonds, and if we

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.420
do that in a way that ties up
this hemiacetal or hemiketal

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.090
bond, this then
prevents the ring

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.990
from opening and gaining
access to that carbonyl,

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.650
that aldehyde carbonyl, as this
moves between the open chain

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.020
and the ring form.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.310
And so a good example of this
is the disaccharide sucrose.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:07.330
So sucrose is a disaccharide
of glucose plus galactose.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.340
And here is what this
disaccharide looks like.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:53.970
OK, so you have here, glucose
in the alpha-D-pyranose form.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.120
Here's fructose in the
beta, because the OH group

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.410
is pointing out.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.750
Fructofuranose form.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.870
And so the formal name for
this molecule, sucrose,

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:16.270
would be
alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 1-2,

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:22.920
because we're going from carbon
1 of glucose to carbon 2,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.740
there's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 of fructose.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.480
Beta-D-fructofuranose.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.330
Sucrose or
alpha-D-glucopyranosyl

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.340
1-2 beta-D-fructofuranose.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.190
OK, so this disaccharide
forms a bond

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.840
between carbon 1 and carbon 2.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.320
That would be the
aldehyde in glucose,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.530
or the ketone tied
up in the hemiacetal

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.150
or the hemiketal bond
of these two molecules.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.060
And so there's no way that
either of these sugars

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.990
can access the open chain
form, without breaking

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.970
this O-glycosidic bond.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.760
And that's one reason why
sucrose is a very good storage

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.090
molecule for carbohydrates,
because without breaking

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.780
that bond, you prevent access
to gaining these reactive

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.420
aldehyde or ketone
bonds, that could

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.710
react with some other
molecule in the cell.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.560
Now, I mention this
because whether or not

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.250
a particular sugar is
enabled to get access

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.540
to this reactive aldehyde
or ketone really forms

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.430
the basis for a classic
sugar detection lab test.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.870
And this is relevant to discuss
this lab test because it

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.820
explains some nomenclature
that is still used,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.150
and in fact, we
will continue to use

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.020
a bit as we discuss some
aspects of sugar metabolism.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.720
So what this test
is, is basically,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:09.990
is that if you heat the sugar
with copper, which is blue,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.520
and that copper can gain access
to a free carbonyl--that is,

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.450
if the sugar can access the
open chain form to expose

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:24.780
the aldehyde or a ketone, that
copper can then become reduced

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.950
to copper plus.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.470
That changes the color
from blue to red.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.950
And so if you reduce the copper,
you oxidize the bond there.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:40.710
And this test turns positive
if there is a reducing sugar,

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.660
is what it's called.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.140
So a sugar that reduces the
copper from the blue 2 plus

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.780
state to the red plus
state is a positive test.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.440
And so basically,
a reducing sugar

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:16.424
is any sugar with an ability
to access an open chain form.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.900
Because that will
provide the free aldehyde

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.570
or ketone to reduce the
copper in this test.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.070
So this term, reducing
sugar, obviously applies

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.860
to all monosaccharides, because
every single one of them

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.690
has an aldehyde or a ketone, and
can access the open chain form.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.650
But it will only apply
to some disaccharides

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.570
or polysaccharides.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.940
So let's come back
to sucrose up there.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.130
So is sucrose a reducing sugar?

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.710
No, it's not, because
there is no way

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.890
that you can access a
free aldehyde or a ketone

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.970
in sucrose, because it's
tied up in that O-glycosidic

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:06.010
bond between carbon 1 of glucose
and carbon 2 of fructose.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.840
And so you need
to break that bond

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.060
to give them monosaccharide
subunits in order

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.030
to access the open chain form.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.200
However, let's give an
example of a disaccharide

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.790
that is a reducing sugar.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.610
And that's the
disaccharide maltose.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:26.230
So maltose is basically
two glucose molecules.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.750
And those two glucose
molecules are like this.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.560
So this has a O-glycosidic
bond between carbon 1

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.850
of this glucose, and
carbon 4 of that glucose.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:22.740
And so formally, this would
be alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 1-4

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.130
alpha or beta.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.480
If it's pointing down, it's
alpha, pointing up, it's beta.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.650
D-glucopyranose.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.240
So maltose or
alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 1-4

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.100
alpha or beta D-glucopyranose
is a reducing sugar,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.940
because this sugar could
access the open chain form.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.380
You could open up this carbonyl
and expose the free aldehyde

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.360
at position 1.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.060
Now, we could also
refer to this sugar

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.860
as having two different ends.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:13.070
We can refer to this end as
being the non-reducing end,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:19.850
and this end as being
the reducing end.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.890
Because of course, this
bond, this aldehyde

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.660
on the first glucose is tied
up in this O-glycosidic bond,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.290
whereas the one on
this one is not.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:36.080
So this end is non-reducing,
and this end is reducing.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.480
Now this becomes
much more relevant

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.700
if we start talking
about polymers.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.420
And so what starch is.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.950
So starch, what potatoes
are made out of,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.535
is basically a
polymer of maltose.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.720
Polymer of maltose molecules.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.105
So basically our glucose
with 1-4 linkages.

00:21:41.408 --> 00:21:46.350
OK, so I could draw that
end, the reducing end

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:54.330
of the polymer, in
the alpha or beta.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.260
But this here, being
the non-reducing end.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:07.720
Every other subunit is tied up
in this 1-4 O-glycosidic bond.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.000
And so starch is
really a polymer

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.220
of glucose molecules
with bonds between the 1

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.830
and the 4 position
of each subunit.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.270
Now we will see
later that we build

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.810
and break down starch
polymers from only one end,

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.520
from the non-reducing end.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.850
And so having these terms,
reducing and non-reducing,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:37.700
provides the term to specify
different ends of a polymer.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.220
Reducing and non-reducing
ends turns out

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.540
to also be important for naming
conventions for disaccharides

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.250
or polysaccharides.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.100
And this becomes
relevant if we consider

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.530
the disaccharide lactose.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:23:01.850
So lactose is also a polymer
of glucose plus galactose,

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.710
except this polymer of glucose
plus galactose, unlike sucrose,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.420
is different because it
has a different linkage

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:28.140
between the sucrose is a
disaccharide of glucose

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.000
plus fructose.

00:23:35.444 --> 00:23:38.430
Fructose, I wrote
the name correctly.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.530
But lactose is a disaccharide
between glucose and galactose.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.420
And so I'll draw it here.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.900
OK, so this is lactose.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.670
This is galactose here
on the non-reducing end.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.820
So the formal name for
this would be beta,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.470
because there's a
beta linkage here

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:32.330
between carbon 1
of this galactose

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.000
and carbon 4 of this glucose.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:49.550
So be
beta-D-galactopyranosyl 1-4.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:55.050
And this is glucose
in the alpha or beta.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.118
D-glucopyranose.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.620
Lactose, or
beta-D-galactopyranosyl 1-4,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.070
alpha or beta, depending if
I drew down, alpha, up, beta.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.920
D-glucopyranose.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:25.720
Now, this also has
non-reducing and reducing ends.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.140
And by convention, you
would name the sugar

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.930
from the non-reducing
end to the reducing end.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:38.650
Hence I put galactopyranosyl
1-4 alpha-D-glucopyranose,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.050
named them in that order.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:49.240
Now you'll note that lactose,
unlike starch, unlike maltose,

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.890
unlike sucrose, links
these disaccharides

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.510
with a beta linkage between
this sugar and that sugar,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.240
where the other ones
had alpha linkages.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.100
And structurally, this
is very different.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.130
And I just want
to point that out.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:12.940
So this here is basically
alpha-D-glucopyranose.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.600
And so alpha, this is carbon 1.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.520
This is the hydroxyl
pointing down.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.140
That's why it's alpha.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.270
If I make an O-glycosidic
bond to another sugar,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:27.680
you can see that it points and
creates this kinked structure.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.190
Now, if I were to
make this beta,

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.440
this hydroxyl rather
than being here

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.840
would be at this
position on carbon 1.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.340
You can see that
that now creates

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.960
a very different geometry.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.390
Now you have a flat molecule,
as opposed to a kinked molecule.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.410
Now, this has
consequences, of course,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.380
for the enzymes that
break down the sugars.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.950
Obviously, it's going to be
a very different enzyme that

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.680
breaks a bond in
this orientation,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.670
versus a bond in
that orientation.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:07.360
This has, basically implications
for what enzymes we have.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.470
And so lactose, of
course, is milk sugar.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.160
All mammals make
milk, so make lactose,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.980
and break it down
when we're babies.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.490
But most mammals tend
to lose expression

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:27.070
of the enzyme lactase that's
able to break this 1-4 beta

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.920
linkage as we age.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.870
And this is basically
what accounts

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.420
for lactose intolerance.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.220
Now, if you think about it, in
the world, much of the world

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.780
has issues with varying
degrees of lactose intolerance

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.040
in adulthood.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.190
The exception to this is often
people of European ancestry.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.000
Why is this?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.780
Well, Europeans historically
drank milk well into adulthood.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.150
And so this selected
for continuous lactase,

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.730
the enzyme that wouldn't
break that beta 1-4 linkage.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.280
The expression as people
move into adulthood.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.160
And so it's an example of how
cultural things, drinking milk

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.320
into adulthood, really
affected evolution,

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.960
such that that
subpopulation of people,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.430
people with that genetics to
increase lactase expression,

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:26.260
don't become lactose
intolerant as they age.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.100
Now, this alpha
versus beta linkage--

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.640
that is, whether or not you have
this more kinked versus more

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.050
flat structure-- also
has a major effect

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.890
on the structure of
a polymer as well.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.210
And so if we look here
at this starch polymer,

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.260
it's basically this series
of glucose molecules

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.660
stuck together with
alpha 1-4 linkages.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.980
So that's going to create
a kinked structure.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.398
This is best shown
here on this slide.

00:28:59.398 --> 00:29:00.940
So you can see this
kinked structure.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.740
And so when you
build this polymer,

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.390
you're going to end up more with
this helical structure in 3D

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:07.900
space.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.190
That's a very efficient way
to store glucose monomers

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.890
in much less space than
you would otherwise

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.460
get with beta linkages.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.140
Now, it turns out that nature
takes this a step further.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.350
And in addition to just
having this starch polymer,

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.960
it turns out sometimes
you can add branches

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.840
to the starch polymer
to further increase

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.190
the efficiency of
energy storage.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:39.840
So if you have here
a starch polymer,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.495
so let me just draw
here a couple subunits.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.770
So this here is a starch
polymer, glucose polymer

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.600
with alpha 1-4
linkages that I can

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.680
put an additional branch on
this by adding on a linkage

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.865
up here on the top.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.740
With an alpha 1-6 linkage.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.560
So the 1 position of here,
to the 6 position of here,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.020
which has the effect of creating
branches on this long polymer,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:31:02.250
such that you have a
single reducing end,

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:10.910
and lots of non-reducing ends.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.450
Each of these non-reducing
ends has a polymer

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.300
of alpha 1-4 linkages
that would be

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:23.870
stuck to the main chain polymer
via this alpha 1-6 linkage.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.880
And this has a couple
implications for storage.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.610
The first is, by only
having one reducing end,

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.760
it reduces maximally the
exposure to a free aldehyde.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.550
And so that makes it
a good storage sugar.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.500
And also as we will
see, we're going

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.970
to break down these sugar
polymers biologically

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.970
from the non-reducing ends,
and build from those ends.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.390
And so there's lots
of hooks or lots

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.230
of places to either add
or remove sugars from,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.310
which allows you to
access carbohydrates

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.000
quickly as needed.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.960
That's shown nicely
here on this slide,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.130
better than I can draw it.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.280
So up here, you have
your non-reducing end

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.400
across the polymer.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.020
So this here would be starch
with the alpha 1-4 linkages

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.970
on the polymer, or
reducing end on one side,

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.010
non-reducing end on the other.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.990
You can then add
branch points to that

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.440
by making an O-glycosidic
bond between carbon 1

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.260
down to carbon 6,
creating a branch.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.750
And so you can see this
helical branch structure

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.950
will then form.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.070
That is both very efficient
to pack lots of glucose

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:36.420
into one place, and give
lots of non-reducing ends

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.090
with which to build
and remove sugars

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:44.100
from for biology to either
store or quickly access

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.390
sugar molecules as needed.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:52.150
Now, in plants, of
course, potatoes

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.700
use starch in a straight chain.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.720
We know that.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.190
However, plants also use
this branched structure.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.010
This is a molecule
called amylopectin.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.860
Amylopectin is better known in
the food industry as Sure-Jell.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.220
It's the material that
allows you to make jelly.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.530
It's the jelling agent in jelly.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:26.160
And effectively, this
has every 24 to 30 units.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.370
There would be a branch with
one of these alpha 1-6 linkages

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.220
to give you this
multi-branched structure.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.430
Now, animals don't make starch.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.650
Animals don't make amylopectin.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.230
But animals make
another molecule

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:45.930
called glycogen. Glycogen,
also a sugar polymer,

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.980
exactly like amylopectin.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.250
Alpha 1-4 linkages
with the alpha 1-6

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.260
to create branch points.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.810
Just like amylopectin,
except glycogen

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:03.120
has even more branches
with a branch every 8

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.590
to 12 glucose units.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.290
And so, this is a
very complex structure

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.520
for both plants and animals
to quickly store and quickly

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.290
release glucose molecules
when they're needed.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.630
Now, this is in contrast
to a glucose polymer

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.850
that can be done that has a
very different 3D structure.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.230
So what if we take
starch, and rather

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.770
than have these
alpha 1-4 linkages,

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:40.484
but instead replace these
with beta 1-4 linkages?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.810
OK, so now beta linkages.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.120
Looks simple
enough, but changing

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.750
the geometry from the alpha to
the beta bond removes the kink.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.420
Now it's much more
of a flat structure.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.490
Turns out this is,
shown on an image here.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.760
So here's a beta
linkage, and suddenly you

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.680
have this flat structure.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.520
This is the same polymer
as starch chemically,

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.060
but has a different linkage,
the beta 1-4 linkage.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:20.030
And that polymer with the
beta 1-4 linkage is cellulose.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.170
And cellulose is, of course,
what wood is made out of.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.920
And so wood and potatoes,
cellulose and starch,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.990
exactly the same polymer.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:33.860
Same number of calories, if you
could access the glucose units.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.400
But the alpha and beta bonds
make them very different.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.540
Obviously, wood and cellulose is
a very good structural polymer

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.260
for plants.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.180
We build houses out of it.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.890
We don't build houses
out of potatoes,

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.150
but we eat a lot of potatoes.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.440
So equally good molecule
for plants to store lots

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.660
of food for energy.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.600
Turns out wood is a great
source of energy too.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.130
You just need to
have an enzyme that

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.250
can break the beta 1-4 bond.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.190
Termites have symbiotic microbes
that allow them to do this,

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:08.330
and this is why termites can eat
wood, a lot of energy tied up

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.530
in wood.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.070
Now, we lack the time to go
into the details about how

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.460
this relates to other
structural carbohydrates.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.950
But in general,
structural carbohydrate or

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.730
carbohydrate-like molecules
form polymers of sugar

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.210
or related molecules, also
with these beta linkages.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.820
And a good example is
chitin, so the material

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.730
in the insect
shells, is basically

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.800
a sugar-like molecule
that's a polymer

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.630
with a beta linkage in it.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.530
Same thing with cartilage
in humans and animals.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.110
And you can look up
the details of what

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.140
these things look like, of
course, if you're interested.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:51.150
Chitin and cartilage aren't
made of true polysaccharide

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.090
polymers, but they're very
related to polysaccharides.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.580
And they really
illustrate how nature

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.940
can take carbohydrate
chemistry and repurpose

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.910
it to basically act
as an energy source,

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.750
but also build all kinds
of structural molecules

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.440
that are really
useful in biology.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.780
All right, now I
want to go back to,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.720
here's ways that one can
store and use carbohydrates

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.230
in interesting ways.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.580
But now I want to come back
to them as energy sources,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.950
and assuming you can
access the glucose

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:28.300
and whatever polymer
it's present in, how can

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.000
you actually metabolize
it to provide energy

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.910
in a way that sustains life?

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.500
And this means
we're going to turn

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.640
to another topic, a
topic that's typically

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.540
referred to as bioenergetics.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.450
Bioenergetics, which is
really the discussion

00:37:54.450 --> 00:38:00.120
of how energy is transduced
in biological systems.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.960
I'm going to introduce
this topic today,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.282
we're going to revisit
it throughout the course.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:07.240
But it's really important
to ask this question.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.990
We really want to
consider, what do we mean

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.540
when we say biological energy?

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.560
What is biological energy?

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.050
Well, someone probably made
you memorize in high school,

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.440
and often you were
thinking, oh, it's just ATP.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.030
And certainly, ATP,
adenosine triphosphate,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:33.000
is a very important molecule for
biological energy transduction.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.380
But I want to actually explore
why ATP is actually useful.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:45.350
And if ATP is energy, why don't
we just eat all kinds of ATP?

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.320
I can say for a fact that
absolutely none of you

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.020
had ATP today for breakfast.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.830
No one sells ATP as
an energy booster.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.380
And so if ATP is such
a great energy source,

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.420
why don't we just eat it?

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.440
And to really understand
ATP, how it works,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.200
what biological
energy really is,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.080
we really need to revisit
some very basic topics

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.250
in thermodynamics.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.350
Now, thermodynamics strikes
fear into the hearts of students

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.730
everywhere.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.120
You can get details of
thermodynamics and the theory

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.280
around these things
in other courses.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.070
That's not really what
we're going to try

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.380
to accomplish here in 705.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.500
Our goal here is really
a practical understanding

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.730
of how thermodynamics applies
to biology and metabolism.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.500
And we need to go into
this, because it's

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.790
key to understanding
why we store energy,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.770
go through all this
trouble to store energy

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.370
as these carbohydrate
polymers to begin with.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:52.040
Why we eat potatoes and
not ATP, as well as why ATP

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.970
is actually useful to cells.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.610
And so let's take a step
back and just think about it.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.600
Let's think about wood.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.160
I just told you, wood is a
polymer of glucose molecules

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.520
with beta 1-4 linkages.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.950
How can we, forget as
organisms, as cells.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.280
But how can you release
energy from wood,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.870
to do other kinds of work?

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.560
Well, we can burn it.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.190
And so what's the
chemistry of burning wood?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.100
Well, it's a
carbohydrate polymer.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:32.120
So it has this CnH2n formula.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.260
If we combine that
carbohydrate with oxygen,

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:45.340
it releases CO2 and water,
plus some light, plus heat.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:52.280
This light and heat
is energy, because we

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.890
can use it to do work.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.050
Boil water, turn a
turbine, make electricity.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.550
Whatever.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.660
Warm ourselves by the fire.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.900
Use the light to do
some other things.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:13.150
And so this burning of wood is
certainly release of energy.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.930
Now, we lack the enzymes to
do this reaction in wood,

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.410
because we can't break
that beta 1-4 linkage.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.390
But we certainly can break that
alpha 1-4 linkage in starch

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.800
from potatoes.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.860
And we use the
exact same chemistry

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.090
to burn that glucose
and release energy.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.030
Except the difference
is that if I burn wood,

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.580
I do this all in one step.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.100
But life is a much better
engineer than that.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.560
It basically, rather
than releasing

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.500
all of that energy in
one step, it really

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.950
releases it stepwise
in a manner that's

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.620
actually useful to cells.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.720
But it's exactly the
same release of energy.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.880
And so what life
is, or extracting

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.030
biological energy
is, is it's really

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:16.000
the ability to do stepwise
oxidation of glucose

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.870
or other carbon.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.430
I'll write glucose for now.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.710
To get energy.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.610
So we burn wood, that's
favorable, it releases energy.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.120
If we do stepwise
oxidation, we also

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.050
can release energy as well.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.470
Same reaction, also
releases energy.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.430
How much energy do
we get from releasing

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:48.930
us burning glucose, as you
do and burning it in a fire?

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.630
Well, it has to be exactly
the same amount, because it's

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.100
exactly the same reaction.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.790
So we burn wood, we
get light and heat.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.150
Cells burn glucose, it
releases the exact same amount

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.050
of energy.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.110
It just does so in a way
that allows the cells to do

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.520
biologically useful things.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.210
What are those?

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.250
Well, it could be heat.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.780
All of us maintain temperature.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.270
So heat is a
conversion of energy

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.467
that of course, is
useful to biology.

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:16.800
But it can do other things, too.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.150
It can allow cells to move.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.940
It can allow them
to do any reaction

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:25.300
to fight that entropy
that allows life to exist.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:31.150
And so all things,
including ourselves,

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.930
have to follow the same
laws of thermodynamics.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.820
Life is not special
in that regard.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.240
And so burning
wood is favorable,

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.060
because it increases the
entropy of the universe.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.000
You're breaking up this polymer
into a bunch of monomers.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.920
That's going to be spontaneous.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.850
That is in accordance with the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.120
True if cells burn it as well.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.180
But remember, the
second law says

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.557
that net entropy of the
universe must always increase.

00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:05.390
And so if we're going
to do something that's

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.350
not energetically favorable,
like build a glucose polymer,

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.790
we obviously have to
put energy into it.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.520
And to do so, the
energy that's released

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.980
must be greater than the
energy that we actually store.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.850
And so this is actually a really
key point, because anything

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:29.620
that we do that requires
energy input for a cell

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.520
to carry out that process
requires a source of energy

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.690
release somewhere else that is
equivalent or greater than what

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.040
is actually put in.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.730
And so cells need
energy, because they

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.210
do lots of thermodynamically
unfavorable things,

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:50.450
fighting that entropy
of the universe.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.110
And all of those processes must
come from the release of energy

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:59.260
elsewhere, like the
burning of carbohydrate.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.280
And so that constant
energy input

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.920
is at the very
highest level, why

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.660
we need to do constant
metabolism in order to maintain

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.580
order and survive as organisms.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.030
Now this, of course,
comes from things

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.410
like burning of carbohydrate.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.660
But of course, that carbohydrate
has to come from somewhere.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.280
And so ultimately, you have
to have an external source.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.440
That external source
is of course, the sun.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.890
Photosynthetic organisms can
use light energy from the sun

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.080
to do exactly the same things.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.820
Build those excess
polymers, and that's

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.090
why we as animals
or anything that

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.760
eats other animals
as a way to live

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.590
is ultimately
depending on eating

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.270
photosynthetic
organisms, because

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:49.410
photosynthetic organisms
do this by harvesting

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.880
energy of the sun.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.790
Now that's all very high level.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.300
But I want to come back to
the specifics of metabolism,

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.780
ultimately, and understand those
as how they relate to enzymes'

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.210
reactions and pathways.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.600
That is, how do you get that
complex series of reactions

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.840
that make life
possible, and ultimately

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.280
still be guided by these
exact same principles?

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.740
In other words, how do we couple
the energy releasing reactions,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.740
like burning glucose,
in a way that

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.340
obeys the laws of thermodynamics
and operates under biologically

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:31.690
acceptable conditions in
order to do things that

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.470
are biologically unfavorable.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.340
That's really what
bioenergetics is.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.430
And so the next thing we
want to consider then,

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.890
if we want to understand
this, is really,

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:44.060
let's ask the question.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:47:03.440
What determines if a
specific reaction occurs?

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.190
That is, what determines if
something like burning wood

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.760
actually spontaneously happens?

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.930
If you light wood on
fire, it will burn.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.670
It does so every
single time, everyone

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.140
has had that experience.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.440
But no one has ever seen
CO2 and water spontaneously

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.300
come together and form a tree.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.930
That doesn't happen.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.740
So what determines
whether you burn wood

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.950
and that is
favorable, versus why

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:32.300
it is that CO2 and water don't
come together and spontaneously

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.710
form a tree?

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.960
Do not think that this is
determined entirely by enzymes.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.180
Enzymes are catalysts.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:47.050
Enzymes are the spark that makes
the burning of wood possible.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.820
But remember, enzymes cannot
change thermodynamics.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.900
Enzymes only change the rate
at which a reaction happens.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.180
It does not change
the equilibrium.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:03.480
That tree wants to, if given the
catalyst, form CO2 and water.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.850
That reaction is
spontaneous because it

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.580
is thermodynamically favorable.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.280
That tree will not
take CO2 and water

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.470
and spontaneously reform a tree.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.300
And there's no amount
of enzyme that will

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.790
make that happen all by itself.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.070
And so remember that.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:25.650
If you have any reaction
between A and B,

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.920
there is some
equilibrium, as defined

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.500
by the chemical
properties of A and B,

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:36.520
such that the equilibrium lies
far to one side or the other.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.450
And that equilibrium is
determined by thermodynamics.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.930
It is not determined by enzymes.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.110
I don't care how
much enzyme I add.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:50.010
If the equilibrium lies
towards A as I draw it,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:55.650
I can add all the enzyme I want,
and I can never create more B.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.610
And so, this is super
important, and is actually

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.640
a point that is gotten
wrong by lots of biologists.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.580
They think, oh, this
enzyme is expressed.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.710
Therefore, this pathway
must be happening,

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.000
or this reaction must
be happening faster.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.220
You need an enzyme to
catalyze a reaction.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.820
So a reaction may
not occur, your wood

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.580
may not burn unless you
give it a spark, a catalyst

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.470
to actually make it happen.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.030
But you cannot add a catalyst
to fight thermodynamics.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.550
You cannot take that CO2
and water and turn it back

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.600
into a tree.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.740
And the same thing is true.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.380
You can add all the enzyme
in the world you want,

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:38.390
and all it will do is help A
and B establish the equilibrium

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:41.540
that is defined by
the thermodynamics

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.780
of the relationship
between A and B.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.450
Now, what determines
the equilibrium

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.640
between any two species?

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.000
That's a topic for another
class, why a species is favored

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.110
to be one side or another.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:59.090
However, a useful tool to think
about this in biochemistry

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:02.030
and quantify this for
any pair of reactions

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.427
is something you've probably
learned about before.

00:50:04.427 --> 00:50:06.260
It's something called
the Gibbs free energy.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.150
Gibbs free energy, or delta G.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:22.470
Delta G is related
to the way we'll talk

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:29.590
about the equilibrium constant.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.480
And it's basically
a term that we

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:37.520
can use to specify if a
reaction is favorable or not.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.650
And so hopefully you learned
in an introductory class

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:53.760
that if delta G is less than
0, our reaction is spontaneous.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:00.940
If delta G equals 0, our
reaction is that equilibrium.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:17.510
If delta G is greater
than 0, our reaction

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:24.060
is not spontaneous.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:28.250
All right, if we
take our log and ask,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.960
what is delta G to turn that
log into CO2 plus water,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.620
it is less than 0, because
it is very spontaneous.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.420
We take a pile of
ashes and ask what

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.030
delta G is to recreate the log.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.760
It's greater than 0, because
it ain't going to happen.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:50.950
And if it's at some equilibrium,
delta G is equal to 0.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:57.580
Now, delta G depends
entirely on conditions,

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.330
as we will see in a minute.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:06.490
And because of that,
this means that there

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:16.510
can be conditions where
absolutely any reaction can

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:19.570
be favorable if the
conditions are right.

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:23.620
And we'll see that this becomes
very relevant to understand

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.610
how metabolism works.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.990
And so let's go back
and just now consider

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.910
some generic reaction, A and B.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.400
So at equilibrium, what happens?

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:46.820
So at equilibrium,
the concentration of A

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:51.800
and the concentration
of B are not changing.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.530
Delta G equals 0.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.250
These two things
are at equilibrium,

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.600
whatever that equilibrium is.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.660
A and B are not changing
in concentration.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:08.100
Now if I come and I add more A
to this side of the equation,

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:08.970
what does that mean?

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:11.210
Well, you know from Le
Chatelier's principle

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.460
that that's going
to favor production

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.430
of B. We have shifted things
now out of equilibrium.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:29.410
So if I add A, that
leads the production of B

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.410
to re-establish
this equilibrium.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:39.040
That means that delta G
from A to B is less than 0

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.380
until I've reestablished
equilibrium,

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.830
and now delta G is
back to 0 again.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.555
Now, what happens if I add B?

00:53:46.555 --> 00:53:51.010
Well, if I add B, now I'm
going to produce some A. So

00:53:51.010 --> 00:54:02.160
add B. That leads
the production of A,

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.640
until I reestablish
that equilibrium.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.780
So delta G, in that
case, to go from B

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:14.880
back to A. The reverse
reaction is less than 0.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.512
Or I could also say that
delta G, to go to A to B

00:54:18.512 --> 00:54:20.220
here, because that's
not going to happen.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.637
I just added more
B. I'm not going

00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:24.750
to suddenly create
more B from A.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:30.120
So here now, delta
G is greater than 0.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.180
Now note when I did
this, I don't actually

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.860
have to specify how much A
or how much B I've added.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:46.290
The equilibrium depends
on the ratio of B to A.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:50.620
Not the absolute concentration
of either species.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.910
And so having a way to think
about this equilibrium,

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.960
it turns out, is also useful
for biological systems

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:04.110
to divine some delta G
that is helpful to relate

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.110
to this equilibrium constant.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:12.015
And that is this concept
of delta G 0 prime.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:20.560
A standard free energy,
which for biological systems,

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.200
relates to the equilibrium
constant at 25 degrees,

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.750
or the pH of 7 and 1 atmosphere.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.720
Pretty typical
biological conditions.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.700
And this here is
basically related

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.590
to the equilibrium constant.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:35.830
And we can calculate
the actual delta G

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.600
by the following formula.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.970
Delta G equals delta
G 0 prime plus RT

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:49.500
times the log of the
products over the reactant.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:54.720
So this would be drawn
for the reaction A to B.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.020
So the reaction
A to B is related

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:01.450
to delta G 0 prime, which is
related to the equilibrium

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:01.950
constant.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.260
I'll tell you how in the second.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:09.150
Plus R is the gas constant, T
is the temperature in Kelvin

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:12.900
times the natural log of
the ratio of products,

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:20.600
B over reactants, A. This
tells you whether or not

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:24.260
at specific
concentrations of B and A,

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.990
that is a specific
ratio of B and A,

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:30.890
whether it is favorable
to go from A to B, delta G

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:34.550
less than 0, or whether it is
favorable to go from B to A,

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:37.310
delta G greater than 0.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:41.630
And so this should begin to make
it clear that whether or not

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:45.350
a specific reaction
occurs is affected

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:47.600
by the actual
conditions present.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.590
And you can calculate that
based on this relationship.

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:55.850
And so if I specify
concentrations of A and B,

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:58.820
as well as delta
G 0 prime, I can

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.950
know, at those concentrations,
which direction of the reaction

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:05.880
is favored.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.850
Now of course, my drawing A
to B is entirely arbitrary.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.090
I could equally draw
it B to A. And if I

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:21.320
did that, so this is delta
G 0 prime, A to B, all I do

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.460
is flip the signs.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.480
So delta G equals
delta G 0 prime.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:33.440
The negative of A to B is equal
to the positive of delta G 0

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.570
prime from B to A, because
the direction is arbitrary.

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:42.230
Plus RT log in this case.

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:46.940
Now I have A is my product,
and B is my reactant.

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:51.350
If I just flip the
sign, flip that ratio,

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:55.220
it's just going to change
the sign of my product

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.610
and give me exactly the same
result with the opposite sign,

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.530
which makes sense.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:02.480
What's favorable
in one direction

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.620
is not favorable in the other
direction, and vice versa.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.050
Now, I can also set
delta G equals 0.

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:12.800
That's equilibrium.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:20.710
If I do that, then delta G
0 prime equals negative RT.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:26.120
So this would be for A to
B. I'll use the top example.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.630
So delta G equals 0.

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:37.000
Then I have delta G 0 prime
equals RT times log B over A.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.460
So if I know two things
are at equilibrium,

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:44.890
I can calculate delta G 0 prime,
and know what the equilibrium

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.270
constant is.

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:50.470
And so it follows from this
then that if delta G 0 prime

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:59.670
is negative, that means B is
favored over A at equilibrium.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.670
And if delta G 0
prime is positive,

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:12.040
that means A is favored
over B at equilibrium.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:21.770
And so delta G 0 prime
really is a convenient way

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:26.720
to look at a reaction, and know
which direction the equilibrium

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.860
lies.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.680
So A and B, delta G
0 prime is negative,

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.270
equilibrium lies to B. Between
A and B, if delta G 0 prime

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:39.830
is positive, the
equilibrium lies towards A.

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:43.760
But the key concept is that
for any specific reaction,

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.620
any specific conditions of
A and B, whether or not A

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:53.180
is converted to B will be
defined by the equilibrium

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.230
constant.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:58.280
But it will also be
defined about what delta

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.150
is under those conditions.

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:32.250
So to be clear, delta G
will depend on conditions,

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.340
because I'll write
it again, delta G

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:46.040
equals delta G 0 prime plus RT
times the log for the reaction,

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.310
A goes to B. So
products over reactants.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:54.380
And so whether or not
A is converted to B

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.920
will be a property of
the equilibrium constant,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.850
plus the concentration of B
and the concentration of A,

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:06.200
that ratio of concentrations
at the conditions present.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.600
And if in that calculation,
delta G is less than 0,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.410
that reaction is spontaneous.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:20.730
If delta G is greater
than 0, that reaction

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:25.380
is not spontaneous.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.970
Or to put it another way,
if delta G is less than 0

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:36.930
under those conditions,
energy is released.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:41.490
Or if delta G is greater
than 0, that reaction

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:54.440
will not occur
without energy input.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.690
If I burn wood,
energy is released.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.640
But there's no way
I can reassemble

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:10.540
that log without some
kind of energy input.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.750
And really getting
this concept is

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:17.320
central to understanding
metabolism, as well as

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.560
what biological energy means.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.690
And hopefully, what
is now apparent,

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:32.990
based on what I just said, is
that what really determines

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.390
delta G is two things.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.370
Of course it's the
equilibrium constant.

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:42.290
But in essence, delta
G for any reaction

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:49.880
is proportional to the
ratio of the reactants

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.720
over the products.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.800
And that I can come
up, at least in theory,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.250
with any relationship, any
ratio of reactants to products

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.490
to make this favorable.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.910
At some tiny, tiny
concentration,

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:09.640
if I have nothing
but CO2 and water,

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.480
and infinite time and infinite
catalysis, a tiny bit of wood

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.910
could spontaneously form.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:19.060
And so life really
creates the conditions

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:23.230
that allow that, and select for
that to happen, and of course,

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:26.230
add energy input so it
can actually happen more.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.450
And so this should
be very clear to you

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.440
that absolutely no
reaction is irreversible.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.420
I don't care what
your textbook says.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.750
Lots of sources will discuss
irreversible reactions.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:41.750
I'll talk about irreversible
reactions later in the course.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:45.190
But what we mean when we say the
word irreversible reaction is

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.750
these are under
conditions that are

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.420
found in cells and in nature.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.160
And I stress this
because if we want

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.610
to understand the energetics
for how pathways work,

01:03:54.610 --> 01:04:00.670
we have to appreciate that
life can create conditions

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.630
to do unfavorable things,
because that's the only way

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:07.680
that pathways can work.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.750
All right, what what
do I mean by that?

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:16.160
Well, suppose again, we'll
come back to our reaction.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:21.980
A goes to B. Suppose I need
to build a pathway where

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.640
I need to convert A to
B, because B is actually

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.150
useful for some purpose
that I need to do in a cell.

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:33.680
However, what if
this is at least

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.480
by equilibrium, unfavorable?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.240
What if the equilibrium
lies towards A?

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:46.990
That means delta G 0 prime is
positive, is greater than 0,

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:48.580
for A to B.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.630
What does that mean?

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.735
Delta G 0 prime greater than
0, for the reaction A to B?

01:04:52.735 --> 01:04:57.610
That means the equilibrium
lies towards A.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:04:59.620
And so there is no
amount of enzyme

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.280
I can add that will
allow me to net convert A

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.560
to B, because the equilibrium
lies far towards A.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.420
However, whether or not a cell
is able to build a pathway,

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:18.430
where it converts A to
B depends on delta G,

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:22.730
not the equilibrium constant
for that specific reaction.

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.520
So how can I turn A into B?

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.930
Well, I could turn A into B if I
keep the concentration of B low

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.770
enough that delta G, not
delta G 0 prime, that's

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:35.830
the equilibrium
constant, but delta G

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:38.290
favors A to B conversion?

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:42.840
That is, delta G for
A to B is less than 0.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.930
How can I do that?

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:49.980
Well, remember delta G equals
delta G 0 prime plus RT

01:05:49.980 --> 01:06:00.970
log of B over A. So this term
is positive, because I told you,

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.960
the equilibrium
lies towards A. So I

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.920
need a concentration,
a ratio of B to A,

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:15.790
such that B is low enough that
this term is more negative

01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.400
than that term is positive.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.730
And if that's the case,
delta G will be less than 0,

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.590
and I can net move that forward.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.740
So how can I do that?

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.080
How can I keep the
concentration of B low?

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.350
Well, I can build a
pathway that consumes

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:38.080
B in a way to keep it low,
which favors A to B conversion.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.390
In other words, I can build a
pathway, A goes to B goes to C.

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:47.380
So even here, where
delta G 0 prime

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:58.280
is greater than 0, if delta G
0 prime for this reaction, B

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:05.600
to A, is much less than 0,
such that equilibriums strongly

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.720
favor C, that means my
unfavorable equilibrium here

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.610
can be overcome by the very
favorable equilibrium of B

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:23.120
to C. In essence, I can use
B to C to pull A to B, such

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.980
that it actually happens.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:33.320
Produce this intermediate that's
useful on the path to making C.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.600
This strategy is used in
lots of metabolic pathways.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.490
And it's useful to
generate lots of chemically

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.100
useful intermediates.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:55.280
Now note that this only will
work if conversion of A to C

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.330
is favorable.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:08:01.460
That is, if delta G 0
prime is less than 0.

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:06.830
I can only pull this reaction if
delta G 0 prime is less than 0.

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:10.220
That is, if equilibrium
favors A to C,

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:15.350
I can build a pathway this way
to do something unfavorable

01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.050
on the way to making C.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.990
This brings up
another key point,

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:25.080
in that everything
that we discuss,

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.020
relationship between
any two metabolites

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.850
in any single
reaction, also must

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.310
be true for entire pathways.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.859
So I have a three-step
pathway from A

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:42.569
to C. Whether I turn
A into C in one step,

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:46.120
or turn A into C
in multiple steps,

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.330
the free energy is
exactly the same.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:53.890
If I burn wood by
lighting it on fire,

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:56.620
it releases the same
amount of energy

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.020
than if a termite
has an enzyme that

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.080
breaks that beta 1-4
linkage in the wood,

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.550
and can burn that glucose
stepwise through metabolism,

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:09.819
the exact same amount
of energy is released.

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:14.140
Glucose on one side, CO2
and water on the other side,

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.970
exactly the same
amount of energy

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:18.520
released, whether I
do it in one step,

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.529
or I do it in multiple steps.

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:24.250
The equilibrium constant between
those has to be the same,

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:28.420
and the delta G has to be
the same between all of it.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.779
And so it should become
apparent, then, that A to C

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:36.520
has to be favorable if I'm going
to use this trick of keeping

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.260
product low in order to pull an
otherwise unfavorable reaction

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.380
forward.

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.069
In other words,
there's no way for me

01:09:45.069 --> 01:09:49.850
to keep B low and net convert
A to B all on its own.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.520
That will not work.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.390
And it's these unfavorable
reactions that ultimately

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:58.420
then require energy input.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:04.180
And this is where ATP now starts
becoming useful for cells.

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.550
OK, so now I want
to talk a little bit

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:35.380
about how ATP provides
energy that allows otherwise

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:39.250
unfavorable reactions to occur.

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:43.810
And ATP is useful
because delta G

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:48.200
applies to sets of
reactions in the same way it

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.460
applies to single reactions.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.260
That is, it applies
to whole systems.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.900
All reactions are a
series of reactions,

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.950
whether they happen alone
or coupled together.

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:00.760
All have to follow
the same rules.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.700
So now let's make our
reaction more complicated.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:09.720
Let's say A plus B goes to C
plus D, where this is really

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.760
two reactions coupled together.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.920
A being turned into C,
and B being turned into D.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.920
All right, so will
this reaction happen?

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.770
Can I turn A plus
B into C plus D?

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:23.830
Well, how do I know?

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:27.180
Well, it's going to be,
got to calculate delta G.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:35.220
And so it's going to be delta
G 0 prime for A going to C,

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:42.720
plus delta G 0 prime
for B going to D.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.360
So those will relate to
what's the equilibrium

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.630
constant, the equilibrium
relationship between A and C

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:52.290
and B and D. If
it's less than 0,

01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:53.940
equilibrium will
favor to the right.

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.500
If it's greater
than 0, equilibrium

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.320
will favor to the left
of A and C and B and D.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.430
Add them together, that gives
me my overall delta G 0 prime

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.230
for those two reactions.

01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:09.750
Plus RT times the
log of the products.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:22.200
So that's C and D over A and
B. Products over the reactants.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.210
So if I take an unfavorable
reaction-- say, A to C,

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:33.180
if delta G 0 prime is greater
than 0, so it would favor A,

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.180
and I couple it to
another reaction, B

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.760
to D that's very favorable,
because I add these two

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.410
terms together.

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.350
I can now take something
where the equilibrium

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:49.460
would be unfavorable,
and make it favorable.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.840
However, whether or not
this actually happens still

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.720
depends on this ratio of
products to reactants.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.920
So it still depends on
the ratio of C to A,

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.350
and D to B in our
hypothetical thing here.

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:13.850
So to know if a specific
reaction will actually occur,

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:17.690
we have to take into account
both the sum of the delta G

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:20.450
primes related to the
equilibrium constant,

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:25.980
and the actual ratios
that are present in cells.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.220
And so the net
effect is that I can

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.810
couple more favorable
reactions to make otherwise

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:36.110
unfavorable reactions
now become favorable.

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:39.200
That is, have energy input.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.630
But it still depends
on conditions.

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:47.060
And so let's think a little
bit about the polymer synthesis

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.570
that we learned from
Professor Yaffe.

01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:53.520
And so in that process,
what did we do?

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.210
We made several polymers, and
you learned about the chemistry

01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:56.720
to do this.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:02.750
We made DNA, we made
RNA, and we made protein.

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.240
These are polymers
of nucleic acids.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.880
Protein is a polymer
of amino acids.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.980
All of these fight
entropy, right?

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.190
We're building polymers,
not breaking them down.

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:17.790
And all of them were
synthesized using

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:21.750
reactions that hydrolyzed ATP.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.560
In fact, those
reactions actually

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.450
hydrolyzed ATP in
the following way.

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:35.090
And every single one of those
cases, if you look back,

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:37.520
what you will see
is that they all

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.680
had steps where ATP
was taken to AMP

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.060
plus 2 inorganic phosphates.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.750
This reaction is very favorable.

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.940
In fact, it's two reactions.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:15:03.030
It's really ATP goes to
AMP plus pyrophosphate.

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:08.910
And then that pyrophosphate
goes to 2 inorganic phosphates.

01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:20.200
It turns out that delta
G 0 prime is less than 0

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.720
for both of these reactions.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.350
That means the equilibrium lies
towards AMP plus pyrophosphate.

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:32.740
And here, the equilibrium lies
towards 2 inorganic phosphates.

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.870
And so there's actually two
tricks here by metabolism.

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:40.030
One is, it's two very
favorable reactions

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.310
that we're coupled to do
something unfavorable,

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:43.750
build a polymer.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.080
And use the trick of
keeping pyrophosphate low

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.740
by coupling it to a downstream,
very favorable reaction, which

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:58.510
even further pulls
this reaction, and is

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:02.830
why ATP hydrolysis here
becomes so useful as a way

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.460
to build these polymers.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.460
Let's just go quickly
and add a few numbers

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.680
to show exactly what I mean
by how ATP hydrolysis can

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.120
be useful in this setting.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.990
And so, let's do something
a little simpler.

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:26.250
Let's go to ATP plus ADP
plus to inorganic phosphate.

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:29.880
So let's give this some
numbers, delta G 0 prime

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:36.360
in this case is equal to
negative 7.5 kcals per mole.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.600
All right, what does this mean?

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.470
Delta G 0 prime is related
to the equilibrium constant.

01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:47.190
It's less than 0, which
means the equilibrium lies

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:52.140
towards ADP plus phosphate.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.570
Now let's see how
this actually helps

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:58.320
by considering what the
first step in glucose

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.200
metabolism by cells is.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.200
So the first step cells
do in glucose metabolism

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.970
is add an inorganic
phosphate group to glucose.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:14.430
So it's this reaction,
glucose plus inorganic

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:20.700
phosphate goes to
glucose phosphate.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:25.090
Just a quick note on shorthand
that I will use in this course.

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:28.080
So PI, of course, is
inorganic phosphate.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.720
That is this PO43 minus group.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.580
When it forms a
phosphodiester bond,

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.890
like to an alcohol and one
of the glucose molecules,

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.110
I'll draw this in
a future lecture.

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:45.120
I'll oftentimes
indicate it by putting

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.020
a circle around the phosphate.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.350
And so adding this
phosphate to glucose

01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:52.580
is a step that traps
that glucose in cells.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.260
For now, let's just
consider this reaction.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:59.270
And so delta G 0
prime of this reaction

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:05.750
is positive 3.3 kcals per mole.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.710
What does that mean?

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:09.260
Delta G 0 prime relates to
the equilibrium constant.

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:12.080
It says the equilibrium
constant lies here to the left,

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.390
to the glucose plus
phosphate side.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:21.150
So if we want to net trap
glucose phosphate in cells,

01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:23.520
well, it's not going to
happen spontaneously.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.800
You need some kind
of energy input.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.920
That can come from ATP.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.670
And so if we couple those
two reactions as follows.

01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:52.010
So we now have glucose plus
ATP goes to glucose phosphate

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:56.240
plus ADP.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.120
Now let's draw this out.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.420
Will this happen?

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:07.650
So we can calculate delta G.
Delta G equals delta G 0 prime.

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.560
So there's two reactions
happening here,

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.710
glucose to glucose
phosphate, and ATP to ADP.

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:15.880
We know what delta G 0 prime
is by adding those together.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:22.430
So it's 3.3 plus negative 7.5.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:27.380
That equals negative 4.2.

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.560
What does that tell us?

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.950
That says, now we've
created conditions

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:33.770
where the equilibrium constant
lies towards the right,

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.280
towards the glucose
phosphate plus ADP side.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.640
But how much of this
occurs or whether it occurs

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.830
isn't just the property
the equilibrium constant.

01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:44.660
It's also how much is there.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:50.330
And so that's RT times
the log of the products,

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.962
glucose phosphate.

01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:01.035
And ADP over glucose.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.760
And ATP.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:15.310
And so, if this term
is less than 4.2--

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:18.265
that is, if the ratio of glucose
phosphate to glucose and ADP

01:20:18.265 --> 01:20:25.340
to ATP in this term ends up
being less than positive 4.2,

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.050
this reaction is spontaneous.

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:28.850
It is favored.

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:30.410
Lots of conditions
where that would

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:35.820
be the case, although if
this term is 4.2 or greater,

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:38.010
now it will no longer occur.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.770
How much ATP is needed?

01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:46.030
Well, it's hard to answer this
question in absolute terms,

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:48.100
because if there's
a lot of ADP around,

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.690
you need a lot more ATP
for the ADP to be useful.

01:20:52.690 --> 01:20:57.320
And this is the problem with
equating ATP with energy.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.920
The energy here is in the ratio
of ATP to ADP, or ADP to ATP.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.860
And this is something
that we we'll come back to

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.860
in the next lecture,
because in the end,

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:12.790
this is what will determine
if a reaction has happened.

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:16.000
It is not the absolute
concentration of ATP.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.500
It's the fact that ATP
hydrolysis is favorable.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:24.040
But how favorable
that is depends

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.320
on the relevant
concentrations of ATP or ADP.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.520
And relative concentrations
are all that matters

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.720
in thermodynamics.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.600
It is not absolute
concentrations.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.890
It is the ATP-ADP ratio
that is the correct way

01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:43.480
to think about energy.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.680
And this is true for any
reaction with respect

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.240
to energetics.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.330
If an ATP-ADP ratio
exists, such that when

01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:55.510
coupled to a reaction,
delta G is less than 0,

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.250
then it becomes spontaneous.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.730
And this is how ATP
provides energy.

01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:04.580
And we will come back to this
more in the next lecture.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.270
Thank you.

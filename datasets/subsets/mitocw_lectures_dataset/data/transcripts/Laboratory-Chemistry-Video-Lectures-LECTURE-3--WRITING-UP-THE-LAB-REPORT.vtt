WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.970
[RUSTLING]

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.950
[CLICKING]

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.110
SARAH HEWETT: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.760
And if anybody else shows
up, then that'll be fine.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.510
So today, we are going
to talk about how

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.940
to write a lab report, which
is a pretty important part

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.920
of this course, since
it's going to determine

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.750
a good portion of your grade.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.628
And in general,
it's good to know

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:35.420
how to communicate the
science that you do,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.870
whether it's in this
class or in your research,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.270
or in any other context, really.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.000
So I wanted to start just
by thinking about these two

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.335
questions, which is why is
it important to write up

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.710
your results, and then how
should you write a lab report?

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.793
And to help get us thinking
about these questions,

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:51.550
I printed out on
this handout that

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.350
has a good chunk of text on it.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.570
The top part is Ira
Remsen's account

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.910
of his experiment with
copper and nitric acid.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.460
If you have not read it before,
it's a pretty good read.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.610
So if you could skim that.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.413
And then at the bottom, there
is a shorter description

00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:08.080
of the same experiment
in a way that you

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.390
may find it written
either in a lab report

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.410
or in a scientific
paper if you were

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.653
going to publish these results.

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:16.570
So if you guys want to
give those a quick skim

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.040
through, and then
we'll use those

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.620
to sort of talk about
these topics of how do

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.980
you communicate your science.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.560
And if you've never seen
this experiment done before,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.050
I have a little bit
of video to show

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.230
what happens when you put
nitric acid on a penny.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.780
So you can have an
even more vivid visual

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.150
of what Ira Remsen
was going through when

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.610
he decided to pick this up
and throw it out a window.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.230
NARRATOR: A few
drops of nitric acid

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.120
are placed on an
older copper penny.

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:57.730
SARAH HEWETT: And
it goes for a while.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.030
So that should give you a little
bit of an idea of the situation

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.900
that he was in.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.450
And so having had a chance
to skim these two things,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.773
does anyone have any answers
to these questions about

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:24.940
why is it important to write
up your results, or how

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.630
should you communicate your
results to other people?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.445
Yeah.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.200
AUDIENCE: So it's,
like, not ambiguous,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.000
so people know what
to expect or they know

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.552
how to handle the situation.

00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:46.050
[INAUDIBLE] oh, let's see
what happens [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.447
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, using
really clear language,

00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:50.280
so that people know
what is going to happen.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.090
Like he said, the language
acts upon is very vague.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.880
And it led to this
experiment happening

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.730
where Ira Remsen burned his
hands on some nitric acid.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.760
So instead of acts
upon, saying things

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.820
like-- what else
could you say instead?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.457
What are better words you
could use to warn people

00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:09.540
of what's going to happen?

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.480
Yeah.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.830
AUDIENCE: Corrosive.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.100
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, corrosive.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.558
Those things that Scott talked
about in his safety lecture.

00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:22.410
So say some of the
general terms that we

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.550
use to describe chemicals.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.330
It's corrosive, it will
burn, creates toxic gases,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.670
is carcinogenic,
things like that.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.650
What other guidelines
should there

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.190
be for how you want
your results written up?

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:42.679
Yeah.

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:48.230
AUDIENCE: Indicate amounts,
because of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.880
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
yeah, definitely.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.200
You want to communicate
how much you used.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200
So in that first
experiment, he said

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.545
I put some nitric
acid on a penny.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:57.920
So you don't know
what scale that

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.080
was on or what scale it
can be safely done at.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.230
So using exact quantities,
so that if somebody

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.150
is going to redo
the experiment, they

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.340
would know exactly
how much you used

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.520
and what they should expect.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.560
In terms of the length of
these two pieces of writing,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.196
which one is easier to read?

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:17.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:21.250
SARAH HEWETT: The bottom one
so being clear and concise,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.913
using objective,
short sentences,

00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:26.830
so that people can follow
what you're writing.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.247
And they don't have to read
this whole, huge chunk of text

00:04:29.247 --> 00:04:31.280
in order to get the
gist of what's going on.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.655
So those are some things to
keep in mind while writing up

00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:34.590
your lab report.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.950
There's a picture of Ira Remsen.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.170
He was a chemist in the 1800s.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.580
He was born in 1846.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.280
And he became the president
of Johns Hopkins University,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.490
and also is well-known for
discovering the sweetener

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.590
saccharin, which
he also discovered

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.160
by tasting it on his hands as
a result of some more poor lab

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.097
technique.

00:04:53.097 --> 00:04:54.430
I mean, he became pretty famous.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.035
But don't follow his lead
necessarily in that way.

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:01.540
So a good lab report starts
before the lab even begins.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.040
And so here are
some things that you

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.650
should be keeping in mind before
you even come into the lab

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.640
to help set you up to be able to
do the experiment successfully,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.140
and to be able to have the data
that you need to write a lab

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.920
report.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.810
So you want to plan
your procedures ahead

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.240
of time, things that can
influence your results, what

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.100
quantities you need
to measure, and what

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.230
data and results you'll need to
collect, so that you can have

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.772
all of this in your notebook,
so that when you go to write up

00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:26.780
your report you have all of
the information that you need.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.450
It's very hard to
go back into the lab

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.028
and write something down
that you forgot after you're

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:34.570
in your dorm room at 10:00 PM
the night before the lab's due,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.470
going, oh no.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.738
How much did this weigh?

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:39.280
So you want to plan
out ahead of time

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.915
what you're going
to need to collect.

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.790
There are a bunch of
parts to the lab report.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.350
And this looks
slightly overwhelming,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.680
but it's actually there to
help you organize your thoughts

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.080
and present things in a
format that other people can

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.590
recognize.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.960
So if you've ever written a
report for another course,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.720
or if you've read scientific
articles in the literature,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.910
these titles may seem
pretty familiar to you.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.980
You guys have written reports
for other classes before, yes?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.840
Read articles,
most of you, maybe?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.680
OK, so we're going to go through
these parts of the lab report,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.710
and talk about in detail
what belongs in each section.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.720
And we're going to try
to do that in the context

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.345
of the ferrocene
experiment to help you

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:21.430
guys plan out your report for
the one you're going to have

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.625
to write starting next week.

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.000
Hopefully, you've
already started

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.810
the little pieces of it.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.502
So the first thing is the title.

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:30.710
That's usually pretty boring.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.920
Keep it straight to the point.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.810
Have something to do with what
the experiment that you did is.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.310
And then the first
thing that you're

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.268
going to write after the
title is the abstract.

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:43.352
And the abstract that you
guys are probably pretty

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:44.560
familiar with is very short.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.540
It's three to four sentences.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.123
Keep it in complete
sentences, though.

00:06:48.123 --> 00:06:50.165
And then you discuss the
point of the experiment.

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:52.390
You briefly tell what you
did and what you found.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.210
You can talk about
your results--

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.040
if you have any
yields, melting points,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.290
easily digestible results
that you can put at the end.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.930
So for your ferrocene,
you would say,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.510
I synthesized ferrocene
this many grams,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.530
this was its melting point--

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.970
something like that.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.920
And the abstract is best written
at the end of your report.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.610
So after you've done
everything else,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.530
then you can go back
and write the abstract,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.880
because the abstract
is essentially

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.890
just a short summary of
everything else you've written.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.348
So if all the other
stuff is there,

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:21.050
then you can look
at each section,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.170
take a sentence out of
it, smush it all together,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.503
and then you have your abstract.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.420
So then after your abstract,
on the start in the guidelines

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.670
for how to format this and
how to write everything

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.670
are in your lab manuals.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.253
So you should
definitely look at those

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:37.020
while you were preparing
your lab report.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.420
And it'll tell you that,
after the abstract that

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.950
goes on your first
page, the start

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.450
of the second page
of the lab report

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.125
is going to be
your introduction.

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:45.625
And the introduction
should probably

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.948
be about a page or
two long give or take,

00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:49.990
depending on the experiment
and how much you need

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.390
to introduce ahead of time.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.860
And you're going to tell the
reader what you plan to do

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.290
and why they should
care about it.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.260
Give any background
that is necessary-- so

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.570
any historic background,
any scientific background,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.610
experiments that have
come before this one that

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.320
influenced your work.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.030
Include balanced
chemical equations

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.030
of important reactions.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.080
This is very important.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.247
So if you're going to be
doing some sort of chemical

00:08:11.247 --> 00:08:14.530
reaction, which in this
lab we did-- we did two,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.190
then you should include the
balanced chemical equation

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.870
for the work that
you're planning to do.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.720
And then also, any
fundamental mathematical

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.040
equations that you plan to
use to analyze your data.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.040
In this case, we don't
have so many in this lab.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.410
But in future labs,
like the catalase lab

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.990
when you're doing
kinetics, you'll

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.390
have a lot more
mathematical equations

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.292
that you're going to
need to use and explain

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:37.750
to your reader at
the beginning, so

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.862
that they know what's coming.

00:08:39.862 --> 00:08:42.070
And then you want to discuss
any important techniques

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.085
and why you need to
use them in the lab--

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:45.460
their relevance
to the experiment

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.770
that you are planning to do.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.200
So with this in mind,
let's brainstorm

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.340
what might go in the
introduction of your ferrocene

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.840
reports.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.170
So you can think about
the ferrocene lecture

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.790
from Tuesday, stuff you've
done in the lab so far.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.980
Yeah.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.600
AUDIENCE: Like, how
it was discovered,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.285
and how it launched the
transition metal chemistry.

00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:16.077
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:27.390
The discovery and
history of ferrocene

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.652
and other organometallic
chemistry.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.020
Yeah.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.301
AUDIENCE: Relevant
uses of ferrocene.

00:09:39.598 --> 00:09:41.450
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
uses of ferrocene.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040
You guys performed the
acetylation of ferrocene.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.165
So why do we care that you
can add different groups

00:09:51.165 --> 00:09:53.180
to the ferrocene rings?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.392
It's a good thing to mention.

00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:57.600
So we've got some historic
and scientific background.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.850
What else can we put in there?

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.270
AUDIENCE: Like,
synthesis of ferrocene.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.318
So like, the equation's
of the organic molecules.

00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:09.110
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.110
AUDIENCE: And also the
acetylation of ferrocene.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:17.210
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
chemical equations

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.310
for ferrocene and
acetylferrocene.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.900
We got our balanced
chemical equations.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.025
Do we have any mathematical
equations that we need?

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.570
No?

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.320
Now, what techniques
might you talk about?

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:50.430
Yeah.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sublimation.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.588
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, sublimation.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.974
AUDIENCE: Inert
atmosphere [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:06.869
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
inert air-free technique.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.130
Yes.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.240
You want to talk
about that and why

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.920
we care about that
in relation to what

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.750
could happen to the
different components

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.610
of our ferrocene synthesis.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.170
What other techniques?

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.670
AUDIENCE: Thin layer
chromatography.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.190
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, TLC.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.845
And?

00:11:25.845 --> 00:11:26.654
AUDIENCE: Column.

00:11:26.654 --> 00:11:27.862
SARAH HEWETT: And the column.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.966
Running out of room.

00:11:36.966 --> 00:11:39.037
Yeah, TLC and column
chromatography.

00:11:39.037 --> 00:11:41.620
So how are you going to purify
your products when you're done.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.752
Yes, anything else?

00:11:44.752 --> 00:11:46.490
AUDIENCE: Filtration?

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.324
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, we
can talk about filtration,

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:57.130
how you're going to isolate your
products during the synthesis.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.930
AUDIENCE: Measuring a melting
point calibration [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.910
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
melting point.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.730
Melting point and how you can
use the melting point analysis.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.420
So what does the
melting point tell you?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.170
What information are
we getting from that?

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.550
Why are we taking
melting points?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.050
Yeah.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.350
AUDIENCE: Purity.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.250
SARAH HEWETT: It'll tell
you the purity, yeah.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.470
So you can compare it to
the literature values,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.930
and you can look at the
width of the melting range

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.820
to see how pure
your compound is.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.700
So all of these
things are good things

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.590
that you can discuss
in your introduction.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.110
And you don't need to go
into crazy amounts of detail,

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.710
but you want to give enough
detail that the reader will

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:37.950
know why those are important
for your particular experiment.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.450
Good.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.860
So a note on including
equations in a lab report.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.402
We said that you need to include
any mathematical or chemical

00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:49.080
equations that are going to
be used in the introduction.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.700
And the way that
you do this is you

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.320
give each equation a number.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.442
And when you write
it in your report,

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.150
you'll write either
the chemical equation

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.140
or a mathematical equation.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.940
And then over to the
right in parentheses,

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.732
you'll number them.

00:13:00.732 --> 00:13:02.370
And you'll number them in order.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.835
And you can either number
them both, the chemical

00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:07.710
and the mathematical
equations, sequentially.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.900
So any equation, no
matter what kind it is,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.000
just go one, two,
three all the way down.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.210
Or if you want, you
can separate and have

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.240
one of the types of equations
be in just regular numbers,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.010
and then the other
one in Roman numerals.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.765
Both formats are acceptable.

00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:24.390
And if you have any
questions about how

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.973
to do any of the
formatting things I'm

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:28.830
going to talk to you about, it's
all from the ACS Style Guide.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.610
So we have these books in the
lab if you want to borrow one.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.650
There's some information
online as well,

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.933
or you can talk to
me or John or the TAs

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.850
if you have questions
and can't find anything.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.430
But that's where all of
the information for how

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.810
to format things from this
presentation are coming from.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.802
So we're going to use ACS
formatting for everything.

00:13:46.802 --> 00:13:49.260
And then the important thing
is that equations and anything

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.850
else that you add, like
tables and figures--

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.170
and we'll talk about
those in a little bit,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.420
they can't stand on their own.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.260
You must reference
them in the text.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.970
So you can't just throw an
equation up here and not

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.553
talk about it.

00:13:57.553 --> 00:13:59.460
You'll have to throw in
a sentence that says,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.600
the reaction of copper nitric
acid as shown in equation 1.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.647
So the next part is
procedures and observations.

00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:11.730
So this includes what you
actually did in the lab.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.200
And the really important
thing about this

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.480
is that it has to match what
is in your lab notebook.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.310
So we already gave you
an idealized version

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.903
of the procedure--

00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:20.820
an idea of how you're
supposed to be doing it.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.710
But we want to know
what actually happened

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.370
when you did the experiment.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.990
So if you accidentally added
twice as much cyclopentodiene

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.400
as you were supposed to,
write that in your procedure.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.250
Don't just re-copy what
is in the lab notebook.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.290
Draw a diagram of any specialty
glassware that you used.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.110
So you don't need to
tell us piece by piece

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.310
how you assembled
your glassware.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.810
You can just draw
a picture and say,

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.150
I set up a distillation
as shown in figure 1.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.583
And that's all you need to do.

00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:50.250
Then you need to give
enough information

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.260
for one of your classmates
to recreate the procedure.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.552
So again, you don't need to
go into excruciating detail

00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:57.635
about how you injected
things out of a syringe.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:59.760
Assume that one of your
classmates is reading this,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.060
and they have the same
knowledge that you do.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.730
So if you say, I used a
syringe to measure this,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.438
or a syringe was used,
because you're not

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.480
supposed to use
pronouns, then that would

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.377
be enough information for one of
us to recreate the experiment.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:12.210
Include all the information
about a chemical

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.290
with the correct precision.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.460
So when you're
measuring-- and we'll

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.560
talk about this next
week in our lecture,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.690
about the different
precision of glassware,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.738
you want to include all
relevant significant figures.

00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:26.280
So if you're measuring
something that

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.500
has more than one
decimal place, include

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.780
all of the decimal places.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.780
So 5.2 milliliters of 8
molar nitric acid was added,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.095
not just 5 milliliters
of added in--

00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:38.220
if there's any specific
way that you added things--

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.220
like when you guys
added your aliquots,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.620
you did 0.25
milliliters at a time,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.245
you want to include
that so that people

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.203
don't add it all at once--
something like that.

00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:48.660
Or if you add
something drop-wise,

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.902
make sure that's included.

00:15:49.902 --> 00:15:51.735
And then you want to
give brief observations

00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:54.000
about the color, texture,
and state of matter

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.750
of your product.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.560
So you can say, I formed 5
grams of a white powder--

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.338
something like
that, just so that,

00:16:00.338 --> 00:16:02.130
again, when the reader's
are doing the lab,

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.380
if they get a white powder, they
want to know is this correct?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.453
Yes.

00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.370
And then if there are
any safety concerns that

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.650
are relevant or
unusual, those can also

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.540
go in your procedure
and observation section.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.767
So again, thinking
about ferrocene,

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.850
what are you going to write
out the procedures of?

00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:24.080
What was the first
thing that we did?

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.670
I guess not even
that you guys did.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.810
Cracking the cyclopentodiene.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.510
So even though you guys didn't
do that necessarily yourselves,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.343
that was an important
part of the procedure.

00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:44.243
So you should include cracking
the cyclopentodiene monomer.

00:16:44.243 --> 00:16:45.410
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.805
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:48.263
AUDIENCE: Like with the examples
where we draw the figures.

00:16:48.263 --> 00:16:54.450
So if we're drawing the chemical
equation for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.750
or drawing
sublimation, do we just

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.707
scan those into the lab report?

00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:01.290
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
so if you're going

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.130
to be drawing any pictures
of glassware or chemical

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.390
equations, you can handwrite
them and scan them in,

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.390
and insert them as pictures
into your lab report

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.470
if that's easier.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.780
You can also use, for
chemical equations especially,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.599
ChemDraw if you have access
to that on a lab computer.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.690
Or there's some free versions,
like MarvinSketch or ChemDoodle

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.910
that you can find online
that will give you

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.390
the actual chemical
structures that you can draw.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.140
And then you can just
copy and paste those

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.579
into your lab report.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.560
And also, if you
have ChemDraw, it

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.900
has a glassware feature,
where you can actually build

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.750
different glassware setups.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.500
So you can build the
distillation in there

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.980
if you wanted do.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.720
But yeah, if you
handwrite anything,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.812
like equations or pictures,
you can scan those in

00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:40.020
and insert them as a picture.

00:17:46.603 --> 00:17:48.770
So once you crack the Cp,
what was the next big part

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.776
of the procedure.

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:55.900
First thing you made.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.540
We'll just call it
synthesis of ferrocene--

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.548
of ferrocene.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.320
So that would be, yeah,
preparing the KOH.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.960
Preparing the iron chloride.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.950
Mixing them together.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.040
Shaking for who knows how long.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.690
And then your filtration
and your isolation

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.640
of the ferrocene.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:38.036
Then the next thing was the
synthesis of acetylferrocene,

00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:40.890
which some of you have done,
and some of you will do today.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.720
And then what are we doing
next week, in the last day?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.400
TLC.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.400
The important parts of
that are running the TLC,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.510
and also choosing your solvent.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.218
So you want to make
sure that you include

00:18:53.218 --> 00:18:54.490
both of those things in there.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.240
And then what's the
last thing we're going

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.810
to do to purify the product?

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.201
Column chromatography.

00:19:03.632 --> 00:19:05.340
So you'll have a bunch
of different parts

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.830
to the procedure for this
lab, and for most of the labs

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.350
that we do, especially since
they're all multiple day labs.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.712
So you will have a lot
of things to write about

00:19:12.712 --> 00:19:13.420
in the procedure.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.970
And so you want to keep those
straight between your days.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.980
And this is where your lab
notebook and the notes that you

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.438
take in the lab are going to
be super-important and helpful

00:19:19.438 --> 00:19:24.130
in writing up what is happening
in this section of the lab.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.887
The way that you write the
whole lab report, but especially

00:19:27.887 --> 00:19:29.470
the procedure and
observation section,

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.240
is in the third-person
passive voice.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.523
And this feels awkward for
a lot of people at first.

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:36.190
But instead of writing
something like, I

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.800
added 5 milliliters of
nitric acid to the copper,

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.920
it took this long,
and I used 6.2 molar

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.990
nitric acid and
copper shavings, you

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.370
would write it in
the passive voice.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.420
So, to a round bottom flask
containing copper metal

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.970
shavings was added 5
milliliters of nitric acid.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.210
The acid was added drop-wise
over the course of 15 minutes.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.870
So there are no real
actors in your lab report,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.500
except for the
chemicals themselves.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.600
So the chemical was added.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.670
By who, we don't care.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.340
You want to write in
the passive voice.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.230
And as an example,
here is an article

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.630
that was recently
published in JACS,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.120
the Journal of the
American Chemical Society.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.830
And you can see that this is
how a procedural section is

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.290
written for something that's
going to be published.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.060
And one of the ways
that you can do it--

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.430
you can either say in
the sentences, like,

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.660
10 millimoles of
2,4-Dibromobutyryl chloride was

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.767
added, or you can put the
quantities in parentheses.

00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:34.100
And in this case, they've
chosen to do it in millimolar.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.360
In your lab report, you can use
whatever quantity you measured.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.670
So if you measured it out
in grams or milliliters,

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:45.650
then that's what you should
write in your report here.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.670
So that's an example of
thing-- and something to note.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.010
This didn't copy over well
when I copied and pasted it.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.690
But you should
definitely always make

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.160
sure to superscript
and subscript

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.600
things as appropriate.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.740
Take the time and do it.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.225
Yeah, that should
go without saying.

00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:02.850
And one of the handouts
that I gave you

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.430
is also another example
of a procedural section

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.860
that has been written for
a lab that you guys are not

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.610
going to do.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.830
But it's another example
of how the language can go

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.530
and what it looks like
when it's all written.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.520
The next section is the results.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.250
So the results
that you collected

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.800
are going to be summarized
in your results section,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.940
obviously.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.270
This is best done using
tables or graphs if you can.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.260
And this is not the place
to analyze your data.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.720
So you don't want to
be making any comments

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.678
about it, saying, oh, I
got this terrible yield

00:21:34.678 --> 00:21:36.525
of 22% or whatever.

00:21:36.525 --> 00:21:38.150
You really want to
write that anywhere.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.483
But here, you're just
presenting your results.

00:21:40.483 --> 00:21:42.650
And then you will talk about
them and what they mean

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.610
in your discussion section.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.270
So what sort of
results are you going

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.160
to have for your ferrocene lab?

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.540
And if you're going to
put them in a table, what

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.670
would our table look like?

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.520
What are some good
headings for the data

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.340
that we will have
from ferrocene?

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.517
AUDIENCE: Yield?

00:22:02.517 --> 00:22:03.350
SARAH HEWETT: Yield.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.075
What units?

00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:09.080
AUDIENCE: Grams?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.560
SARAH HEWETT: Grams, sure.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.140
You can do grams, you
can do milligrams,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.690
depending on how successful
your synthesis was.

00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.625
AUDIENCE: The first column
should be, like, name?

00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:22.042
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah,
compound name.

00:22:25.953 --> 00:22:27.370
What other data
can we talk about?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.490
All the way on the left.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.690
AUDIENCE: Melting point.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.183
SARAH HEWETT:
Melting point, yeah.

00:22:33.183 --> 00:22:35.100
We'll throw that over
here because it's small.

00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:42.762
AUDIENCE: Molecular weight?

00:22:42.762 --> 00:22:45.220
SARAH HEWETT: Molecular weight
is not necessarily a result.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.410
So that would be
something that you

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.827
could include in
your calculations

00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:50.137
when you're doing your
theoretical yield calculation,

00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:50.970
something like that.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.120
AUDIENCE: RFs.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.105
SARAH HEWETT: RF.

00:22:56.105 --> 00:22:57.730
So you could include
that in the table,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.170
but it may be smart to do a
separate table for your RF

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:00.670
values.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.295
But that definitely
should be in there.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.380
Yeah.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.910
AUDIENCE: I mean,
you could include

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.818
qualitative-- like,
appearance, color.

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:11.610
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.960
Color or appearance.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.390
So you can say it was light
orange, dark orange, red.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.820
It was a powder, it was clumpy.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.222
You got big, giant
crystals of it--

00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:30.930
whatever you got.

00:23:35.378 --> 00:23:37.170
What other information
are we going to get?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.180
Related to yield, but what's
another way to report yield?

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.120
AUDIENCE: Percent.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.537
SARAH HEWETT:
Percent yield, yeah.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.508
Excellent.

00:23:57.508 --> 00:23:59.050
So this would be a
really great table

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.823
to include in your
ferrocene report

00:24:00.823 --> 00:24:01.990
with all of this data in it.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.540
Then what compounds are we going
to have all of this information

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.040
for?

00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:08.680
AUDIENCE: Ferrocene.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.560
SARAH HEWETT: Ferrocene.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.667
What kind of ferrocene?

00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:14.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
crude ferrocene.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.500
SARAH HEWETT: Crude ferrocene.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.190
What?

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.355
AUDIENCE: Purified.

00:24:21.355 --> 00:24:22.730
SARAH HEWETT:
Purified ferrocene.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.586
And?

00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:29.900
AUDIENCE: Acetylferrocene.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.608
SARAH HEWETT:
Acetylferrocene, both crude

00:24:31.608 --> 00:24:33.640
and pure of that as well,
pre and post column?

00:24:43.383 --> 00:24:45.800
You may not have all of this
data for all these compounds,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.357
but you should be pretty close.

00:24:48.357 --> 00:24:49.940
And if you made any
diacetylferrocene,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.982
you can put that in here,
too, if you have enough

00:24:51.982 --> 00:24:53.420
to collect off of your column.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.430
And you'll find out next
week if you enough of that.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.072
So yeah, those are your results.

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:01.780
Anything else that
we're missing in terms

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.070
of results for this lab?

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.660
No, it looks pretty good.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.720
So if you wanted to insert
a graph, which in this case,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.720
we don't really have any
graphs necessarily that

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.510
would go into your report.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.830
Yes?

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.430
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, where
does the calibration come from?

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.930
SARAH HEWETT: What
a great question.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.190
So you guys are making
the calibration curve

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.228
for your melting points.

00:25:26.228 --> 00:25:27.270
Where would you put that?

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.830
We have one vote
for calculations,

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.850
one vote for appendix.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.480
Any thoughts?

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.520
So the things that get
inserted into your results

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.500
section, or your
calculation section,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.300
are things that are
very directly related

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.950
to the goals of the lab.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:55.720
So if you need something to
get whatever data that you care

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.540
about-- so like in the catylase
that you guys are going

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.610
to be doing, you'll need
to make graphs in order

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.182
to get some rate constant data.

00:26:03.182 --> 00:26:05.140
So those graphs are
super-important to the goal

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.920
of the lab.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.690
Is a melting point
calibration curve

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.800
very important to our
stated goal of this lab?

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.810
Not necessarily, but
we need it in order

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.600
to get the data
that we care about.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.643
So that's something that
can go in an appendix.

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:21.060
And that would be an excellent
spot for your melting point

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:29.910
calibration curve, because
just like anything else,

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.410
if you put something
in an appendix,

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.700
you need to reference
it in your lab.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.420
Because why would you
include it anywhere

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.837
if it doesn't
matter for your lab?

00:26:35.837 --> 00:26:36.640
Maida?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.480
AUDIENCE: So would the procedure
for that go under procedures,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.360
or would we not include that?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.693
SARAH HEWETT: The procedure
for making the melting point

00:26:43.693 --> 00:26:45.832
calibration curve?

00:26:45.832 --> 00:26:46.790
That's a good question.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.550
Any thoughts?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.640
Put it in the appendix?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.950
Yeah, so again, that's
something that can probably go

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.992
in the appendix, because
it's not super-important

00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:05.310
to your actual lab, but--

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.372
AUDIENCE: What about in
the procedure section

00:27:07.372 --> 00:27:10.415
a list of every
instrumentation we use,

00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:14.438
it is typically written in
the synthesis section and then

00:27:14.438 --> 00:27:15.730
a list of different techniques.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.490
Can we put melting point
determination in there?

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.310
The machine's
calibrated x, y, z.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.783
SARAH HEWETT: Yes, that's
also a good way to do it.

00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:25.950
So there's a couple of ways.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.470
So one would be to
put the procedure

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.420
in the appendix with the
melting point calibration curve,

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.128
and have a note in
your procedure saying,

00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:33.500
see appendix for calibration
curve and the procedure

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.250
for generating it.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.330
Or when you are making
your procedure section,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.060
you can have different sections
for all of the different things

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:41.670
that we did.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:47.830
So you would have sections of
the procedure for the synthesis

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.210
pieces, and then sections of
the procedure for the techniques

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:52.820
that you use.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.600
And if you wanted to
put a technique section

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.190
for the melting
point, then you could

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.350
say melting point was
determined this way,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.098
and then talk about how you made
the calibration curve there.

00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.640
So there's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.410
As long as the information is
there and referenced well, then

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:17.020
that is acceptable

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.393
So if you are planning to insert
a graph into your lab report,

00:28:20.393 --> 00:28:21.810
if you want to put
the calibration

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.040
curve or any other
graph that you make

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.630
throughout the semester
into your lab report,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.010
you will insert it as a figure.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.650
And the way that you
reference your figures

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.743
is that you insert the
figure or the graph

00:28:30.743 --> 00:28:31.660
or whatever it may be.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.368
And then you need to
put a caption, which

00:28:33.368 --> 00:28:36.113
goes underneath the
figure or the graph.

00:28:36.113 --> 00:28:37.530
And even though
this is a graphic,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.850
it's labeled as figure 1.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.120
And then you number your figures
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as many

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.220
as you have throughout
your lab report.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.620
And then you need some
sort of description

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.553
of what the figure is or
what the graph is showing.

00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:50.970
And if it's a
graph, then you need

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.387
to make sure that
the graph itself

00:28:52.387 --> 00:28:55.530
has a title and axes that
are labeled with units.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.590
That goes without saying,
and a legend if you need one.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.780
And then all of that
information also gets

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.820
reiterated in the caption.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.370
The caption goes below the
graph, which is important,

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.650
because if you're going
to insert a table,

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.350
then the tables
also get inserted.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.200
However, they are called
tables, and the caption

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.418
goes above the table.

00:29:17.418 --> 00:29:19.460
So you want to make sure
when you have your table

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.930
that you have all
of your columns

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.810
with headings and with
appropriate units,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:29.390
and if you choose a unit that
gives you a reasonable number

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.700
of digits in your data.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.560
And if something is
getting out of hand,

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.150
or if you have one
measurement that's

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:36.692
on a different scale
than the others,

00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.078
use scientific notation.

00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.870
Or you can change the
units for one column,

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:44.420
but try to avoid that.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.250
So yeah, that's how you insert
a table into your lab report.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.097
Calculations-- so
any time that you

00:29:53.097 --> 00:29:54.930
present data that was
not directly measured,

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.580
you need to show how
it was calculated

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.690
with appropriate units.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.390
So when the data is presented
you should show an equation--

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.440
so the general form of the
equation that you're using,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.030
a sample calculation with
one set of your data,

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.440
and then the final answer.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.012
So if you're going to be doing
a calculation repeatedly,

00:30:11.012 --> 00:30:13.470
like percent yield you're going
to calculate percent yields

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.240
for a whole bunch of
different compounds.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.407
You just need to show the
calculation once, and then

00:30:17.407 --> 00:30:20.970
just show the yield for
the other three compounds

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.290
that you're calculating it for.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.820
If there are
lengthy calculations

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.200
that you can do in
an Excel spreadsheet,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.690
then you can include the Excel
spreadsheet in an appendix,

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.320
as long as in your report
you have shown a sample

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.070
calculation, and the
equations that you're

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.157
using to get all of the data
in that Excel spreadsheet.

00:30:38.513 --> 00:30:39.930
If you have a lot
of calculations,

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.300
you can include
them in an appendix,

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.980
as long as the data
is well-labeled,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.200
and the sample calculations
and equations have been shown.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.490
And again, all of this should
be in your report somewhere.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.560
And then if you need to
add more in an appendix,

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.435
you can if your report's
getting really long.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.990
So the discussion-- this
is where you finally

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:05.135
get to talk about your
data and what it means.

00:31:05.135 --> 00:31:06.760
So you will summarize
your key results.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.410
Explain any
difficulties or errors

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.340
that led to erroneous results.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.280
So if you accidentally
spilled some

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.100
of your ferrocene
solution, then you

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.090
might talk about how
that impacted your yield.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.380
Offer suggestions to
improve the experiment.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.210
So one of them could be
maybe change the glassware

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.170
that you're using if you're
spilling a lot of chemicals.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.427
Or if you have an idea
for different chemicals

00:31:30.427 --> 00:31:32.010
that we could use
that would be better

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.530
for the similar procedure,
that would be a good time

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.520
to talk about it, or adjustments
to the length of time

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.177
that you do something.

00:31:40.177 --> 00:31:42.510
Anything that you can think
of that may improve the lab,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.503
this would be a
nice spot to put it.

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:46.920
And then answer
any questions that

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.420
are posed in the lab manual.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.932
There are no questions
in the lab manual

00:31:50.932 --> 00:31:52.140
for the ferrocene experiment.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.510
But you'll notice, if you look
at the other labs throughout

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.385
later in the semester,
at the end of the lab,

00:31:56.385 --> 00:31:59.160
there are a set of
discussion questions

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.680
that relate to the
procedures in the data

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.390
that you will
collect in the lab.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.355
Do not just answer those
questions in a list.

00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:07.480
A lot of them are numbered.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.000
Don't go through and make
your discussion a bulleted

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.100
or numbered list of
answers to these questions,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.183
and don't just write one
sentence after the other.

00:32:14.183 --> 00:32:17.800
That's very obviously just
answers to the questions.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.660
Your discussion section
should flow nicely.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.540
This will be the longest
section of your lab report,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.520
and it should be the one with
the most thought put into it.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.183
So make it flow like a
nice piece of writing.

00:32:28.183 --> 00:32:29.350
Your TAs have to read these.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.870
They will appreciate
them much more

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.900
if you write with good
grammar, and in a way that is

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.840
intelligent and easy to follow.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.520
The answer should
tell a coherent story

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.280
throughout all of
your discussion.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.930
You can talk about
sources of error

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.347
that either came from
you or random errors.

00:32:47.347 --> 00:32:49.930
And we'll talk about different
types of error again next week.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.460
And then analyze your
data in your errors.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.585
So your calculations should
have already been done.

00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:55.588
So do not include
more calculations

00:32:55.588 --> 00:32:56.380
in your discussion.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.838
If you need to
calculate something,

00:32:57.838 --> 00:33:00.160
go back and do it in
the results section.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.020
But now you want
to analyze the data

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.710
and talk about what it means.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.470
So you've reported
your melting point.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.640
You've reported
all of your yields.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.020
You've reported your RF values.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.800
What does it mean?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.230
What does it say about the
success of the experiment?

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.345
Go back to your intro
and say, hey, this

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:14.720
is what I said I
was going to do.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.580
Did I do it?

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.790
And here is my data
to explain why.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.792
So what can we talk about
in the ferrocene discussion?

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:37.600
AUDIENCE: You get a sense
how our percent yield isn't

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.810
100% because of errors,
potentially because you didn't

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.415
scrape all the ferrocene off
of the culture dish, something

00:33:44.415 --> 00:33:45.340
like that?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.340
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.440
Yeah, so you can talk
about your percent yield.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.200
It's not going to be 100%.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.720
And why might that be?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.640
So different parts
of the procedure,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.260
where did you lose product?

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.120
Scraping it out of the round
bottom, that was really hard.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.703
A lot of people were
struggling to get

00:34:02.703 --> 00:34:07.090
all their acetylferrocene out
of the round bottom yesterday,

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.230
or scraping stuff off of the
ferrocene when you sublimed,

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.040
different pieces.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.060
So you can go back
again-- and this

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.710
is a good spot when
your notebook is

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.903
going to help you a lot.

00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:17.320
If you take good
notes in the lab,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.760
then you'll know, oh, yeah.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.500
That's where my product went.

00:34:25.593 --> 00:34:26.760
What else can we talk about?

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.366
AUDIENCE: After we do
chromatography experiments

00:34:32.366 --> 00:34:35.354
we'll have a percentage
of [INAUDIBLE] compounds

00:34:35.354 --> 00:34:38.342
and products.

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:43.050
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah, so
after you do your TLC,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:52.505
you'll have one way to tell how
pure your final mixture was.

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:53.880
Did you still have
ferrocene left

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.250
when you thought you only
had made acetylferrocene?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.650
So amounts of
compounds left over.

00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:12.260
So you'll have that
information from TLC.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.640
And from your column,
when you run your column,

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.098
and you separate
out your ferrocene

00:35:15.098 --> 00:35:17.750
and your acetylferrocene, you'll
see how pure your product was.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.220
And you can talk about that
and why you may not have

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.470
had a completely pure product.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.690
What else?

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.140
So what else is in our
results chart that we have not

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.188
discussed over here?

00:35:42.188 --> 00:35:43.230
AUDIENCE: Melting ranges.

00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:47.200
SARAH HEWETT: Melting point.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.325
And what does that tell us?

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.260
AUDIENCE: Same thing-- purity.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.302
SARAH HEWETT: Same thing.

00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:57.010
You can get purity.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:02.560
So was your melting point
too low or a wide range?

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.380
What else can your melting point
help you tell, to some extent?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.833
In our case, we're
using it to determine

00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:30.500
the identity of our
products, because we

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.350
don't have a lot of
really spectroscopic ways

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.650
of characterizing this product.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:43.225
So we are going to use it
to identify your products.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.020
So you can tell us how pure
your product was, and then

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:54.870
compare it to the literature
to see what the identity is.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.340
And hopefully,
your melting points

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.750
of ferrocene and acetylferrocene
are not the same.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.767
So you did, in fact have
some evidence that you

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:02.850
made a different compound.

00:37:08.387 --> 00:37:08.970
Anything else?

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.388
AUDIENCE: Maybe explain
the color and appearance

00:37:17.388 --> 00:37:18.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.072
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.140
So you can, again, bring in
some more of your results.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.350
Talk about the color and
the appearance of things.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.100
So your ferrocene and
your acetylferrocene

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:35.820
are different colors.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.362
You can talk about
why that might be,

00:37:37.362 --> 00:37:40.080
and how you can use
that to identify

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.852
your different compounds,
especially on your TLC plate.

00:37:42.852 --> 00:37:44.560
So when you run your
TLC, in your column,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.790
you'll be able to tell your
compounds apart by color--

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.095
hopefully.

00:37:50.095 --> 00:37:52.220
So yeah, and then again,
if you had any suggestions

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.270
for how to improve
the procedure,

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.680
those can also go
in your discussion.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.120
If you were doing something
and said, oh, this

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.912
would be much better
if we did it this way,

00:37:57.912 --> 00:38:01.550
or the sublimation, I found
this cool trick for it,

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.240
please tell us.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.320
And perhaps your
genius idea will

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.200
help us improve the lab for
future semesters of students.

00:38:12.287 --> 00:38:13.870
Then at the end,
there's a conclusion.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.180
So you briefly
summarize your results.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.055
This again is pretty
similar to the abstract.

00:38:17.055 --> 00:38:20.380
It'll just be about a paragraph,
maybe a little bit longer.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.880
A statement about whether you
achieve the goals for the lab,

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.590
then wrap up your
discussion section

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.812
and tie everything together.

00:38:26.812 --> 00:38:28.520
Based on the abstract
and the conclusion,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.020
if people read those
two parts, they

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.728
should have a generally
pretty good idea

00:38:31.728 --> 00:38:33.020
about what happened in the lab.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.500
And if they want details, then
they can read the rest of it.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.150
So conclusion--
again, wrap it all up.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.290
And then once you're
done with all of this,

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.248
go back and write your
abstract, because now we

00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:43.460
have all of the information
that needs to be neatly

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.400
summarized in our abstract.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.880
The very last thing that we need
to talk about is references.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.390
So at the end of
your report, you

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.140
need to list all the
sources that you use,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.610
but you also need to
cite them in the text.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.110
And this should not
be anything new.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.077
Do not use Wikipedia
as a reference.

00:39:00.077 --> 00:39:01.910
You can cite the lab
manual and the lectures

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.492
that's a good idea.

00:39:03.492 --> 00:39:05.450
And then there's also a
handout that I gave you

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:09.650
as to the format of how to cite
different commonly-referenced

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.100
sources, like books,
articles, things like that.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.525
The ACS Style Guide
also has information

00:39:15.525 --> 00:39:17.150
about how to cite
any type of reference

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.328
that you could
ever need to cite.

00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:21.120
The in-text citations,
there are three ways

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.180
that you can do them.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.500
So if you're planning to cite
this article in your lab report

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.560
for some reason, then you
would have a sentence.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.150
And then the first
way to do it is

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.400
to include the author's
name and then the year.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.520
You can also have
a numbered list,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.700
and you superscript at
the end of the sentence.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.430
Or the last way is
to put the number

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.180
of the reference in
parentheses in italics

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.305
at the end of the sentence.

00:39:45.305 --> 00:39:46.430
So up to you.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.270
All three ways are
ACS-approved, whichever one

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:55.263
you find the easiest
or most familiar.

00:39:55.263 --> 00:39:57.180
Appendices, we talked
about this a little bit.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.970
It's a really good way to
include relevant information

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:01.220
that doesn't fit well into
the body of the lab report,

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.970
or maybe isn't the most
important thing to the goal

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.320
that you're trying to achieve.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.840
They don't count
towards your page limit.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.020
So if your lab report
is getting long,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.450
and you can find things that
would go in the appendix,

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.012
that's not a bad thing.

00:40:13.012 --> 00:40:14.720
Don't put stuff that
should be in the lab

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.120
report in the appendix just
for the sake of giving yourself

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.370
extra space in the lab report.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.348
We will take points
off for that.

00:40:20.348 --> 00:40:21.890
Appendices have a
number and a title.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.940
So appendix 1, and then you
would say what's in appendix 1.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.510
Refer to that in the text of
the report like anything else.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.940
The format-- this is probably
the most important thing

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.982
that you guys care about.

00:40:32.982 --> 00:40:35.790
There's a 10 page limit,
plus or minus 2 pages.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.970
So if yours is significantly
shorter than 10 pages

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.770
or significantly longer, then
you will start to lose points.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.900
10 pages should be the
right amount of space

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.540
to talk about all of the
results in all of these labs.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.410
1 and 1/2 line spacing in
Word, one inch margins,

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.990
12 point Times New Roman
font-- pretty standard stuff.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.002
And then print it out.

00:40:55.002 --> 00:40:57.210
If we want an electronic
version, we will request it.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.590
But most of the grading
is done by hand.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.980
So we print it out, and we will
give you back the hard copy

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.150
the following week.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.090
Ethics-- we've talked
about this before already,

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.107
but do your own work.

00:41:10.107 --> 00:41:11.940
Don't use a lab reports
from prior students.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.898
Do not copy and paste
anything that you did not

00:41:13.898 --> 00:41:14.730
write yourself.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.310
Cite your sources, and do not
go looking for similar reports

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.010
on the internet.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.590
Some of the labs
that we do here are

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.400
similar to labs they
do other places.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.817
Some of them are
wildly different,

00:41:22.817 --> 00:41:25.170
so you won't find
anything, anyway.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.550
The TAs and instructors are
here to help you succeed.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.860
So we're the ones who are
grading your lab reports.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.278
So instead of going, looking
up some random report

00:41:32.278 --> 00:41:34.320
from some other person at
a different institution

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.280
on the internet,
come talk to us.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.490
We are the ones who know
how we will be grading it,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.782
what we are looking for, and
what you did specifically,

00:41:40.782 --> 00:41:43.530
so we can help you
write your lab report

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.062
the best way possible.

00:41:46.062 --> 00:41:48.520
Here is the point breakdown
for how most of the lab reports

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.960
are graded.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.720
You can see that the discussion
and the results portion

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.630
are weighted more heavily
than the rest of it.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:02.470
In the ester lab, you will
be identifying an unknown.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.960
And so that's only
for one lab, which

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.310
is why the range is on here.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.102
It varies from lab to lab based
on how much time and effort

00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:12.310
you're going to be putting
into each of the sections.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.190
Submission and
grading-- so labs are

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.620
due at the start of on the
dates listed in the lab manual.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.500
There is a locked box outside
of the stockroom in the lab,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.292
and that's where you
will turn your lab in.

00:42:23.292 --> 00:42:27.020
Do not turn your lab into
your mailbox or to my mailbox

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.550
or to John's mailbox.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.247
It goes into the lock box,
then the TAs will collect them.

00:42:32.247 --> 00:42:34.580
They will grade them, and
they will be returned one week

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.430
from when you turned it in.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.500
So if have a Monday,
Wednesday lab,

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.270
if you turn your
lab in on Monday,

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:41.123
you will be graded
the following Monday.

00:42:41.123 --> 00:42:43.040
When you get it back on
that following Monday,

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.430
you have one week to dispute
any points with your TA.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.020
So they'll give you back the
lab report with their comments

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.520
on it.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.740
And if you disagree with
something, talk to you TA.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.740
Try to figure out why they
graded it the way they did.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.547
If you guys can
resolve whatever point

00:42:56.547 --> 00:42:58.130
conflict you think
that you're having,

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.720
if the TA made a mistake,
if you made a mistake

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.460
and didn't realize
it, figure it out.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.350
If you can't figure
it out, then you

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.970
can submit your
report to me, and I

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.240
will regrade the entire thing
for either more or less points,

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.590
depending on how well you
wrote your lab report.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.535
So the last resort
is giving it to me.

00:43:16.535 --> 00:43:18.410
And then grades will be
posted on Stellar one

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:19.910
week after the
reports are returned,

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.200
once any point disputes
have been resolved,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.970
so that you'll be able to
keep track of your scores.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.350
Looking ahead, the final
report is an oral report.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.680
It'll be a chalk talk,
so no PowerPoints.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.170
You'll get a chalkboard
and any handouts

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.520
that you want to bring.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.800
It'll be you and
your TAs, and you

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.290
have to convince them that
you understand the experiment

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.562
and your data analysis.

00:43:41.562 --> 00:43:43.770
So this will be for the
final report of the semester.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.312
So it's a long ways off, but I
wanted to give you a heads up.

00:43:46.312 --> 00:43:48.012
Just something to
be thinking about.

00:43:48.012 --> 00:43:50.220
It's the same information
that's in a written report.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.012
It's just a different
way of presenting it,

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:53.330
and it should not be scary.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.410
You guys know what you're doing.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:55.910
And by that point,
you'll definitely

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:56.900
know what you're doing.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.920
And the TAs are, obviously, here
to help you guys with anything

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.820
that you need.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.940
And there will be
a couple of class

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.850
lectures later in the semester,
where the TAs will give you

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:12.210
beautiful examples of good oral
reports and bad oral reports.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:16.217
So if you want to come see
your TA's acting skills,

00:44:16.217 --> 00:44:17.300
put that on your calendar.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.370
Does anyone have any
questions about anything

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.410
that we have talked about today?

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.910
Yeah.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.950
AUDIENCE: For the equations
and figures that we draw

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:32.142
[INAUDIBLE] lab
report, or should we

00:44:32.142 --> 00:44:36.750
draw or scan them, and then
hand in the scanned drawing?

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.127
SARAH HEWETT: You should
scan them in and put them

00:44:41.127 --> 00:44:43.210
in your lab report, and
print it out all together.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:47.280
Try not to write extra notes
on the end afterwards, yeah.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.770
We want to have everything
printed so that it doesn't

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.970
get confused with the TAs
notes and people adding things

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.410
after they've been graded.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.680
Yeah.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.722
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about having office hours

00:44:58.722 --> 00:45:00.540
before having the
labs turned in?

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.318
SARAH HEWETT: Yes.

00:45:01.318 --> 00:45:02.610
AUDIENCE: Are those on Stellar?

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:03.990
SARAH HEWETT: They will be.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.360
So yeah, there will
be office hours

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.580
before every lab
report is turned in.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.240
And the TAs are going to--

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.952
they'll be posted on Stellar
next week once we schedule it

00:45:14.952 --> 00:45:15.660
with all the TAs.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.040
Great.

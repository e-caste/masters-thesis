WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Recall, please, that we
were discussing last time

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the fact that the immune system
makes a wide diversity of antibody

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
molecules. And, by the
way, a synonym for an

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
antibody molecule
is an immunoglobulin.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Recall that we used that word
very briefly. Another word we use,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by the way, was the word antigen.
And, an antigen is a functional term.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That was pretty funny. An
antigen is a functional term.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
An antigen is an agent that
provokes an immune response.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And, the term antigen doesn't
really refer to any specific

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
chemical structure. It
doesn't even have to be a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
protein. Antigen simply refers to
some chemical entity that creates

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
some response from the immune
system. We also use the word in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
passing, epitope. And, an
epitope refers to a small

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
region, for example, a protein
against which an antibody

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
has developed reactivity. And
if you recall our discussion

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
last time, a protein obviously
of some size has multiple distinct

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
epitopes, each of which can be
recognized by a distinct antibody

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
molecule. And,
for us, could we,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm sorry if I got all
this political discussion

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
started, thank you.
Thank you. An epitope,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
from the point of view of a
protein is an oligo peptide.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, a stretch of amino
acids of maybe ten, or 12,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or 15 amino acids forms an epitope.
And therefore, you can imagine

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
there are multiple epitopes
on the surface of a protein.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In fact, antibodies can sometimes
recognize the internal parts of the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
protein because protein can
sometimes become denatured

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or degraded. Indeed, as
we will discuss shortly,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
proteins also become
cleaved into oligo peptides.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These oligo peptides can come
from any part of the protein,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to state the obvious, and therefore
there might be internal epitopes

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that exist in a protein that are
not normally exposed by the native

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
protein. Recall that we were
dealing with the issue of how the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
immune system is able to create
a wide diversity of antibodies,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
immunoglobulins would share
in common a constant domain.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the constant domain is formed by
these invariant regions of the light

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the heavy chains. We call
this the heterotetramer in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
contrast to the variable domain up
here which recognizes the antigen

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that initially provoked the
production of this antibody molecule.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And, the immune system may at any
one point in time be making hundreds

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of thousands, maybe even millions
or tens of millions of distinct

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
antibody species that differ
one from the other by the antigen

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
recognition site here at this
part of the antibody molecule.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And recall as well that
since these are proteins, the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
antigen-recognizing pocket
is itself an oligopeptide,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
which combined in some complementary
fashion to whatever antigen

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
initially provoked the synthesis
of this antibody molecule.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
At the end of last time,
we discussed the fact that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
antibodies are made by B cells,
and the fact that in the disease of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
multiple myeloma, one
ends up with a monoclonal

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
disease, that is to say,
one of a vastly heterogeneous

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
population of B cells begins
to proliferate uncontrollably.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And now, all of its descendants
make a single antibody species.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And that single antibody species
consists once again of a heavy and a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
light chain, whose identity is
created by the antigen-recognizing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
pocket that it happens to carry.
And this begins to suggest a notion

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
of clonal expansion. By
that, I mean the following.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Let's imagine a scenario where we
start out with a naÃ¯ve immune system

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
where we have a whole
series of different B cells.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And this series goes here from 1-15,
but in fact this could go from one

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
up to a million. And
each of these antibody

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
producing B cells, or
each of these B cells,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
has in principle the ability to
respond to a different antigen.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Let's just imagine that. And
now, what we can imagine is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that an antigen such as, for
example, poliovirus comes into

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the body, and it is recognized
by two different clones of these B

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
cells. And that recognition, we
can imagine, acts as a mytogenic

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
signal, a growth stimulatory signal
for these two particular clones and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
B cells. It almost acts as
if it were a growth factor.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But of course, we're not talking
about growth factors here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We're talking about antigens,
including antigens brought into the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
tissue by a foreign infectious
agent. And therefore,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the recognition of the antigen by
these two B cells may thereafter

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
provoke their clonal expansion.
By that I mean to say that they

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
will preferentially begin to
proliferate whereas all the other B

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
cells, which are not in any way
responsive to that antigen will just

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
sit there like bumps on
a log. And, if there is,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
therefore, clonal expansion,
now there will be a much larger

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
number of cells in the immune system
that are capable of producing the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
antibody that recognizes
its provoking antigen.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Again, recall that this
number may go up to a million.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is just a great simplification.
Now here, we use the word plasma

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
cells. And in fact, if one
wants to get the nomenclature

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
very proper, the plasma cells are
the products of B cells which mature

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
into the antibody
producing plasma cells.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They are very close on
the same lineage of cells,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and what that means in the end
for us is if once there's an active

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
immune response, there's
been the preferential

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
expansion of certain sub-populations
of B cells and plasma cells,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and other ones of them which don't
recognize these antigens just sit

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
there are underrepresented in
the total population of cells.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Still, the fundamental
question that we posed last time

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
was the following.
If it's the case,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and it happens to be that each
of these B cells makes an antibody

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
having a distinct reactivity, a
distinct ability to react to one

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
or another antigen how do they make
so many different kinds of antibody

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
molecules. How do they know how
to do that. We argued that it's

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
implausible that the amino acid
sequences of each antibody molecule

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
are encoded in the germ line.
Why? Well, if there are indeed a

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
million or even 100 million distinct
antibodies can be made by the immune

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
system, clearly there
can't be 100 million genes,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
each of which is dedicated to
the production of a distinct

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
antibody molecule. And the
solution to this puzzle was

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
first worked out by Susumu Tonegawa
already more than 20 years ago who

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
happens to be in our biology
department. And what he discovered

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
was the following, that
the way that the antibody

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
producing genes are organized
is really quite extraordinary

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and unusual. Here's the
heavy chain of the gene,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and keep in mind that there's
a heavy and a light chain gene.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The heavy and the light chain
genes are in different chromosomes.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And therefore, the genes that are
responsible for encoding these two

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
proteins, the heavy and the
light chain, they're on different

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
chromosomes, and encode by
different genes. OK, so what Tonegawa

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
discovered was the following,
that the variable region of an

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
antibody molecule which is at its
end terminus is encoded by small

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
segments of DNA that are carried
in one very large genetic locus,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
an immunoglobulin locus. And
what happens in humans is the

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
following. There are in
humans rather than mice,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
this number should be 100 in humans,
there are 100 distinct V segments

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that are encoded in this antibody
locus. Each one is roughly the same

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
size, and they're located
in a large tandem array.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Similarly, there are in
humans 30 of these desegments.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The numbers change here if
one goes from mouse to human,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
but that's irrelevant.
And, there are six of the J

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
segments. And, much of
the antigen-recognizing

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
capacity, much of the variable
region is encoded in the green and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the blue region of the gene, and
the encoding happens as follows.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
There is a
combinatorial fashion the

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
random fusion of V, D,
and J segments. There are

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
specific, highly specialized enzyme
that will choose one specific V

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
segment, one specific D segment,
and one specific J segment,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
ostensibly on a stochastic basis,
a totally random basis, and fuse

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
them together. And
if that happens,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and the intervening DNA
sequences are discarded,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
then right away we can see
that through the combinatorial

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
mathematics that results from this,
there is the possibility for having

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
100 times 30, which is 3, 00,
times six, which is already 180,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
00 distinct combinations encoding
the reading frame of this particular

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
antibody molecule.
Here, I've just said V23,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I guess, D7, J2. But again,
let's imagine, which is

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
approximately the case, that
each of these combinations can

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
be fused with roughly
equal probability.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What happens subsequently, then,
is that this variable region

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
sequence, which has been formed by
fusion, is then the transcript that

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
comes from that is spliced to the
constant region which is towards the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
C terminus. So here,
when we talk about the V,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
D, and J segments, we're talking
about the segments that are encoding

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
this portion. Here's this
portion of the antibody molecule.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Keep in mind, from here on down,
we're talking about constant region

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
segments which are not affected
by these combinatorial fusions.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And, in the overhead I just showed
you, I was just talking about how

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the heavy chain gene is rearranged.
And what that results as a

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
consequence is the following.
This is just another version of

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
what I just showed you before,
where the V, D, and J segments

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
become fused randomly to
one another creating a V, D,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
J fusion thing, which then by
splicing is fused to the constant

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
region which here
is called C sub-mu.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
For reasons of why it's called
sub-mu I'll mention in a moment.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And this is the actual messenger
RNA which then goes into the

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
cytoplasm. And what we can
now imagine is the following,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that when the immune system first
begins, it randomly fuses whole

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
series of V, D, and
J segments together,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and all kinds of combinations.
The same happens in both the heavy

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
chain and the light chain,
although the light chain is slightly

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
simpler. But that's
irrelevant for us

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
conceptually. And then, we
end up having hundreds of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
millions of distinct V cells,
each of which has a different

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
combination of heavy and light
chains because keep in mind the

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
light chain genes are also
being rearranged combinatorially.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They're also being fused. And
therefore, we can have 180,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
00 distinct heavy chains, and I
forget the exact number for the

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
number of light
chains. It's a bit less,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but we can multiply those two
combinations by one another because

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
keep in mind that the gene encoding
the heavy chain here in its variable

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
region, and the gene encoding the
light chain in its variable region

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
are organized on
separate chromosomes. And,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
they're fused together. These
segments are fused together

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
randomly. So, the
total number of antibody

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
molecules we can make is 180,
00 distinct kinds of these.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And, I've just slipped up in knowing
the total number of these that can

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
be made, although we could figure
it out shortly if it were really

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
important. But once again, the
number is in the many thousands.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And therefore, overall, the
total number of distinct antibody

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
molecules one can make on
the basis of this is this.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Did I get the math right,
60 by 30, 18,000. It's 18,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
00. So, there's 18,000 distinct
of these that can be made,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and the number of these, I
think, is closer to 10,000.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I forget, but multiplied, let's
call it 10,000 for a moment.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
That's not the right number.
There's 10,000 different ones of

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
these, and 18, 00 of
these that can be made.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Multiply them together, and you get
the total number of combinations of

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
antibody molecules it could make
because it is the case that the

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
antigen recognition site
here is created cooperatively,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
collaboratively, by the heavy and
light chain. You had a question?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, the gene is rearranged, and
when the rearrangement occurs,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
on V segment is fused to one D
segment, is fused to one J segment.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And all of the extraneous segments
that are between them have been

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
deleted from the chromosome. So,
this leads me to a second point

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I wanted to make, and that
is that here we are dealing

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
with a process of
somatic mutation.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We talked about last time or the
time before last the fact that

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
somatic mutation is generally a
process that can lead to cancer,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
i.e. the mutation of germ line
genes that are in one way or another

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
corrupted by random
mutational processes. But here,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I'm talking about a
somatic mutational process,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
which is highly directed and highly
organized, and focused on creating a

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
series of rearranged genes that can
then serve as the template for the

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
production of an antibody molecule.
So here, let's just look at this

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
again. Here, I'll tell you,
there are many V genes. There are

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
many D genes, and there are many
J genes. And, this is the embryonic

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
DNA. After large segments of the
immunoglobulin locus are deleted,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and then the surviving V, D, and
J segments become fused in the DNA

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
directly to one another.
And when that happens,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the resulting B cell DNA can be
transcribed, and via splicing create

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
an mRNA where the region in between
the J's chain and the constant

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
region chain called, here
C, is further deleted.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, each messenger RNA has one V,
one D, and one J segment together

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
with a constant region segment.
There are yet other processes that

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
further diversify how many different
variable regions can be encoded.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
One of them is the following.
It turns out that the process by

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
which the V and D, and
the D and J genes are fused

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
together, those segments are
fused together, is a bit sloppy.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And therefore, sometimes the fusion
will occur creating a sequence of

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
nucleotides that has a nonsense
codon in. Sometimes it will create

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
a coherent reading frame that
creates yet another kind of amino

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
acid sequence there. And
therefore, this is not a highly

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
ordered process in the sense that
these micro-architecture of the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
points with the V and the D, and
the D and the J are fused is a

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
little bit chaotic. So
that creates even further

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
randomization of the
nucleotide sequence. And then,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
finally, once this gene has been
created, there is a process which is

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
called hypermutation, where
through mechanisms which are

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
not well understood, the
nucleotide sequence of this

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
region is actually
further changed.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It's mutated by certain enzymes.
For example, there's an enzyme

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
called cytidine deaminase, which
takes off the amine group off

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
of the cytidines in that region,
and thereby effectively converts the

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
C's in that coding region more
into having a T coding capacity.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
This happens somatically, and
here once again I'm talking

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
about a further dimension
of diversification.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
One of the dimensions diversification,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
first of all, the V and the J
chains rearrange independently,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
randomly, and stochastically.
Secondly, the joining of the

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
segments is a bit sloppy.
And thirdly, there is somatic

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
hypermutation. There's
an enzyme like this which

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
is actually an actively mutagenic
enzyme which fiddles around with

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
some of the C's in this portion
of the gene, thereby further

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
diversifying the coding ability
of the immunoglobulin gene that's

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
encoded by the cell. And what
this means is the following,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that if we imagine this scheme
here where each of these B cells

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
recognize it's a different antigen,
initially there may be 100 million

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
distinct B cell clones that are
created, each the consequence of a

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
different random mutation.
That happens early in the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
development of the immune system.
Thereafter, there are certain

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
selective processes there at play.
One important selective process is

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
the elimination of B cells that
have failed to make nicely rearranged

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
antibody molecules.
What do I mean by that?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I told you how sloppy the V,
D, J joining is. And therefore,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
many of these joinings could create
reading frames that are incoherent

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
with stop codons in the
middle. And therefore,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
those cells which happen to have
created antibody molecules which are

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
highly mutant and clearly
structurally defective are

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
eliminated. So, one
prerequisite for the survival of

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
these B cells early in the
development of the immune system is

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that they've learned how to make
functional heavy and light chains.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
If they don't, they're right away
wiped out. They're eliminated.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Here's another very important
prerequisite for survival,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
that these B cells don't make
antibodies that react with antigens

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
that are native to the body's own
tissues. What do I mean by that?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Well, one of the wonders of the
immune system is the following,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
that it can recognize foreign
antigens that are brought into the

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
body from the outside including,
for example, the epitopes on the

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
surface of polio virus particle.
It can recognize many different

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
viruses, surface antigens present
on the surface of bacteria,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and fungi, and all kinds
of other infectious agents.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But importantly, the immune
system also sees hundreds

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
of millions of different epitopes
of the proteins that are present

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
endogenously, native proteins
in our tissues. A priori,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
the native proteins, what's
called our own self-proteins,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
are perfectly qualified
to function as antigens.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And yet, the immune system rarely
develops strong reactivity against

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
them. Thus, the immune system has
the ability to recognize self versus

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
non-self. What do I mean
by self versus non-self?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Self are the body's own native
proteins, which are in principal

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
conceivably antigenic. Non-cell
are foreign invaders that

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
bring strange
epitopes into the cell.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And what happens is that B
cells, which make antibodies, that

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
recognize native proteins in our
tissues are, if things are working

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
well, rapidly eliminated early in
the development of the immune system.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
What happens if that elimination
fails to occur properly?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If it fails to occur, one has
the process of autoimmune disease.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And, there are multiple
autoimmune diseases.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Type one diabetes, early
onset diabetes happens when

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the immune system recognizes
antigens that are present in the

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
islet cells in the pancreas that
make insulin. Rheumatoid arthritis,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
which inflicts a large portion of
the elderly, happens when the immune

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
system recognizes antigens that are
present normally in the cartilage in

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
our joints. Lupus happens when,
it's an autoimmune called lupus

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
which is often fatal,
happens when the immune system

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
recognizes proteins in
many different tissues.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And once again, in
all of these cases,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
there is a breakdown of the
mechanisms governing immune

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
tolerance. And what do I mean by
tolerance? I mean the mechanisms

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
whereby the immune system
tolerates native antigens,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
but is conversely intolerant
of foreign antigens.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
The word intolerant is not used in
immunology, but I'm just using it

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
for the sake of explanation here.
So, immune tolerance is a very

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
important area of current
immunological research.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
We don't really understand why
we don't have much more autoimmune

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
disease than we do. And by
the way, only listed two or

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
three of the most common kinds of
autoimmune diseases that happen with

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the mechanisms that normally
guarantee immune tolerance failed.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And therefore, these B cells
survive are ones that make

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
functional antibodies and those
whose antibodies do not recognize

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
self-antigens. They are
permitted to survive,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and once again, we imagine
that those that happened to make

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
antibodies that recognize particular
foreign antigens undergo or enjoy

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
clonal expansion. During
the development of the

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
immune response, there is
a further diversification

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
of the antigen-recognizing domain
of the protein by hypermutation.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And therefore, descendants
of these initially

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
developed cells, which
have begun to expand because

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
they make an antibody, may
develop antibody molecules that

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
are even more able to bind avidly
to the antigen. It could be that

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
initially, these antibody-producing
cells make antibody molecules that

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
bind nicely to the antigen but
not really avidly. Avidly means

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
really tightly. And,
that's enough to get their

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
clonal expansion going, but
during the process of clonal

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
expansion, this hypermutation
creates further variants of these

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
cells, further mutates their
antibody producing genes so that

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
some of the descendants of
these cells will produce antibody

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
molecules that bind even more
tightly and specifically to the

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
provoking antigen.
And when that happens,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
the quality of the antibodies
is improved progressively.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Now clearly, the somatic
hypermutation once again,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
it's a random hypermutation. And
those clones of cells in which

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
the hypermutation created less
effective antibodies will not have

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
their proliferation stimulated.
Those clones of cells whose

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
antibodies make more and more
tightly binding antibodies will

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
preferentially have their
proliferation stimulated.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And as a consequence, they
will now be the ones that are

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
favored to yield the plasma cells
that produce large amounts of

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
antibody molecules. So, we
have now this very unusual

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and very interesting way by which
B cells and plasma cells are able to

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
create a wide diversity
of antibody molecules. Now,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
one of the interesting things,
actually, is the fact that this

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
constant region contains
one of a variety of distinct

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
constant regions. Initially,
when one produces the

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
first immune response, the
first immune response as we said

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
before produces a constant
region which is called CM,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and I had the right overhead
this morning. Ah, here it is.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Here's the way the genes
are actually rearranged.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Here's the rearranged V, D,
and J, and here's the splice to

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
the constant region. And
downstream are a whole series of

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
constant region segments.
What's the first one: CM.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I told you about that before.
Thereafter, C sub delta, C sub

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
gamma-3, gamma-1, gamma-2,
gamma-8, and so forth.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And therefore, the initial
event can create an ig-mu, an IgM

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
antibody molecule. The
mu region creates an IgM.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Later, as the immune
response develops further,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
this mu segment may become deleted.
And now, the splice may occur to a

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
delta or a gamma change. And
therefore, if the intervening

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
constant region is changed, you
might get what's called an IgG.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
An IgG is an immunoglobulin
which is produced when this

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
antigen-recognizing region becomes
spliced down to here or here by

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
virtue of the deletion of
these intervening constant

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
region segments. What's
the purpose of what's called

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
class switching? Because
these are different classes

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
of antibodies, because
they have different

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
functions. Note importantly that
when this class switching occurs,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
it has no effect on the
antigen-recognizing site of the

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
antibody molecule. Rather,
it affects the constant

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
region of the antibody molecule.
Well, how does that work? The

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
initially made antibody molecule,
I told you, is IgM. And in fact, if

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
you look at the structure of IgM,
it looks like this. Here's, let's

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
say, a B cell, and the IgM
molecule is actually not

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
secreted into the extra
cellular space like a soluble

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
antibody molecule. Here's
what IgM looks like from very

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
schematically IgM has our
standard antigen-recognizing site,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
but IgM is embedded in the plasma
membrane of the B cell exactly the

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
way that a growth factor receptor is
embedded in the plasma membrane of a

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
B cell. But keep in mind that I
just said that this IgM molecule has

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
an antigen-recognizing domain up
here, which is exactly the way we

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
described it before. So, the
antigen recognition is not

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
affected by whether we
have an IgM molecule here.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Only the location of the antibody
molecule, and as I'll show shortly,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
the function of this antibody
molecule is affected by this IgM.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Later on, descendants of this B
cell will mature into those that

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
secrete IgG molecules
into the plasma.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So, here's a maturation
that's going on. But look here.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Once again, the antigen-recognizing
domains of this IgG are unaffected

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
by this conversion. Here,
the constant region is

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
tethering the antibody
molecule to the plasma membrane.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Here's the
antigen-recognizing sites.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
After this maturation occurs, the
secreted IgG molecules, which go

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
into the solution, have
identical antigen-recognizing

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
sites, but now they're
soluble proteins. Well,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
you'll say, why does the
immune system do that?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And, it goes back to an overhead I
showed you just moments ago in which

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
there was a puzzle implicitly
created by the image on the overhead.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And here it is. Let's
look at this for a moment.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
What detail is now explained in
this scheme? What detail is now

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
explained? I told you that B
cells can be stimulated by certain

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
antigens. Let's imagine that each
of these B cells made only secreted

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
antibody, OK, instead of making cell
surface antibody because the cell

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
surface antibody, which is
being made in this scheme,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
is actually the IgM molecules.
Let's say this B cell over here is

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
making an antigen.
I'll just draw it as,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
there's the antigen, is making
an antibody against this antigen,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and it's secreting antibody against
this. And I'd just argue that the B

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
cell that makes good antibody is
favored. It has its proliferation

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
stimulated, right? That's
what we talked about.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
But if this B cell sends all
of its antibody into the plasma,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
how is it going to know that
it's making a good antibody?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It can't because all of the antigen
recognition is happening by the

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
secreted antibody. So,
what happens with the IgM

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
molecules. The first antibody
molecule this produced is IgM.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And, it stays tethered to the
plasma membrane of the B cell.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
It's a transmembrane protein,
and it functions much like a

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
growth factor receptor.
That is to say,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
when the antigen binds out here,
there are signals that are radiated

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
into the cell that induce the
proliferation of this cell.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And now, these cells that produce
the antigen-recognizing IgM

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
molecules on their surface can now
have their proliferation stimulated.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
That solves the puzzle here
which is created by this scheme.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
If all these B cells just made
secreted antibody like this,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
then there would be no way to
encourage their proliferation

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
because there would be no way
of telling this B cell you're

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
doing a good thing. Keep
making more of these antibody

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
molecules. Here, the
antigen-recognizing capability

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
is embedded in the plasma membrane.
And when an antigen binds this, the

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
IgM molecule's organized so that now
growth stimulatory signals are sent

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
into the cell which cause this
cell to begin to proliferate,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
producing more IgM containing
cells which are further stimulated

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
to proliferate. And
ultimately after this has gone

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
on for a while, there is
a class switching which

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
deletes the IgM region of the
gene chain region, and causes a

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
conversion to IgG. Again,
the conversion from here to

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
here doesn't change the
antigen-recognizing capability of

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
these two antibodies. It
just makes a cell surface

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
transmembrane protein or
a secreted protein. (pause)

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:37.000
No, the VDJ choice
happens in the

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
nucleus. It's a fusion of different
DNA segments, and when it's

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
transcribed, that fused VDJ is now
spliced to a constant region segment.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
The choice of VDJ is a fusion
of DNA segments. It happens in

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
chromosomal DNA. It results
in the deletion of all

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
the segments that aren't used.
So, all that's left in the

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
immunoglobulin locus of a B cell is
a DNA segment encoding V fused to a

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
DNA segment encoding D, fused
to a DNA segment encoding J.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So now, you have a new somatically
mutated immunoglobulin gene,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
lest there be any residual
confusion about that. So,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
you see the elegance of
this class-switching thing.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Now there's yet other constant
region segments that are used for

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
other purposes. For
example, when you have

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
allergies, there's an
activation of the igE antibodies.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
When you have secreted antibody
production in the colon,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
igA is used more for that.
So, different ones of these

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
constant regions are used for
different immunological applications.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
The IgM molecule, as I've
said, is used here just as a

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
way of telling the B cell that it's
done well by making the right kind

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
of antigen-recognizing site.
The real business of creating

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
antibodies is the soluble antibody
production, the immunoglobulins,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
or the gammaglobulins because the
vast majority of antibodies floating

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
around the blood plasma are
in fact IgGs. The IgMs are,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
as implied by this, actually just
largely tethered to the surface of

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
cells. So, this really
is an extraordinary,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
elegant way of creating essentially
hundreds of millions of different

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
antigen-recognizing domains each
created collaboratively between a

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
heavy and a light chain. And
once these antigen-recognizing

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
domains are created through
changes in DNA structure,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
then they can be used for different
immunological applications,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
driving B cell proliferation,
secreting soluble antibodies that

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
are used to neutralize
virus particles in the blood,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
or if they're hyperactive to create
allergic reactions or to create

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
immunity in certain regions
of the gut and so forth.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So, this class switching doesn't
change the antigen-recognizing

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
capability. It just changes the
utilization of how already-developed

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
VDJ segments and their
antigen-recognizing capability are

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
exploited by cells
of the immune system.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Now, one thing that's not really
clear by all this is how all this

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
develops at the cellular level
because what I've talked about until

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
now is called humeral immunity.
Well, we talk about somebody having

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
a good sense of humor. But
the actual original meaning of

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
the word humor in Latin was fluids
that were fluxing through your body,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
and were responsible for
your different mood states.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So, if you were depressed or
there just was a national election,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
there would be black fluids,
black humors coursing through

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
your blood. And if you
were in a good mood,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
there were other humors
coursing through your blood.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And that leads through this
etymology to the term of humeral

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
immunity, which is to
say the soluble immunity,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
i.e. the production of
soluble antibody molecules.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But I will tell you that there's
a second arm of the immune system

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
which is equally important, and
that's called cellular immunity.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And, to make a long story short,
and we'll elaborate it on Monday

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
briefly. Cellular immunity is
largely created when you have a kind

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of immune cell that's called a cell
rather than the B cells we've been

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
talking about until now, which
is able, and this cellular

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
immunity is among
other things, cytotoxic.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And, it can recognize a second cell
over here. Here's a second cell.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
This is its target cell because the
second target cell is displaying on

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
its surface certain antigens. So,
antigens are being displayed on

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
the surface of the target cell.
I've indicated them here as just

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
little, blue strokes. And the
T cell is able to recognize

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
these antigens on the
surface of this cell here,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
and is able to kill this cell
through a series of interesting

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
mechanisms. This doesn't involve
the intervention of soluble antibody

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
molecules. Here, we're
talking about one cell

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
recognizing another, and
it turns out to be very

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
important for antiviral defenses.
I've told you one way by which

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
antiviral defenses are achieved.
Soluble antibody molecules are

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
secreted into the blood plasma like
IgGs. They recognize an epitope on

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
the surface of a virus particle.
They glom onto that epitope on the

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
surface of the virus particle,
and they neutralize the virus

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
particle. And,
that's very important.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
We started out in our discussion
of poliovirus talking about that.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
But this also turns out to be very
important. Why is it important?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
For the following reason: when
this cell, let's say this cell is

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
infected by poliovirus
on the inside.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
It turns out, interestingly enough,
that the cell has a way which we'll

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
discuss of processing poliovirus
polypeptides, viral polypeptides,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
and displaying them on the
cell surface. In other words,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the cell can chew up some poliovirus
proteins, put them to the outside,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and tell the outside world, these
are the kinds of the proteins that

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
are being made right
now inside of me.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You the immune system can't really
look through the plasma membrane so

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I'm going to tell you this is
what's going on inside of me.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
There are poliovirus proteins
being made as we speak.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
On the outside of the cell,
these are displayed even though

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
poliovirus replication is recurring
exclusively inside the cell.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
A cytotoxic T cell here may
recognize these antigens on the

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
surface of the poliovirus infected
cell, and proceed to kill the cell.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Why is that interesting or important?
Because the cytotoxic cell will

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
kill the virus-infected cell while
the virus infection is still in full

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
swing. And therefore, by
killing the virus-infected cell,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
it will abort the entire
bioreplication cycle because the

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
virus won't have enough time to
replicate or proliferate inside the

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
infected cell before it happens.
It's preemptively killed by the

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
cytotoxic T cell. And in
fact, this way of eliminating

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
viral infections from our body is
as important and often more important

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
than the neutralization of soluble
virus particles in our plasma.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And all that gets now to have us
focus increasingly on the mechanisms

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
by which antigens are recognized and
processed so that the immune system

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
can begin to respond to them.
So, I want to get into that now,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
into the aspects in which we
look at the cellular arms of

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
the immune system. The most
important thing initially

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
in the immune response is that
let's say poliovirus particle is

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000
recognized and digested by certain
phagocytic cells of the immune

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
system. What's a phagocytic cell:
a cell that is able to gobble

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
up other things. So, a
well-known phagocytic cell is

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
a macrophage. And there you
can see the term phagocyte,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
macrophage. Phagos means
to chew up or to swallow,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
so macrophage might see a particle
like this surround that particle,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
and then internalize that
particle and digest it,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
let's say a poliovirus particle.
Macrophage could envelop a

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
poliovirus particle
and internalize it.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
It could do the same thing
with a bacteria. Here,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
we'll use as an abbreviation
for macrophage this.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
So, that's macrophage.
There are yet other even more

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
important phagocytic cells of
the immune system that are called

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
dendritic cells. Now, these
cells gobble up whatever

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
happens to be around
them. They don't care.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
They are promiscuous sewer,
gutter trollers. Whatever happens

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
to be around, they will gobble
up whatever happens to be around.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
They'll put it inside of them,
and now they do something really

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
interesting. The dendritic cells,
the macrophages, the phagocytic

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
cells, they don't digest the
internalized particles down to amino

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
acids. They digest the virus
particle down to oligopeptides.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Usually if 10, 12, 14 amino
acids long: very important.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So they don't make amino acids.
They make oligopeptides. Why are

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
they doing this digestion?
Because these cells are

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
exhibitionists and they want to show
the rest of the world what they've

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
just swallowed up. It's
really important to them.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Go figure. So,
what do they do?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
They take these oligopeptides that
they've just internalized and they

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
put them on the cell surface via
molecules which are called MHC class

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
2. MHC class 2 is the name of
these molecules, and these are cell

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
surface receptors. And,
these MHT C class 2 molecules

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
have included in them an
oligopeptide that has just been

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
produced by the proteolytic cleavage
of an internalized infectious agent,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
let's say. And so, the macrophage
has many of these MHC class 2

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
molecules on its surface, and
it displays to the outside world

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
what it has just captured in
terms of these oligopeptides.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And these oligopeptides are, by
the way, roughly the size of an

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
epitope. Therefore, this
macrophage is just so excited.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
It's like a little kid who
has just found something,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
so excited to show the world what
it's just found and gobbled up and

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
processed. And over here is a class
of cells which are called T helper

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
cells. And the T helper
cells are interesting in their

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
own right, right? The T
helper cells have evolved

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
through a mechanism that is similar
to and parallel to the evolution of

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
the B cells. As a consequence,
there are many different kinds of T

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
helper cells. Each one, so
TH-1, TH-2, TH-3, each of which

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.000
displays on its surface
a T cell receptor.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
What kind of T cell receptor does it
display? A T cell receptor that has

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
gone through exactly the same kind
of hoops that the antibody genes

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
have gone through. That
is, each T cell expresses on

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
its surface an antigen-recognizing
receptor just like the IgM molecule

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
except it's made by T cells and
it's created by these stochastic

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
processes of fusing DNA segments.
So, each of these T cells,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
and again, there are millions
of them, has a different T cell

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
receptor with a different
antigen-recognizing capability.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
And here's what happens
in the immune system.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Let's imagine, as
I say every year,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
that we're in a Middle Eastern
bazaar, and that Middle Eastern

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
bazaar, here are all the shops on
the sides on the sides of this long

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
bazaar. It's sometimes
called a shuk or a suk.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And here we're going to have a
macrophage or a dendritic cell

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
moving through the bazaar.
Hanging out in front of the stores

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
are a whole bunch
of T helper cells.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Business
is slow,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
so all these T helper cells
are just hanging out in front,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
and as is not the custom in this
region, let's pretend all the T

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
helper cells are girls just for
the heck of it. It doesn't make any

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
difference. And each of these T
helper cells is displaying its own T

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
cell receptor which has arisen
through stochastic mechanisms and

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
which recognizes a
different oligopeptide.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And here we have now the macrophage
coming through like a vendor,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
a street vendor, saying, look girls,
look at the epitope I just gobbled

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
up and produced.
Isn't it great? And,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
it's using its MHC class 2 molecules
to present, it's like hands,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
presenting the epitopes. It's
flogging them like a street vendor,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
and it walks down through this
bazaar, and each of the T helper

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
cells, they're congregating
along the sides of the road,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
and most of them say
look at this drip.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Look at the garbage he's selling
us today. I am totally uninterested.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
He was here last week
with some other chump too.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Let's hope he disappears quickly.
And meanwhile the macrophage or the

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
dendritic cell is very anxiously
trying to find someone who has even

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
the slightest bit of
affection or respect for him.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And this goes on
for a long time.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
And finally, the macrophage
finds a T helper cell over here.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
So, here's the T helper cell, and
it turns out that by coincidence

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
the T helper cell has on here
surface a T cell receptor that

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
recognizes the epitope that
the macrophage is peddling.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So, here's the macrophage.
Macrophage has on its surface this

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000
oligopeptide held by the MHC class
2 hands. So, here's the peptide.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And this T cell receptor which
I'll abbreviate TCR recognizes,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:00.000
binds strongly to the epitope that's
being flogged by the macrophage.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And this is, I will tell you
honestly, love at first sight.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
She says, oh, I can't believe it.
You're selling an epitope that I

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
just happen to love.
This is very exciting.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And all the other T helper
cells say, oh my God,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
what does she see in him? And
she gets all excited because

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
there's a direct complementarity.
In fact, to tell the truth, the T

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
cell receptor recognizes not only
the epitope but also the surrounding

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
amino acids in the fingers
of the MHC class 2 molecule.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
It's this constellation of things
that's recognized by the T cell

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
receptor and gets this T
cell receptor really excited.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And what does she do? Well,
we can't talk about everything

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
because this is polite company.
But most important for what she

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
does is she begins to
proliferate like mad. Well,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
you know, cells have a limited
repertoire of behavioral routines.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Next time we're going to figure out
how this leads to an immune response.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
So, we're going to be on
[intention? all weekend.

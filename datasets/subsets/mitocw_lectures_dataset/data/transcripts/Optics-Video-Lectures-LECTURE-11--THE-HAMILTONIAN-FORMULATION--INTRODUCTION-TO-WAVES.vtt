GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So you
guys walked in just in time.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.907
So today's topic is slightly
different, but before we start,

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:38.490
you asked a question
last time, right?

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.350
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.220
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: And
what's your name again?

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.947
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:45.280
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.200
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
[? Kalpesh, ?]

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.270
OK, again, so [? Kalpesh, ?]
my friend here, asked

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.440
me a question.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520
And I think you asked it in
the lecture before the quiz.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.870
So I answered it.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.310
I guess you were not convinced.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.500
So he asked me again just
before the quiz started.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.265
I told him, well, wait until
actually we, the class,

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.265
have convened, so we can
all discuss it together.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.140
So I was thinking how
to answer his question.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.970
And then I decided it was a
really interesting question.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.470
So I made some additional
slides to discuss the topic

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.853
that he asked.

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:22.520
And these slides are
not on the website,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.330
so don't look for them.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.120
You cannot find them, even
though I will probably post

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.690
them anyway.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.933
But for now, you
just have to watch

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.350
and participate
in the discussion,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350
and see what happens.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.400
So [? Kalpesh ?]
asked the following,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.330
when I started,
actually, the class, I

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.030
claimed that optical rays have
to satisfy Fermat's principle.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.590
So therefore, they must always
go where their path is minimal.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.670
So in the case of a GRIN,
I use the notation here

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.320
where the gray area in
the slide corresponds

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.590
to high index of refraction.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.650
The sort of whitest
area is low in index.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.490
So this is like a typical GRIN.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.520
You can imagine this profile
may be quadratic or something

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.380
like that.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.460
And what we said in
the class, and you all

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.770
believed me except for
[? Kalpesh, ?] I guess.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.040
What I said in the class is that
if you have a ray that enters

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.740
this medium sort of off
axis, like shown here,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.730
the ray will actually
bend inwards.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.240
So all of the rays will come to
a focus somewhere around there.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.200
But [? Kalpesh ?] asked,
why doesn't it do this?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.488
I mean, the rays here
seems to actually--

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:42.280
it seems to do the
wrong thing, doesn't it?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.020
It seems to go towards
the high-index area,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.150
whereas the minimum
path principle

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.440
would suggest that the ray
should go outwards like this,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.040
towards the low-index area.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.860
So the question is,
what will the ray do?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.270
Will it do this or that?

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.680
We know from experience--

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.760
I mean, we know from experience,
from experiment, I should say--

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.320
that gain optics do focus.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.470
So we know that physics
actually behaves like this.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.200
But the question is, how is that
consistent with our description

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.260
of the physical system?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.177
What is going on here?

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.480
So that is
[? Kalpesh's ?] question.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.790
And what I said when he asked
it in class, more or less--

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.740
I cannot remember
exactly what I said--

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.400
but I said to properly
contemplate the answer,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.372
we must consider
not just this ray.

00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.080
If we just have this
ray, we don't really

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.000
know whether the ray will go.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.860
But we also have another
ray, the one that is on axis.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.510
Now these two
rays, they actually

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.700
originated at the same point.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.020
Where did they originate?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.870
At infinity, somewhere far
out to the left over here.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.930
And what I said is that
basically these rays,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.760
because this ray goes through
a longer optical path,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.060
because it is entered
in a high-index medium,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.840
this has too much,
its optical path.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.320
So this ray actually
enters a lower index.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.380
So therefore, it starts
with a sort of predicament

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.410
that points to a
smaller optical path.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.970
So in order to
catch up, in order

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.380
to match the longer
optical path of this ray,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.270
this ray, the sort
of off-axis ray,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.880
must follow along at
a geometrical distance

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.770
so that the longer geometrical
distance times the lower index

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.426
kind of will balance,
will compensate.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.720
So this is where we left it.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.510
But then [? Kalpesh ?] came
back to me at the quiz,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.410
and he told me, I
don't believe it.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.512
You want to rephrase
your question?

00:04:58.512 --> 00:04:59.680
AUDIENCE: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.180
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, so I
presented your objection well.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.170
So first of all, does anybody
else from here or from Boston

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.610
have some additional
insight about this?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.220
I can go back to the original.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.230
We'll call it the
[? "Kalpesh ?] Question."

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.390
Yes.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:28.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.728
AUDIENCE: We didn't
hear the question.

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:32.520
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Is your button pushed?

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.020
Yes.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.400
You have to make sure
that the red light is on.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.330
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.940
Yeah, in the standard
case of an interface,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.450
we have a ray propagating
from left to right

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.810
and we have an interface,
which is top to bottom.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.970
But in this case,
the interface could

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.390
be considered to be left
to right, couldn't we?

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.990
Because the refractive index
change is from top to bottom.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.020
So the interface--

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.170
I'm just thinking that if we
consider the interface to be

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.060
from left to right,
then the normal

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.680
will be from top to bottom.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.567
And still, the Snell's law will
lead us to the correct answer,

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:10.400
correct [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.442
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:14.270
You can actually--
by the time you

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.510
reach here whether the
ray has already been,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.690
you can make that argument.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.320
Because now the ray is really--

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.445
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:22.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.640
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
But the question

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.580
is, why should the ray start
bending inwards to begin with?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.410
Why should it not bend this way?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.520
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: And if
it starts bending this way,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.160
then Snell's law also said
that it should go like this.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.270
So there's something amiss here.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.030
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:42.850
So there's no doubt--
as I said, there's

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.580
no doubt that the correct
physics is this one.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.520
The question is, is
our model correct?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.760
Is our claim, all this stuff we
developed about optical paths

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.640
and so on, does it really
agree with the physics?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.530
So I don't hear any-- any
other comments or objections

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.060
about this?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:13.280
Or-- so let's go with
a little bit more care

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.190
through this argument.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.820
What is happening.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.210
Let's take out the medium,
so there's nothing now,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.840
just free space.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.770
So the rays started at infinity.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.380
They're heading
towards infinity.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.710
Everybody's happy with a
straight path, because clearly,

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.370
the straight line
in uniform space

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.700
is the shortest
between two points.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.130
And clearly, these two rays--

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.830
they never really meet, but
we say they meet at infinity

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.510
at the left and they also meet
again at infinity to the right.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.430
And they will have traversed the
same optical path by the same--

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.470
by the time they meet
again at infinity.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.640
Now, you might ask, well,
what does it really mean?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.680
I mean, after all, the
path itself is infinite.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.890
What does it mean they
travel equal infinite paths?

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.260
Well, I can get, actually,
around this problem

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.550
pretty easily because I can
actually put some boundaries

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.870
to the left and to the right.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.170
And I can keep these boundaries
at a finite distance.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.210
Then you can definitely
measure the optical path.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.240
Then you can start
moving the boundaries

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.990
farther away to the left and
farther away to the right.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.500
The optical paths remain the
same as I move the boundaries.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.570
And I can continue this
process until the boundaries

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.360
are really, really very far.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.900
This is mathematically really
what we mean by "infinity."

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.789
So I can get around
this difficulty.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.510
I can certainly talk
about equal paths,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.590
even if the paths are
actually infinite.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.810
This is sort of a
technicality, but nevertheless

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.870
an important one so we know
that we're on solid ground.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.075
So I hope I have
convinced you that Fermat

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:59.420
is happy in this
case of free space,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.450
because the rays
indeed propagate

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.000
through the minimum
path, and indeed, they're

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.740
all equal in terms of path.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.980
Now, this is really
not anything new.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.120
This is what I said before.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.420
And basically, this says
that the longer geometrical

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.550
path actually gets to be
multiplied by a lower index,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.980
so therefore, by the time
the rays meet again here,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.710
they still have
equal optical paths.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.980
Because the path to the left
is equal-- they both came

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.040
from infinity-- then the
two trajectories here,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.710
if you sort integrate the
optical path all along,

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.060
you would get equal answer.

00:09:52.597 --> 00:09:53.180
Are you happy?

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.714
Maybe push the button in.

00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:06.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Instead of a wave coming

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.590
towards a whole cross-section
of the GRIN lens,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.940
suppose if you have a small spot
coming only towards the top.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.950
So will it go towards
up in that case?

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.450
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So the question

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.370
is, suppose I take out this ray.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.800
Will the ray-- will
this thing also focus?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.550
What do you think?

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.210
AUDIENCE: I think we have only
a single ray towards the top,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.200
which is coming towards
the lower refractive index,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.980
then it should go towards
the lower refractive index

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.680
because it doesn't need to
match with the same phase

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.960
as the center wave.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.700
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, let's not quite

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.040
argue about a single
ray, because there's

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.170
no such thing as a single ray.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.630
If you illuminate a very, real
infinitesimal optical spot

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.260
over here, as we will learn in
wave optics, what you will get

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.020
is not a sort of
straight line of light,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.860
but you will get a very
strong diffraction.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.610
So what will happen if you
illuminate a single spot here

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.310
is the light will spread
violently into the GRIN.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.400
And then what will happen is
a kind of a complicated issue.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.870
So the way, essentially
by claiming the fraction,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.700
I got around the
problem that you're

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.870
posing, because as long as I
have a finite pencil of rays

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.780
coming in here, then the
same thing will happen,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.620
because I can always
compare two rays that enter

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.090
at slightly different indices.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.770
Then the same argument follows.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:55.130
So this pencil will also
kind of focus in the same--

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:01.510
so basically, I can remove
parts of that ray diagram

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.970
and the same thing will
still happen according

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.130
to geometrical optics.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.180
Diffraction says
differently, but according

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.930
to geometrical optics, I can
remove portions of these rays

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.362
and still have focusing.

00:12:15.362 --> 00:12:17.620
There's another objection
that I haven't had yet.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.890
I'm not finished.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.000
I am not satisfied
that I answered

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.572
[? Kalpesh's ?] question yet.

00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:29.530
And I see that [? Kalpesh ?]
is also skeptical,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.570
and I hope someone--

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.850
I have another slide to
bring up the objection,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.190
but I'm wondering if
someone will bring it up,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.320
or maybe another objection.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.940
At least there's one
objection that I thought of,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.140
but there may be others.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.000
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.390
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.260
AUDIENCE: Why is it that
the ray on top bends

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
to slow down to
meet the ray that's

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.050
traveling through the denser
medium versus both of them

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.188
traveling to the less
dense optical medium,

00:13:03.188 --> 00:13:04.230
because that could also--

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.570
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's the objection.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.420
That's exactly the objection.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.160
So the objection is who says
that the central ray should

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.530
go straight?

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.150
I sort of silently
took it for granted

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.050
that the central ray
here goes straight,

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.010
and therefore,
this other ray has

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.620
to race in order to meet it.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.970
Why don't the two
rays go like this?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.730
Is this your question?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.170
I mean, yes.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.493
Why don't the two rays-- why
don't they both do like this?

00:13:36.493 --> 00:13:38.160
They seem to be doing
the correct thing.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.735
They seem to be both going
toward the lower index.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.430
We know again-- we can argue
that this would happen,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.440
but we know from physics
that this does not happen.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.790
So what is the physical--

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.400
AUDIENCE: That can't
possibly happen by symmetry.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, thank you.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.500
Accurately, it is not
a question of symmetry

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.800
because indeed, in
this case, I assume

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.760
that the refractive
index is symmetric.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.870
However, now let me see if I
can do this without revealing

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.830
my next slide.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.750
However, I can make an
asymmetric index profile.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.390
So this is a
simulation of the GRIN

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.840
with a symmetric
quadratic index.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.850
Here, I made the
profile asymmetric.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.540
So basically, this
is the equation here.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.430
I should simply draw it,
except I don't have a marker.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.410
Anyway, basically here,
the index of refraction

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.290
is a parabola that
has a different slope

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.590
above and different slope below.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.190
So you see that even though
this is asymmetric, stubbornly,

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.400
the central ray
still goes straight.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.130
Therefore, it is not
symmetry which makes

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.011
the previous case impossible.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.150
AUDIENCE: But, well, I said
"symmetry," but if you go

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.310
to your next one, that
ray that's going straight

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.630
along the center--

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.130
is it gone?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.948
Yeah, that ray goes
straight, doesn't it?

00:15:34.948 --> 00:15:35.990
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yep.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.640
AUDIENCE: And that's
because there's

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.900
no transverse gradient in
the refractive index where

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.210
it's propagating, I guess.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.628
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, yes.

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:48.170
That is true.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.360
There's no movement to push it.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.580
Yeah, and that, I agree with.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.880
However, that really still
does not answer his question,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.165
because the reason
momentum works,

00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:03.040
the reason we apply
Snell's Law, for example,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.030
is because we claim
path minimization.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.670
So I suppose you
could argue this way.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.110
I have another
argument, actually,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.073
why this ray must go straight.

00:16:15.073 --> 00:16:16.990
Actually, I don't know
if it must go straight,

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:23.290
but then another argument why
basically this is impossible,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.065
why this is
physically incorrect.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.260
AUDIENCE: If you do that, isn't
it true that the bottom ray's

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.860
path is still longer than
the top ray's path because

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.750
of the index of refraction is
low, and then it's just low

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.290
all the way, and--

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.542
yeah.

00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:49.750
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Exactly.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:57.190
If you do that,
there is no way ever

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.550
that this ray will catch up.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.910
Because this ray
now, not only is it

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.060
going through a higher
index of refraction,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.619
it is also following a longer
geometrical trajectory.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:15.970
So therefore, if these
two rays ever meet again--

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.555
they might meet at
a finite distance.

00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:19.180
The way I drew them
here, at some point

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.690
they will meet again, or
they might meet at infinity.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.599
They might somehow become
parallel and meet again

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.530
at infinity.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.410
But no matter what,
this ray over here

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.650
has traveled the
longer optical path.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.680
And now that is a clear
violation of Fermat.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.740
So we basically arrived
at an impossibility.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.190
So this is physically,
then, incorrect.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:50.790
That is the reason why the
rays have to bend inwards.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.080
And so the proper interpretation
of Fermat's principle--

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.270
and actually, the book has
an interesting discussion

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.300
about this--

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:04.260
we can claim, yes, that Fermat
minimizes the optical path,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.520
but perhaps, at least
linguistically a more precise

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.110
definition is that
Fermat requires

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.520
that the path of the
rays is stationary.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.190
Now, "stationary"
in mathematics--

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.480
what it means is that if
you perturb it in some way,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.030
you will get a bigger answer--

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.800
if you perturb it in anyway.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.485
So remember-- I wish
I had the marker.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.823
I think I can just
use a pen, though.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.570
Let's try with a pen, and
you guys tell me in Boston

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.410
if you can see it.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.670
Remember with Fermat,
we did this analogy.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.090
We said-- you can
see it, right--

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:56.440
we said-- I'm
sorry, I should have

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.220
said remember with Snell's Law.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.470
Snell's Law says that
the ray must do something

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:10.670
like this in order to connect
this point to this point.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.480
So mathematically,
what we derive

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.300
is that any other possibility--

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:27.640
this, this, this, this,
and also, why not this?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.510
These are all different
possible ray trajectories.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.930
There's a mathematical tool.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.590
It's called "calculus
of variation,"

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.550
which does a miraculous thing.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.570
It somehow compares all of
these possible trajectories,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.920
and then it arrives at
the minimum trajectory.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.830
And it tells us, no, no.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.010
No matter what-- these are
infinite possibilities.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.190
That you can imagine.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.530
But this tool,
calculus of variations,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.490
actually tells us
eventually that all of these

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.220
give us a longer
total optical path.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.120
And the only true one, if you
wish, the one that minimizes,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.600
the stationary one, is the
one that I drew kind of bolder

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.910
here.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.160
So this is the proper
way to interpret Fermat.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.560
It is not that a single
ray will actually

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.410
look for the lower
index of refraction.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.940
It is actually
that when you have

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.270
a bundle of rays that
share a common beginning

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.140
and a common end,
then the trajectory

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.700
that these rays will follow will
be such that they're all equal,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.850
and that this trajectory now
is stationary, in the sense

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.620
that if you were to
perturb it in any way--

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.070
if you were to move some
of these rays up, or down,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.020
or bend them, or
whatever-- you would end up

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.220
getting a longer trajectory.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.860
That's the proper
interpretation of Fermat.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.120
So this is actually a
very interesting topic.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.100
And I confess that
when I was a student,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.290
I was also bothered by this.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.190
I mean, the rays seems to
be doing the wrong thing,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.960
after all.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.070
It seems to be going really
the way it shouldn't go.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.700
Why?

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.000
The reason is as we just
described-- because the path

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.170
has to be stationary.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.170
The bottom line out of
this, which will actually

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.730
be useful in our
ensuing discussion

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.080
of Hamiltonian optics, is
that the index of refraction

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.713
is acting a little
bit like gravity.

00:21:23.713 --> 00:21:25.130
Actually, it's
acting like gravity

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.480
more than you would think.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.150
The index of refraction seems
to be attracting the rays, which

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.850
is, again, a little bit
counterintuitive if you

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.210
interpret Fermat
as a minimum path.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:48.590
But after we went through this
explanation, it makes sense.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:54.790
The index of refraction pretty
much collects rays near it.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.892
Yes, there's a question.

00:21:55.892 --> 00:21:56.475
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:56.475 --> 00:22:01.640
George, I think if you consider
the interfaces left to right,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.540
the geometric works out.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:11.090
And so if we assume any
ray coming like this,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.470
going from left bottom to
top right, then it will--

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.580
it is going from a higher
index to lower index, which

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.670
means it will tend to increase
its angle with respect

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.240
to normal.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.400
So it will keep
bending like this.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.990
And at some point, there will
be total internal reflection,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.545
and it will bend towards the--

00:22:29.545 --> 00:22:30.110
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right, yeah.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.430
Doesn't happen
here, for example.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.040
If this ray continues--

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.020
AUDIENCE: And then
again, it will--

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.650
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
It will kind of bend.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:33.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.270
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.380
AUDIENCE: So maybe--

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.833
I mean, that's just another
way of looking at the problem,

00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:40.250
that if you consider
the interface

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.420
to be normal to the change in
the refractive index, then--

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:45.957
yeah.

00:22:45.957 --> 00:22:46.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.582
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Actually, that's true.

00:22:48.582 --> 00:22:51.080
Snell's Law also
justifies this attraction.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.190
I mean, the point that
is really hard to swallow

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.270
is why this ray starts bending
inwards at this interface.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.760
After it has started,
then it has to fall,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.850
because Snell says
that it should fall.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.210
So that is consistent.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.560
So really, this acts--

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.440
you can think of a
mechanical analogy, which

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.230
would be like imagine
that you take a tube

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.360
and you cut it in half.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.700
So now you have
these hollow sphere.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.540
And then you launch a billiard
ball into that surface.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.480
What will the billiard ball do?

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.680
It will spin.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.070
It will go down, and then up
again, and then down again,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.870
and spin, and spin, and spin.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:35.710
So basically, the
surface in this sort

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.760
of mechanical analogy, the
equivalent of the surface shape

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.605
is the index of refraction here.

00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:44.230
And of course, the billiard ball
is subject to its own gravity.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.080
And the surface--
how do you call it,

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.840
the [INAUDIBLE] contact
from the surface,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.990
and so on, and so forth.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:57.550
But the bottom line is that
this is a mechanical analog.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.930
I'm sorry, this is--

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.690
whatever, the mechanical
analogy for this

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.885
is gravity, attraction.

00:24:07.861 --> 00:24:12.153
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:13.570
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, provided

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.852
you define the gravitational
potential appropriately

00:24:16.852 --> 00:24:18.310
in terms of the
initial refraction.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.395
And this will actually come up
near the end of the Hamiltonian

00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:21.280
lecture.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.750
So I will show you
exactly the formula.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.350
Did everybody hear his question?

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.345
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:27.345 --> 00:24:29.220
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, could you repeat it?

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
asking, is the analogy

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.000
between the gravitational force
and the reflective [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.500
complete?

00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:39.650
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah,
and you have an answer.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.920
OK, now that I have a
marker, let me also answer--

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.070
so in this case, what I did
is on the left-hand side,

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:54.370
we have the familiar
quadratic index profile.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:02.130
So this is n0 minus the some
coefficient times x squared.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.520
On the right-hand
side, what I did is

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.460
I chose an index that
[INAUDIBLE] like this.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.480
I'm exaggerating,
but basically, it

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.550
is still a parabola on
the left and the right,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.280
but has a different curvature
on the left and the right.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.847
And the point here is
that the central ray still

00:25:22.847 --> 00:25:23.430
goes straight.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.320
Of course, this is
a terrible lens.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.900
It does something
really horrible

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.472
back here, does
not focus properly,

00:25:28.472 --> 00:25:29.430
and so on and so forth.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:35.670
But the only reason I did this
is to show that the ray here

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.370
goes straight not because
the index of refraction

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:43.300
is symmetrical, even though
Colin's point is well taken.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.550
I mean, the reason it
goes straight here--

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.070
again, you can think of it
in terms of Snell's Law.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.350
It does not want to go
this way, because it

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:58.880
would bend to a longer optical
path then the ray next to it.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.320
It does not want to go
down, because again, it

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.320
would end up with a longer
optical path with respect

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.820
to the ray below it.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.810
So therefore, it
has to go straight.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.360
Can you imagine a situation--

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.380
is it always straight?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.620
Can I actually bend this ray?

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.140
What would I have to do to
make the central ray bend?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.180
Actually, Colin
answered it already.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.440
Yeah, they cannot see you.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.010
Can you--

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.287
AUDIENCE: Curve
the whole profile.

00:26:36.287 --> 00:26:38.620
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So you
have to put a gradient along

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.480
z in the index of refraction.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.650
Then if the ray sees a tilted
interface, which basically

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.100
means a gradient of the index of
refraction here, it will bend.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.380
Because again, Snell
tells it to bend.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.660
But since there is no--

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.350
since here, the index
has no z dependency,

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.700
then the ray must go straight.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.430
So first of all, thanks to
[? Kalpesh ?] for asking

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.930
this question,
because it turned out

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.650
to be a really,
really helpful one.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.750
And in addition to that, today
we have kind of two more things

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.650
to do.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:02.120
So I need to really finish the
Hamiltonian optics discussion,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.360
and then we'll start
talking about wave optics.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.540
So we'll see how far we go.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.640
And I have to make some
announcements near the end.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.160
So I will try to save about
five minutes near the end

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.750
for my announcements.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.830
So last time, we were discussing
gradient index optics.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:37.860
And just to briefly
remind you, this

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.630
is actually what prompted
the [? Kalpesh ?] question.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:44.100
We went through this derivation
where we had the gradient index

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.670
element.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:50.970
I will stop saying gradient
index it's difficult for me

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.180
to pronounce--

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.180
a GRIN light.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.050
So we had the GRIN element, and
we did this simple derivation

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.000
which basically
said that this GRIN

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.100
element is acting like a lens.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.850
And again, with our
newfound wisdom,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.250
it is acting like
a lens by virtue

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.795
of the attraction of
the rays by the origin

00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:16.430
of high index near the
center of this element.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:25.280
And we also went through this
other case of axial GRIN.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.300
And we also said that this is--

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.340
now that's interesting.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.300
If you only have z gradient,
then it is still not a lens.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.050
I'll let you think
about this by yourself.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.140
In order to make
it a lens, you have

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.848
to have an x gradient,
the index of refraction.

00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:44.390
So this case is
somewhere in between,

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.890
where you have a z gradient--
so the index is higher

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.680
in the front and
lower in the back--

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.720
but in order to get
optical power, that

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.530
is to get focusing power, in
this case you actually grind.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.990
In addition, you
grind it to a sphere.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.800
And we said that the reason
you do this axial GRIN here

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.750
is because you're
going to correct

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.400
for spherical aberration.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.400
So if you compare the paths
now of this ray to this ray,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.210
in this case, this ray goes
through a longer optical path,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.310
because the index is
uniformly high here.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.250
Therefore, it bends faster.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.950
In this case, by lowering
the index of refraction

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.910
that this ray goes,
you actually force

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.170
it to go to a longer
geometrical trajectory.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.380
Therefore, you're pushing
it further to the back.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.130
This is another way to interpret
the way this element corrects.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.080
You can interpret
it with Snell's law.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.920
This is what we did last time.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.400
But now, with our
newfound wisdom

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.210
on optical paths and Fermat, we
can also explain it this way.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.730
I lowered the optical
path by virtue

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.530
of lowering the index here.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.110
Therefore, the ray has
to go outwards in order

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:00.800
to increase its travel
distance, and still

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.910
maintain the same path
as the central ray.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:10.550
So the net effect is that you're
correcting the bad quality

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:15.410
focus here that was caused
by the spherical aberration.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.480
And I believe where we
left it last time is

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.920
we asked this
question, what if I

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.600
have an arbitrary
index of refraction

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.410
as a function of position?

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.300
What if this is not
quadratic, this is not axial,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.820
this is some general function
of r, the Cartesian coordinate?

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.540
What then?

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.660
What is the--

00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:45.780
I lost my train of thought.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.190
What is the path of the--

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.160
what is the
trajectory of the rays

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.270
that go through this
variable index medium.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.940
And I don't remember
how far I went here,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.580
but we basically
took a turn here,

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.950
and we started talking
about mechanics probably

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.170
to some of your surprise.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.670
Can you remind me,
how far did I go?

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.420
Did I actually finish
this example or not?

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.963
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think so.

00:32:10.963 --> 00:32:11.880
Yeah, we covered this.

00:32:13.817 --> 00:32:16.400
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So I don't
feel like going into it again,

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:22.260
anyway, because this is
sort of good, old physics

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.170
101 kind of thing.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:31.490
What might be a little bit
unfamiliar is this development

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.510
here, which some of you
may have seen, some of you

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.420
may not have seen.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.380
So this is really not
doing anything spectacular.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.680
This is a simple
mathematical manipulation.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.840
So we start with the
equation of motion

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.680
for the mechanical oscillator.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.340
So the equation of motion
for the mechanical--

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.890
I'm sorry not the
equation of motion,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.660
but the energy for the
mechanical oscillator.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.870
So the energy consists,
of course, of two terms.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:08.310
One of them is, if you
wish, the elastic energy,

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:13.890
the potential that is due to the
restoring force of the spring.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.450
And the other is
the kinetic energy.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:24.230
And v is the velocity,
so v is basically x dot,

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.925
the first time derivative
of the position.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.810
So this is one
thing that we know.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.270
This is the energy
of the system.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.420
And since in our model,
there is no dissipation,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.630
the energy must be conserved.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.770
I can also write an equation
of motion for this system.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:48.000
And since it is a simple
spring force kind of system,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.810
I expect my equation of
motion to be second order,

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.700
so there would be
something of this sort--

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.880
m x double dot plus kx equals
the force, the excitation.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.710
So let's say that
this system is free.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.100
There is no force.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.620
So if it is moving, it is moving
because of a prior excitation,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.659
which if I start
it [INAUDIBLE] it

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.230
will go on forever, because
there is no dissipation.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.913
There is no place
for the energy to go.

00:34:18.913 --> 00:34:21.080
If you get this thing moving,
it will go on forever.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.730
But now, there's no force.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.310
So basically, I can write
down the equation of motion

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.068
like this, as a
homogeneous equation.

00:34:29.068 --> 00:34:30.860
So there's is a trick
that those of you who

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.630
use Matlab to solve differential
equations are very familiar.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.350
And the trick is the following--

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.830
you break this higher order
differential equation.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.449
You break it down into as
many as you need first order

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.010
differential equations.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.679
Since this is a
second order equation,

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.602
you only need two
first order equations.

00:34:51.602 --> 00:34:53.060
And the way you do
it is basically,

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.550
you write down an equation
that looks kind of stupid.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:03.890
The equation says that x dot
equals v. This is one equation.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.100
And then the other equation
comes from this one--

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.270
since x dot equals v, it means
that x double dot equals v dot.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.708
This is the acceleration.

00:35:13.708 --> 00:35:15.500
So the second equation
now comes from this,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:25.230
that is, v dot equals minus
whatever k over m times x.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:34.500
Now, I can define the
vector x v. And what

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.400
this set of equations
here has done,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.330
it has actually connected the
first derivative of this vector

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.040
with the vector
itself via matrix.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.730
And here is the vector
in its first derivative.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.610
Here is the vector itself.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.230
And what I have to put here in
order to make this look correct

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.180
is I have to put
1 here, and then

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:02.130
minus k over m here, and
then 0s, and then I'm done.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.970
So again, if you
ever used Matlab

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.790
to solve an ordinary
differential equation,

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.990
you're familiar with this.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.800
Matlab actually forces you to
rewrite your equation this way.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.720
But it turns out that
this kind of method

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.740
actually preceded Matlab
by about a century,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:23.270
because this is a standard way
of writing the equation in--

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.820
actually, I believe it was
Poincare who actually first

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.620
came up with this.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:33.540
It's the standard way to derive
the dynamics of a system.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.280
And this is not--

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.290
I don't want to spend
too much time with this.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.980
But what this slide basically
points out to you is

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:48.120
the following-- that if you
take this expression here,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.648
which I will call the energy,
but now we'll call it--

00:36:51.648 --> 00:36:53.690
of course, you cannot see
it because it's hidden.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.150
Now you can see it.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.940
So this expression
is to call the energy

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.220
but to that I will
call it the Hamiltonian

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.680
and it will become
apparent in a second why,

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.190
but if you take this
expression, this is now

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.040
a function of the two dynamical
variables, the same two

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.850
variables that appeared in
this expression over here.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:18.827
They actually get into
this equation, x comma v.

00:37:18.827 --> 00:37:20.660
It's a bit of a funny
way to think about it,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:26.110
but certainly you see x
here and you see v here.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.970
And actually, I don't
like v very much,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.180
because if I keep
using v, I will not

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.410
come up with the correct
set of equations.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.140
I will replace v
with the momentum.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.470
So that's a minor cheating.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:44.770
Instead of v, I will
replace it with p.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.400
So p, the momentum,
is simply m times v.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.270
So I haven't cheated
in any major way.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:53.750
I just did the simple
multiplication.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:58.840
So if you replace p
here, then the equation

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.280
will look like this.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.140
Nothing changes here.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:08.500
This part will look like
1/2 p squared over m.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.610
Oh, sorry.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.110
OK.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.660
So nothing major here.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.030
The magic now-- it's
not really magic.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.700
There's a good
reason for it, but it

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.420
looks like magic is that if
I do the following, if I take

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.560
the two derivatives of this
expression with respect

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.180
to x and p--

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.940
so if I take dh dx
and if I take dh dp.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.147
Can you still see?

00:38:40.147 --> 00:38:40.730
What do I get?

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.540
If I get dh dx, what is that?

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.110
It is kx.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:54.550
And if I take dh dp,
I will get p over m.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:07.060
So if I look carefully
here, this is p over m.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.090
That's the velocity.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:20.500
And this is minus kp, isn't it?

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:29.570
Wait a minute-- of
course, I know why.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.560
I have v dot here.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.100
Instead of v dot, let me
write it in terms of p dot.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.040
If I do in terms of
p dot, I multiply

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.190
by m both sides of the
equation, I will get minus kx.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.260
I don't have to
do anything else.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.250
So what do I get?

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:50.060
I get that dh dp,
which equals p over m,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.550
is this term in this equation.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.870
And if I get dh dx,
which is kx, it's

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.280
actually this term
in this equation.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.700
So basically, by taking
the partial derivatives

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.580
of this expression,
the Hamiltonian,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.370
with respect to my two
dynamical variables'

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:11.840
position and momentum, I came
up with the equation of motion

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.350
decomposed in the
dynamical variables, Matlab

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.050
style, or actually
Poincare's probably

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.910
shifting in his grave--

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.270
Poincare style, in the way
[INAUDIBLE] dynamical systems.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.520
So this is really what I
say in the top of the slide.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.495
Of course, I say it in a
slightly more formal way.

00:40:32.495 --> 00:40:33.870
And then the rest
of what I do is

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.070
I simply solve this equation,
but I will not do it here.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.103
This is a simple
harmonic oscillator.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.770
The mechanical system,
as I said before,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.940
is a car that will
move forever, eternally

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.770
in a sinusoidal fashion.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.350
And it's kind of
interesting, I guess,

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:57.330
that the energy alternates
between 100% kinetic, which

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.810
happens when the
cart, the particle

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.910
moves through the rest
position, because then it

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.800
is the maximum velocity
and has no potential.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.950
It is the rest
position of the spring.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:11.010
And it converts to
completely elastic when

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.220
it goes to the edge of
the range of motion,

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.260
because over there,
it has to reverse.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.040
Therefore, it will go
velocity zero momentarily,

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.590
and the kinetic energy has
vanished at this point.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.480
It has become all potential.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.713
This is probably boring, because
this stuff is very well known.

00:41:27.713 --> 00:41:29.130
What I really want
to do is I want

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.250
to establish a connection
between this very nice, very

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:38.820
well-known mechanical
stuff with optics.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.830
So basically, what I will
do now is I will derive--

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:44.610
I will not really derive,
but I will show you

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:47.880
a set of Hamiltonian
equations that actually

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.720
describe ray trajectories.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.950
And what is really
spectacular is

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.580
that, as you
pointed out earlier,

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:01.000
they will turn out to have an
exact mechanical analogy if you

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.440
use a certain equation for
the index of refraction.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.880
So we'll get to that.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.650
So there's two ways to derive
the Hamiltonian equations.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.430
Does anybody know, in
the field of mechanics?

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.990
Does anybody know how we get
the Hamiltonian equations, what

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.480
is the process?

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.950
Well, I sort of just
described it over here,

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.100
but I guess what
I'm trying to get

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.800
to is, how did this come about?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.410
Of course, it came about
from my physical intuition,

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.470
because I know that
to have a kinetic--

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.710
someone told me 1,000 years ago
when I was a student in school

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.030
that this is the case.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.530
But--

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.510
AUDIENCE: It's the invariant
property of the system.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.173
It's the total energy
we put in at the start.

00:42:57.173 --> 00:42:58.590
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, so it is

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.640
the invariance of the system,
and also, mechanical systems,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.770
they also have a Fermat
principle of their own.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.580
If you recall,
mechanical systems

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.070
also try to minimize
their potential.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.950
The trajectory that
they follow tries

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.590
to minimize their potential.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:24.090
So a good example
of that is actually,

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.220
forgetting that this
is optics, imagine

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:31.290
that what you see here in this
sort of fancy-looking diagram,

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:36.370
this is not the index of
refraction, but this is a star.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.160
Imagine that the center of this
[INAUDIBLE] massive object,

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.030
a massive gravitational
attraction,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.730
like actually the sun.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.140
And imagine that it's
not a ray anymore,

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:57.572
but imagine that that trajectory
is the path of the satellite.

00:43:57.572 --> 00:43:58.780
This is convincing, isn't it?

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:06.010
If you allow the grayscale
to denote gravity now,

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.470
not index of refraction
but potential

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:14.980
due to the gravitational
field exerted by the planet,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:20.260
then if I launch a
spacecraft, or a satellite,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.790
or whatever in the vicinity
of this gravitational field,

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:32.950
as you know if you are a sort of
amateur astronomer or aspiring

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.460
astronaut-- if you
are, then you know

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.210
that depending on how you launch
your spacecraft, sometimes,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.770
it will actually sort of
circle once and then escape.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.030
That's very bad, because
it means that say,

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.950
if you're an astronaut,
you're going to space forever.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.200
But also you know that if
you launch it properly, then

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.420
you can actually get into orbit.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.140
And orbit means that
the dynamics here

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.420
is such that you will actually
start circling this object.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.098
In fact, we never launch
spacecraft to stars.

00:45:04.098 --> 00:45:06.390
Typically, we launch them to
planets nearby, but then--

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.970
So it turns out that
the trajectories

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.410
that these spacecraft
follow, actually

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.563
they also minimize their
"optical path," where there's

00:45:20.563 --> 00:45:21.730
no index of refraction then.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.050
It is just gravity.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.645
But they actually do follow the
minimum path around the star.

00:45:26.645 --> 00:45:29.020
And in fact, this has been
known for more than a century.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.290
I mean, Copernicus even
hinted at that in his work,

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:40.450
when he computed the
orbits of the planets

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.250
in the solar system.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.620
So these are very
well known stuff.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.982
So what I will do now, then,
is I will actually drive you,

00:45:47.982 --> 00:45:49.690
without really proving
anything, but that

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.360
will drive you to a set
of Hamiltonian equations

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.970
that describe the same
analogy, but for optics now.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.990
So in order to derive our
Hamiltonian equations,

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.412
we actually need two postulates.

00:46:02.412 --> 00:46:03.870
Now what does it
mean, "postulate?"

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.180
Do you know that word?

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.434
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:12.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
have a doubt regarding

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:13.920
definition of Hamiltonian.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.270
Why can't it be some
other invariant quantity

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.300
like angular momentum
or linear momentum,

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.853
and energy in this case?

00:46:23.853 --> 00:46:25.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
you're actually there.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:30.270
You're forcing me to say
what I didn't say before.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.300
How did this come about?

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.970
This comes about-- and
I have to apologize now,

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:40.080
because I will throw a
lot of jargon at you.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.900
This comes about from
something called the Lagrangian

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.030
principle.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:46.830
So the Lagrangian
is very-- actually,

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.833
if you write the Lagrangian, it
looks very similar to this one.

00:46:51.833 --> 00:46:52.750
Looks similar to this.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.490
The question you're asking
the mechanical system

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.487
is, what is the trajectory
that the system will follow?

00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:02.320
So we have a particle
or a set of particles,

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.170
and you ask what
is the trajectory.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.080
There Lagrangian actually
looks very similar to this,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.130
but with a minus sign.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.850
And I never quite remember
if you put the minus

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:24.960
sign here or here, but anyway,
one of those has a minus sign.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.510
And so what you do then
is you put this Lagrangian

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.360
into this integral.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.030
And you say that the trajectory
that the particle will

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.640
follow actually
minimizes this integral.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.710
Now, this has a very good
physical justification,

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.660
because this is
actually Newton's Law.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.670
The way you get this
Lagrangian is you

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.250
start with good, old
Newton, which says that--

00:47:57.265 --> 00:47:58.015
Then you multiply.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.190
I haven't cheated.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.620
I've multiplied
it with a quantity

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.250
that is hopefully non-zero.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.300
And then you can write
it down as 1 and--

00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:32.810
actually not quite 0
any more, but constant.

00:48:38.672 --> 00:48:40.380
Now confuse my mind
with science somehow.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.052
Well, anyway.

00:48:51.052 --> 00:49:02.213
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:03.880
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's a good plan,

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.035
because this is a
restoring force.

00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:14.180
But anyway, how do we actually
derive the Hamiltonian?

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.030
So I don't know
what has happened,

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.790
but if you think about it,
this is now the Hamiltonian,

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.490
isn't it?

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.807
So by a simple trick on
Newton's Law, it derive--

00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:25.390
that's not quite
what I was expecting,

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:26.608
but it happened anyway.

00:49:26.608 --> 00:49:28.150
The answer to the
question is simpler

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.190
than I was expecting it to be.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:34.320
So there is the Hamiltonian.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.125
now why that and why
not the momentum?

00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:39.375
That really has to do with
the Lagrangian, but let's--

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.460
It's clear what I
did here, right?

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.130
This is just a simple
manipulation that I learned

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.408
from Professor [? Jerry ?]
[? Wickham ?] at Caltech,

00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:54.908
actually.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:12.530
I think I skipped a slide.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.980
Here we go.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.920
So we were at this
word, "postulate."

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.840
What does "postulate" mean?

00:50:27.645 --> 00:50:29.270
AUDIENCE: We accept
something without--

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.083
we say something and
we accept something.

00:50:34.083 --> 00:50:35.750
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right, yeah.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.030
So the postulate is a good way
to develop a scientific theory

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.760
in the following sense--

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.740
first of all, postulates
cannot be very complicated.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:48.510
So it is something simple that
we accept with two caveats--

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.590
one is that we
accept it because it

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.660
has justified the observation.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.270
So postulate had better be
something that has never

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.410
been violated to our knowledge.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.160
For example, the
sun rises every day.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.740
As far as humanity
has recorded history,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.930
this has happened every
day, except, of course,

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.470
in the north above the arctic,
where some days the sun

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.130
does not rise.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.300
So that's one.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.070
And the second is
that the theory

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:19.640
that follows from the postulate
has to be self consistent.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.370
So it has to be
mathematically consistent.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.760
So typically the postulates are
things that I don't quite feel

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.630
like proving, but
they're good assumptions,

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.880
like assumptions that cannot
be very easily challenged.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.480
So the assumptions
here, one of them

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.590
is that rays are continuous.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.750
That really cannot be
very easily challenged,

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:48.230
because if a ray were to jump,
that would be really strange.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.680
And I can quote a number
of physical reasons

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.570
why this would be
really strange.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.410
For one is that relativity--

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:01.360
it means that somehow, a photon,
if we believe that photons

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.190
follow the ray
trajectories, it means

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:09.880
that somehow light within
zero time, actually

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.680
traverses a finite distance.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.400
That is impossible, so
that is one good reason.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:20.720
So if you accept, then, that
the rays must be continuous,

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.650
actually, it is only continuity.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.830
I am not saying that the
rays are differentiable.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.120
So the rays can bend like this.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.280
So here, actually, obviously,
it is non-differentiable,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.900
but it's still continuous.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.510
So the postulate actually
talks about continuity,

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.870
not differentiability.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.970
Piece-wise
differentiable, yes, it

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.770
is, because it is certainly
piece-wise differentiable here,

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.330
piece-wise differentiable there.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.370
This is actually a technicality.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:51.240
Functions that are not
piece-wise differentiable

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.240
are really nasty beasts, like
Weierstrass functions and stuff

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.300
like that, which normally we
don't deal with in engineering.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.960
So basically, the
second condition here

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.980
is a mathematical technicality.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.400
So we don't have
to dwell on that.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:11.430
Now here's something that
probably as engineers, we've

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:15.300
got turned off by when we
learned it in calculus.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.660
But it's actually a useful thing
that is called the "mean value

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.190
theorem."

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:22.150
And the mean value theorem
says the following--

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:26.920
says that if you are given
a continuous piece-wise

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.080
differentiable function--

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:30.910
so here it is--

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:37.340
so this is x.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.840
This is f of--

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.230
so this curve here is f of x.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:53.710
This is some function of
x1, x2, f of x1, f of x2.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.590
The mean value theorem
says that according

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:01.570
to the conditions I just stated,
there is a point somewhere

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:05.020
in this interval satisfying
the following property,

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:17.240
that f of x2 minus x1 over x2
minus x1 equals f prime of x.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:23.000
So basically, this ratio,
I can pick a point xi

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.690
somewhere in this interval
such that the value

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.240
of the derivative of a
function at this point

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.770
equals this ratio.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.570
And of course, you can
realize immediately

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.025
that if you make the interval
very, very tiny, then

00:54:36.025 --> 00:54:38.150
of course, you get the
definition of the derivative

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.930
itself.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:42.440
But the mean value theorem
is a little bit more general.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.980
And it is the mean value
theorem that I use here in order

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.540
to write this equation.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.970
This is basically the
mean value theorem,

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:54.980
where the quantity of
interest that I applied

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.593
is the ray trajectory.

00:54:57.593 --> 00:54:58.760
Let me back up for a second.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.510
I should have started
with something else.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.400
What am I really plotting here?

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.420
So the red curve is
the ray trajectory.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:09.620
So I describe the ray
trajectory as a vector, Q.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.690
So the vector is
a position vector.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.990
This is the origin
of the coordinates

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:16.830
and Q is the position vector.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:19.610
And then I parameterize
it with a variable s.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.080
So basically, s is an index.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.900
As I increase, as
I step through s,

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.310
I basically walk
along this trajectory.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.830
So you can think of
s as time, as time

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.960
goes forward, the light
particles, if you wish,

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.810
are moving along this curve.

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:42.650
And at each point on the
curve, since it is continuous

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.010
and piece-wise differentiable,
at each point I can define

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.410
a tangent--

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.480
except, of course,
the point where

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.570
it is not differentiable, but
let's skip those for a moment.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.070
In the point that
is differentiable,

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:55.570
we can define a tangent.

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:58.630
And this tangent
is the vector P.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:05.230
So this vector P is actually
the momentum of the ray.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:10.900
So since the tangent is
associated with a derivative--

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.940
in fact, in
high-dimensional space,

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.090
it is even more obvious because
the tangent really points

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.070
towards the--

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.670
it is the tangent.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.570
Then this really
is an expression

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.230
of the mean value theorem for
the continuous and piece-wise

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.580
differentiable ray.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.930
And of course, I can write it
down as a differential equation

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.080
by taking the limit.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:42.270
And there is one element
that is sort of missing here.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:43.620
That's the normalization.

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:48.148
Why did I pick to normalize
by the value of the tangent?

00:56:48.148 --> 00:56:49.440
Let's leave that alone for now.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.110
Let's assume that it
is correct, and see

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:55.590
if it will lead us to an
acceptable physical result.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:59.250
So what I'm trying to say
is that the denominator here

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.000
is arbitrary.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.110
I don't really need it.

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:02.480
I can throw it out.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.880
It is a normalization
parameter, and I put it there

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.570
because with hindsight,
it would lead me

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:14.370
to a physically
acceptable result.

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:17.130
The second postulate
is a little bit easier

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:20.070
to swallow, thanks to
[? Kalpesh's ?] question,

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.550
because the second
postulate says that the ray,

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:27.520
very similar to a spacecraft
approaching a planet,

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.650
a ray actually is attracted
by a high index of refraction.

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:34.860
And the way we quantify
this assumption is we

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:39.060
say that if the ray
enters a region where

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.400
the index of
refraction is variable,

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.770
that this has a gradient.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.980
So that's the gradient, in
case you have forgotten--

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:47.880
I hope not.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.490
So if there's a gradient
in index of refraction,

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:52.590
the ray will receive a kick.

00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:55.140
And the kick of the ray--

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.220
what the kick really means is
that its momentum will change.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.590
Therefore, the
trajectory will bend

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:05.250
and the kick that is
a change in momentum

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.560
will be proportional
to the gradient.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.970
That is the postulate.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:12.800
And I will not do it
here, but if you--

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.800
it is a little bit of a long
derivation, I have to warn you.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.240
I went through it
and I decided--

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.740
actually, I went
through it and then

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.540
I decided not to
put it in the notes,

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.670
because it is a
little bit involved.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:29.560
But this actually turns out to
be equivalent to Snell's Law.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.450
So if you want, I can give
you a copy of my notes

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:36.700
where I derived it,
but if you don't

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.000
feel like going through
two pages of calculus

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.080
of variations, then please
take my word for it.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.770
This is actually Snell's Law,
but written in a funny way.

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:56.650
So that's, then, the sort
of variational version.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:58.870
And we can write it down
as a differential equation,

00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.650
and we get this.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.810
So now, we're kind
of going backwards.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:08.940
Now, we have two
differential equations.

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.650
Yes.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:11.770
AUDIENCE: Why the
position variables

00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:16.700
are different on both
sides, s and s dash?

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.450
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
You mean the s prime?

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:19.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, s prime.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:20.850
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh, the s prime

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:24.252
is actually the xi from
the mean value theorem.

00:59:24.252 --> 00:59:24.960
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.543
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
When you write it

00:59:26.543 --> 00:59:29.702
in the variational form, s prime
can you be anywhere in here.

00:59:29.702 --> 00:59:30.660
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.050
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I don't
know exactly where it is.

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:33.780
And very similar to
here, actually again here

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.980
I invoke the mean value theorem.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.920
I didn't say that then.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.780
Yeah.

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.170
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
But of course,

00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:38.587
when you do the
differential form,

00:59:38.587 --> 00:59:40.650
it vanishes, because
the interval collapses.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.560
So now what I have is actually
two differential equations.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.960
One of them contains
a trajectory,

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.000
the other contains a momentum.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.740
So this is basically the
two-dimensional analog

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.920
to the dynamical system
that I wrote here.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.340
I have an equation
for the position.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.413
This is it.

01:00:07.413 --> 01:00:09.580
And I have a differential
equation for the momentum.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.390
This is it.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:12.620
This is the equation
for the position.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.380
This is the equation
for the momentum.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.740
I used q for the position here,
because that's a convention

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.330
in geometrical optics.

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:23.670
People use q, not x, but
q is the position vector.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.730
Well, that's fine.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:32.310
The question is,
is there anything

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:33.450
that is conserved here?

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:39.900
Did I derive any
sort of Hamiltonian?

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.140
It turns out-- and again, this
requires a bit of hindsight,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:51.410
but I can pick the Hamiltonian
to be of this form,

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:55.820
to be equal to the
magnitude of the momentum

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.280
minus the index of refraction.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.130
Let's write down the
two equations again.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.340
So this is the equations.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.100
And the Hamiltonian
that I picked

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:13.880
is H equals p minus n of q.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.030
You can see now that
if I do the gradient--

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.450
now in the high-dimensional
case, instead of

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.000
the derivatives of
the Hamiltonian,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.900
I have to take the gradient.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.760
So if I do the gradient of the
Hamiltonian with respect to--

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:40.958
let's do the first
one-- with respect to q,

01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:42.500
this is really what
I'm going to get.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.875
And if I do the Hamiltonian
with respect to p--

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.405
what is p?

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:09.160
So for example,
if you do dH dp x,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.830
you will get p x
over the square root.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:23.930
And then you can follow
dH dp y and so on.

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:30.305
So therefore, the gradient,
which is defined as a vector--

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.400
So you can basically see
from this simple derivation

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:17.180
here that by this choice of a
Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.960
that I wrote here, I can
actually derive consistently

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.260
the set of
Hamiltonian equations.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.200
So I basically
find that the dq ds

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.800
equals the derivative or the
gradient of the Hamiltonian

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.920
with respect to the conjugate
variable, the momentum,

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.800
and the other way
around for dp ds.

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:43.720
So this equation, then,
is the Hamiltonian.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.670
It is not the only
one, by the way.

01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:47.140
Hamiltonians,
they're not unique.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.830
Clearly for example, I can add
an arbitrary constant here.

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.400
I can get another Hamiltonian.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.400
And we know that
for energy also.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.440
Energy is not unique.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.172
I can add constants to it, and
it is still remains energy.

01:04:00.172 --> 01:04:01.630
So you need the
reference basically

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.370
to decide which way to go.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.836
But anyway, this is one
possible Hamiltonian.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.100
How do we explain it physically?

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.440
Well, the momentum is a vector.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.790
And what the Hamiltonian
says, that the difference

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.900
between the magnitude
of the vector

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.570
at the given position of
the index of refraction,

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.670
the difference has
to be constant.

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:32.130
I can pick this
constant to be 0.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:34.560
Since it is arbitrary,
let me pick it to be 0.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.350
If that is the case,
what I'm really saying

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:41.640
is that the momentum, the
vector of the momentum

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.890
is constrained to
lie on a sphere.

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:48.770
And that actually is known
as Descartes' sphere,

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.580
but it is not really--

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.820
Descartes was not the first
one to make this observation.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:56.770
It was an Arab scientist
whose name is, I believe,

01:04:56.770 --> 01:05:00.770
al-Haytham, who actually
made this observation

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:02.150
for the first time.

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:05.150
And actually, al-Haytham
also derived Snell's Law

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:07.950
for the first time.

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:11.430
So basically what the
Hamiltonian that we derived

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:15.120
says is that the
momentum of the array

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.270
is constrained to
lie on a sphere.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.820
Now I did not go through the
slides when we did Snell's law,

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.970
but it is in your notes.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.550
And you may have noticed it
if you were diligent when

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.860
you were studying the notes.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.620
Because I actually showed--

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.420
this slide is another way
to derive Descartes' Law.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.340
So what is happening here is
I have the familiar situation

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.620
of Snell's Law.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:53.620
I have a medium of
index n to the left

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.810
and the medium of index
n prime to the right.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:02.720
And in each medium, I associate
a sphere with a radius

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.090
equal to what
Descartes predicts.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:09.410
So the sphere has radius n on
the left and another sphere

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:11.870
with radius n
prime on the right.

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:13.720
In this case, n prime
is bigger than n,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.470
so the sphere is bigger
on the right-hand side.

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:22.290
So Snell's Law here is
derived by applied momentum

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:25.680
observation, which actually,
Professor Sheppard mentioned

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.590
in the beginning when
we were discussing

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:29.340
[? Kalpesh's ?] question.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.610
And momentum observation
says the following--

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:45.450
that in the vertical direction,
up and down, clearly,

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:48.100
this geometry is invariant.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.350
There's no change.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.990
So therefore, the momentum
must be conserved.

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:55.610
The momentum on
the left-hand side,

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:59.570
which we denote as p
vertical, and the momentum

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:03.290
on the right-hand side, p
prime vertical, must be equal.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:10.350
And since the momenta controls
Descartes' calculation

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:14.080
equal to this, then basically,
these vertical components

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.700
are obtained by projecting
the radius of the sphere

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.583
onto the vertical axis.

01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:21.000
And of course, if
you do this now,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.310
you immediately get Snell's Law,
because this angle is theta.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:30.510
So therefore, this length
equals n sine theta

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:33.960
on the left-hand side,
and n prime sine theta

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.030
prime on the right-hand side.

01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:40.240
So that is yet another
way to obtain Snell's Law.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.950
And of course, you
might wonder what

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.130
happens to the momentum
on the [? back, ?]

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.200
on the longitudinal dimension.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:47.920
That's OK.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.300
You can have a
change in momentum

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.560
there because there
is a change in media.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.290
So the change in media
actually corresponds

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:58.030
to a change in momentum.

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.520
And momentum is
conserved, with actually

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.170
means that the medium
here, if you actually

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.800
use the proper electrodynamics,
there is actually

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.050
a force applied in
this medium here

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:11.050
due to the change in
momentum of the light.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:13.370
But this is beyond the
scope of the class,

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:17.760
so we'll not discuss it
in any greater detail.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.319
So this kind of picture here,
with the Descartes sphere,

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:25.020
it also applies
to a GRIN medium.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.430
So here is a medium whose index
of refraction is variable.

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.630
So you go from low to high.

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:34.790
Again, the convention is
gray means higher index.

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:35.960
And you can break it down.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.390
Like we did, again, in the
beginning of the class,

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.710
we can break it down into slices
of progressively higher index.

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:46.510
And you can apply
Snell's Law, using

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:52.279
either Snell itself or the
succession of Descartes sphere.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:55.020
You can apply it as
the ray goes down.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.160
And then either because
it has too much momentum

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.970
or because it has to
satisfy Snell's Law,

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.939
these two statements
are exactly equivalent,

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:07.529
the ray must bend its path.

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:13.979
So this is yet another way to
justify why the ray is bending.

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:16.529
It is bending because
it must conserve

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:18.420
the value of this Hamiltonian.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.550
It must lie on the
Descartes sphere.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.040
But of course, in
the GRIN medium,

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.750
we have to be a
little bit careful

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:27.569
because this sphere
has a variable radius,

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:29.580
as you can see in this
diagram over here.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.510
Now let's come to the other
question that was asked.

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:42.407
Is there an analogy between
mechanics and optics?

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:44.240
And because we're running
a little bit late,

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.729
I don't want to spend too
long with this analogy.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:47.990
It's a very interesting one.

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.250
I'll let you study it.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:55.690
And if you'd like, we can
also discuss it later.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.800
But basically, the
analogy comes from this--

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.290
we go back and rewrite
the Hamiltonian equation

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:05.200
of the mechanical
system as a sort

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.230
of unassailable
kinetic energy term.

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:09.725
The first term over
here is clearly

01:10:09.725 --> 01:10:11.350
the kinetic energy,
the term that looks

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.510
like momentum squared over 2m.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:18.130
Then the potential-- we
wrote the potential before.

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:19.900
In the case of the
elastic spring,

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:28.060
the elastic potential was v of
q equals 1/2 k q [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.020
That's one special case
of a restoring force,

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.700
of an elastic potential.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.330
But it could be more general.

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:40.020
So we write it as v of q.

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.790
And then the rest
of the definitions

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:45.680
are basically straightforward.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.170
The momentum equals m
times the time derivative

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:52.020
of the trajectory.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.430
Anyway, like I
said, I don't want

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.070
to go through this
in great detail.

01:10:56.070 --> 01:11:00.810
But basically, if
as a starting force

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:05.280
we use the index of
refraction squared divided

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.610
by 2m, where m is
like a fictitious mass

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:10.380
that we have to
assign to the photon,

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.290
then we would basically
get the one-to-one analogy.

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:15.360
This is quite interesting,
because it is really

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.810
acting like a spring
or like gravity,

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:20.760
but gravity is not
exactly the same,

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.500
because gravity
is like 1 over r.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.000
So you have to make
an approximation

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.890
and blah, blah, blah.

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:29.370
But if you think
of it as a spring,

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.080
then you get basically
a one-to-one analogy.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.426
So it's kind of interesting.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.030
And the last thing
I want to say,

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:42.900
because it has a
practical significance,

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:49.950
is that once we write down
the Hamiltonian equations,

01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.120
then it is very convenient.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.370
In addition to all this
nice physics, and intuition,

01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:56.070
and so on, it is
very convenient,

01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:00.270
because we can just plug them
in Matlab and solve them.

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:03.420
So if someone is giving
us a graded index medium--

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:10.260
now whether it is quadratic,
or cubic, or whatever,

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:14.780
27th polynomial, or
anything for that matter,

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:20.130
we can just solve it using
this set of equations.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:24.600
And here, what I did is I did
an example of a quadratic index

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.973
medium on-axis, off-axis.

01:12:26.973 --> 01:12:28.890
You can see that on-axis
actually pretty good.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:31.020
It is not completely
free of spherical,

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.850
but pretty close to free.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.700
You can see it does come to a
very nice geometrical focus.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.032
Of course, off-axis, it
has a terrible aberration

01:12:39.032 --> 01:12:39.990
that we've called what?

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.840
How do we call this particular
aberration that we see here?

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.500
AUDIENCE: Coma.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.583
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Coma.

01:12:51.374 --> 01:12:51.874
Yes.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.050
AUDIENCE: Can you use
the index of refraction

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.690
to correct for coma?

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:05.470
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, of course.

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:08.890
In fact, believe it or not,
this is a research project

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:12.520
in my group, which
says that suppose

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.820
you wanted to define
an arbitrary index

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.640
distribution here
in order to correct

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.817
for a given set of aberrations.

01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:22.650
So someone is giving
you the specifications.

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.640
They say, I want to
eliminate the coma

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.080
for this angle of incidence.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.060
I want to eliminate other
aberrations, for example

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.320
astigmatism and so on,
then in principle, you

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.190
can come up with some
index of refraction,

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:39.670
n of r, which if
properly chosen,

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:44.090
will eliminate this
specified aberration.

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:45.965
Now of course, that's
pretty easy, actually.

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:47.090
That doesn't need research.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.050
It's kind of like a
computational problem.

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:54.400
But how do you implement an
arbitrary index of refraction?

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.200
That's difficult.
So we're actually

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.240
working on that in my group.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.290
But yeah, in principle, you can.

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:02.862
In practice, with
commercial GRINs,

01:14:02.862 --> 01:14:04.070
it a bit difficult, actually.

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:07.360
You would probably have to use
something more than a GRIN,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.150
as far as I know.

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:11.540
Yeah.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:15.200
AUDIENCE: On the previous
slide, you said n has to be--

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:15.700
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.492
AUDIENCE: Can you press
the button, please?

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.590
Can you press the button?

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:28.600
AUDIENCE: He is pressing,
but it's broken.

01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:36.710
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:38.270
AUDIENCE: On the
previous slide, you

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:41.604
said something about physical--

01:14:41.604 --> 01:14:45.580
n has to be greater than 0.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.420
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
You caught me.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:48.920
Yes.

01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:03.305
Yes, I said that n has
to be bigger than 1,

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:04.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.110
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Better than 1.

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:10.880
The question is, can n be
less than 1 and less than 0?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.320
From the point of view
of geometrical optics,

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.570
n is the speed of
light in a bulk medium.

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:29.110
And in ordinary bulk media that
we use in geometrical optics,

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.210
light is always
slower than in vacuum,

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.700
so n is always bigger than 1.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.480
In a few lectures, when we do
proper electromagnetics-- also,

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.470
let me say that
so far, n has been

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:41.980
a phenomenological quantity.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.870
That's another funny
word like "postulate."

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.530
What does it mean,
"phenomenological."

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:49.390
It means a quantity
that I have not

01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.330
justified its physical origin.

01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:52.950
I just pulled it out of a hat.

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:58.180
And I said, hey, you know
what, the speed of light

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.580
in the medium is less than
the speed in a vacuum.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.080
So therefore, it
is bigger than 1.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.690
Now, when we do the proper
physical origins of n,

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.360
then we will see that
indeed, n can be less than 1.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.970
It can even be negative,
and that's another hot topic

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:15.310
in research optics nowadays.

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.390
So it is not necessary.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.440
That's true.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.350
But if you take it into
the mechanical analogy,

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:22.540
interestingly
enough, if you allow

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:28.330
n to go into these sort of
strange modern sort of regions,

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:33.240
where it is less than 1
and even negative, then

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.990
in the mechanical
analogy you would end up

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.008
with a negative energy,
which is kind of interesting.

01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:39.050
It doesn't mean anything.

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:40.050
This is just an analogy.

01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:44.200
It doesn't invalidate anything,
but it is kind of interesting.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:50.810
And let me say upfront,
n becoming smaller than 1

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:53.570
does not mean that I
violate relativity.

01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:56.900
It does not mean that
something moves faster

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.210
than the speed of light.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.610
And as we will see,
just today, actually, n

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:04.710
is what we call the
"phase velocity."

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:07.160
And the phase velocity of
wave can be much greater

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.010
than the speed of
light, because the phase

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.880
carries no information.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.210
That's sort of the
classical way to justify it.

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:17.990
So I can allow, actually,
n to be less than 1,

01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.740
and am perfectly fine.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:24.060
So it is not necessary, but
I should put a qualification

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:24.560
here.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.700
Not physically allowable,
but how you say--

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:34.960
every day intuition
allowable, perhaps.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.360
But of course, physicists
can do much better

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.903
than everyday intuition.

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:48.360
So let's resume for
another 20 minutes or so,

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.490
and we'll continue on Monday.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.390
So what I would like
to do today is start

01:17:56.390 --> 01:18:00.440
the description of wave optics.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:06.780
So basically, we followed
geometrical optics

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.870
and it was good
enough to explain

01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:13.920
a number of interesting things
for us, imaging systems,

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.860
gradient indices, and so on.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.640
But geometrical optics also
has some serious failures.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.030
The most important
of those is that when

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:27.980
light interacts with
very small features,

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.170
geometrical optics fails.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:31.980
So for example, I used
it when I answered

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.450
[? Kalpesh's ?] question.

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:37.370
If you limit light to
a single ray-- that

01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:40.920
is to an infinitesimal, small
spot-- than geometrical optics

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.250
pattern fails.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:45.485
So the picture that it gives
us are completely wrong.

01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:46.860
So in order to
deal with that, we

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.650
have to deal with light
as a wave phenomenon.

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.920
And there's an
interesting history there.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.270
Newton was a big proponent
of geometrical or particle

01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.450
description of light.

01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:00.510
Some other
contemporaries of his,

01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:05.660
like Huygens, Fresnel, and
sort of the Continental school,

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.470
they were proponents
of the wave theory.

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:13.650
And for many years,
the question remained

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:17.270
unsettled until Maxwell--

01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:21.920
in the end, I think 1899, or
1896, or something like that,

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.150
James Clerk Maxwell, actually
a Professor of Fluid Mechanics,

01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:29.390
came up with a set of equations
that proved very convincingly

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.900
that the light is a wave.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.600
And then 10 years
later, quantum mechanics

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.880
proved that light
is also a particle.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.870
So both were correct.

01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:43.340
Both Newton and the Continental
school were correct.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:47.030
So anyway, so you can think now
that we're basically now moving

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:49.550
from England to the
continental Europe,

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.850
because we're abandoning the
geometrical optics theory,

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:55.860
and we're moving to wave optics.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:05.000
Now, waves, of course, are
a very pervasive phenomenon

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.550
that we see around us.

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:12.540
And they manifest themselves
in many different forms.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:19.730
So we're familiar with waves in
seawater or rivers, and so on.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.190
We're familiar with sound waves.

01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:23.510
It's actually
Singapore's founder,

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:25.760
Lee Kuan Yew giving a speech.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.350
So we can communicate
by sound waves.

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:30.890
That's another form
of a material wave.

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:33.630
So like water waves, sound
waves are material waves.

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:38.990
You set the air particles
in motion when you speak.

01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:43.430
We're also familiar with
electromagnetic or radio waves,

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:44.930
not because we can see them.

01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:47.960
These are actually not
something that you can touch.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.580
But all of us, we use cell
phones, old-fashioned radios,

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:53.610
and so on.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.210
We use them.

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:56.260
This is actually an
old-fashioned antenna.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.280
It's not that old-fashioned if
you go to places like Europe,

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.710
like Greece, for example.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.980
Many homes still have those
antennas in their roof.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.460
So this is the way people used
to receive television signals

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.400
before cable TV.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.665
And finally, there's other waves
that they're sort of not quite

01:21:12.665 --> 01:21:13.790
obvious that they're waves.

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:17.490
This is a very interesting
geological phenomenon

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:18.450
in the Philippines.

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.270
It's called the
"Chocolate Hills."

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:25.400
There's a number, it's actually
hundreds of very small hills,

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.510
not very tall.

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.700
You might say, what
kind of a wave is that?

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.050
The hills are not moving.

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.150
Actually, they're not
moving in our time scale,

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:38.250
but in the geological
terms, they actually move.

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:39.780
And sometimes, this motion--

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:43.260
as you know, the
motion of the earth--

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.990
it can actually
happen in timescales

01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:49.022
that are perceived by
humans, and then it's

01:21:49.022 --> 01:21:49.980
called an "earthquake."

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.900
It's a very nasty phenomenon.

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.310
So the point is here that
waves manifest themselves

01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:58.170
in many different forms.

01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:02.040
Of course, I omitted another
important manifestation,

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.510
which is quantum mechanics.

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:06.480
Quantum mechanics says that
everything is actually wave,

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.700
including yourselves and me.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.830
And every particle is
also described as a wave.

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.920
So electrons can be thought
of as waves, and so on, and so

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.420
forth.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:23.330
Anyway, the waves are in fact
so pervasive that there's

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:25.250
no proper definition.

01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:30.750
And to paraphrase something that
an artist said once about art,

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:34.430
he said that art
cannot be defined,

01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:37.610
but you know it when you see it.

01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:39.870
That's actually a very
good way to put it,

01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:41.970
at least as far as
art is concerned.

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:44.430
But it's also true about waves.

01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:47.310
Because there is
a great variation

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:53.790
in the way waves occur,
there's no proper definition.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:57.060
What I attempted here is
the simplest possible,

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:01.080
all-inclusive definition
as a traveling disturbance.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.630
As far as I can
tell, it is certainly

01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.850
inclusive of all waves.

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:07.470
Of course, it
includes other things

01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:10.320
that may not be waves, like
a car moving down the road

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.000
is also a traveling disturbance.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.680
It is clearly not a wave.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:20.250
But anyway, another way
to perhaps describe waves

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.330
is if you--

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.170
there's some evidences
of wave behavior.

01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:28.198
And a very prominent one is
what you call "interference."

01:23:28.198 --> 01:23:29.990
So what you're seeing
here is, we will see,

01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:32.160
these are called
"spherical waves."

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.650
And we see two
point sources that

01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:36.480
meet in these spherical waves.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.640
And as they propagate
out, you see

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.810
this very characteristic
alternation

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:45.600
between bright and dark spots.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.090
I have not even really
said what this thing is.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:52.180
Is it a sound wave, a water
wave, an electromagnetic wave?

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.240
In fact, it could
be all of the above.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.990
In all of these
cases, if I represent

01:23:57.990 --> 01:24:01.320
as bright the high
value of the disturbance

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.530
and as black the low
value of the disturbance,

01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:08.100
then these sort of
not quite periodic,

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.860
but periodic-like
looking behavior

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.280
is called "interference."

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.970
And when you observe this
sort of interference,

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:20.790
then it is a pretty
good indication

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:23.380
that you are actually
observing a wave phenomenon.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:26.820
In fact, the reason Fresnel
in the Continental school

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.730
insisted that light is a
wave is because they actually

01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:32.760
observed light interference
in experiments.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.400
They observed the
light doing something

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.850
like that in the experiment.

01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:38.990
So they said, well, wait,
it must be a wave, then.

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:44.550
Another phenomenon which is--

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:47.040
actually, it is related
to interference.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.500
When we cover it, it has
quite a different name.

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.030
It's called "diffraction."

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:53.640
But when we cover it, we
will see that clearly, it

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.200
is not a new phenomenon.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.560
It is interference
in this guise.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.840
And diffraction basically says
that the geometrical definition

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.290
of shadows is incorrect.

01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:11.820
So what you see here is a wave
that is impinging on a block.

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.890
So it is blocked
above and below.

01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:17.160
And a small portion of it
is allowed to pass through.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.900
Geometrical optics
would have you

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.500
believe that you
would basically get

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.200
a continuation,
unperturbed continuation

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.312
of the wave in the geometrical
shadow of this slit.

01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:30.770
You can think of
it as a slit there

01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:32.650
that the wave goes through.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:34.620
But diffraction says
that's not the case.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:38.370
As you can see, there's a
rather more complicated pattern

01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:41.820
that emerges here.

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.710
And that is another evidence
of a wave phenomenon

01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:51.730
that we will describe
quantitatively in great detail

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:52.230
later.

01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:59.920
Let's take a look a little
bit in some more waves.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.770
So for example, the first one--

01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:05.770
it meets my definition as
a traveling disturbance,

01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:09.190
but not a very interesting
one, because it is just a shape

01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:10.640
moving.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.750
The one that is on the right
is perhaps more interesting,

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.860
because now you see sort of--

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.890
it is more believable
that it is a wave.

01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:22.810
It has some oscillation in
addition to the traveling

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:23.650
disturbance.

01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:26.530
By the way, oscillatory
behavior is also

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:29.500
characteristic of waves.

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.300
But it is not
necessarily periodic.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.237
In fact, you can
have a periodic wave,

01:26:33.237 --> 01:26:34.570
but that's not very interesting.

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:36.850
It is the non-periodic
waves that

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:38.140
are the most interesting ones.

01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:47.628
Now, if you let me go back and
play this movie once again,

01:26:47.628 --> 01:26:49.920
that's not very interesting,
but what you will see here

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.337
is you will see
that it's actually

01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:55.110
the same envelope that you
saw moving on this diagram.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.810
You will see it is the same
envelope moving over here,

01:26:57.810 --> 01:27:00.780
but inside, you have some
wiggles that are also moving.

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:03.610
And if you observe
it very carefully,

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:05.680
you'll see that the
envelope is moving

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.150
with a different velocity
than the wiggles.

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:10.650
The wiggles have a
name, by the way.

01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:11.608
They're called fringes.

01:27:11.608 --> 01:27:12.520
Can you see?

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.880
So the wiggles are
actually moving faster

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.440
than the envelope.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.180
So this brings us
to the definition

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:23.050
of what I used once Professor
Sheppard's question about n

01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:23.970
earlier.

01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:26.560
I used the term
"phase velocity."

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.710
So what you saw in
the previous movie,

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:32.250
in the one that was in
the right-hand side,

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:35.160
was an envelope that was moving.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.220
So here is the blue one.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.410
That's the envelope.

01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:40.600
And inside, there
was a sinusoid.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.880
The sinusoid is multiplied
by the envelope.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.620
A wave that is composed
of a sinusoid multiplied

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:50.960
by an envelope is said
to have a carrier.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.720
So the carrier is
a sinusoid itself.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:04.610
The carrier can move at its own
velocity, which, surprisingly,

01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:08.300
is usually different
than the velocity

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.170
that the envelope is moving.

01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:13.730
Why I say surprisingly, well,
some simple sort of [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:16.380
might have said, they better
move at the same velocity,

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.130
shouldn't they, when in fact,
the truth is the opposite.

01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:20.890
More often than not--

01:28:20.890 --> 01:28:23.080
in fact, you have to try
very hard to make them move

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080
with the same velocity,
but more often than not,

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.710
they move at
different velocities.

01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:28.730
So the velocity at which
the envelope is moving

01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:30.770
is called the "group velocity."

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:32.840
The velocity at which
the carrier is moving

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.550
is called the "phase velocity."

01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:38.000
And right now, we'll just
leave those like this.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.030
Later, we will actually
derive them properly.

01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:43.450
And we will see how
they come about,

01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:45.950
and how they are defined.

01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:49.310
But I can say for now,
without any proof,

01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:58.210
that what we wrote in
geometrical optics, c over n,

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:00.490
that is the phase
velocity of the light.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.590
If you were to put an
envelope on the light somehow,

01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:16.660
which is done in special lasers
called "mode-locked lasers,"

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.940
you can have a light wave
that looks like this.

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.460
It has an envelope
as it propagates.

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:26.890
In those, the group
velocity is generally

01:29:26.890 --> 01:29:29.710
different than the phase
velocity of the light.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:37.640
Of course I said that earlier
that the other waves are not

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.600
very interesting.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.370
Nevertheless, for educational
and analysis purposes,

01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:44.510
they're simple.

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:46.970
So therefore, we start
with periodic waves

01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:51.130
when we analyze waves,
and periodic is also

01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:53.810
known as "harmonic waves."

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:55.970
And of course, in
a harmonic wave,

01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:58.173
there's no envelope to speak of.

01:29:58.173 --> 01:29:59.840
And therefore, there's
no group velocity

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.860
to speak of because
the envelope is flat.

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.210
There's no profile
going anywhere.

01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:08.990
The only thing you have is
a sinusoidal disturbance

01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:12.770
moving with the phase velocity.

01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:15.980
Here you only have the
carrier, so the only velocity

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.860
to speak of is the
phase velocity.

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.040
That's a characteristic
of the harmonic wave.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.550
And I will start putting
some notation here.

01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:28.620
So the time, you can see that
time is run in index here.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.340
And the horizontal
axis, I will call it z.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:37.020
So we will stick to
z as the actual wave

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.310
propagation for a while.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.360
So now let's do some math.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:49.090
Since this is a harmonic
wave, I can expect

01:30:49.090 --> 01:30:52.280
to describe it as a sinusoid.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.890
And the sinusoid, in
order to characterize it,

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:57.530
I need to set a
number of quantities,

01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:59.840
which have certain buzzwords.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.450
So we'd better start defining
our buzzwords right now,

01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:05.000
so we don't get confused
when we refer to them

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.600
later in the class.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.440
So the constant that goes
in front of the sinusoid

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.780
is called the "amplitude."

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:15.410
The reason I use e as a
symbol for the constant

01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:19.800
is because electromagnetic waves
are usually electric fields.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.200
We will see that later, after
we do Maxwell's equations.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.070
For now, this could be
any symbol, actually.

01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:28.370
In fact, very quickly I will
refer to a different symbol.

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:31.610
But in any case, this
quantity that appears here

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:33.350
is called the amplitude.

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:37.550
Then the other quantity that
we need to describe a sinusoid

01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:38.420
is the frequency.

01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.810
But now the frequency, we have
to be a little bit careful

01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.150
because there's two
frequencies going on.

01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:46.430
You can see very clearly--

01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:49.900
you can think of this as
a snapshot of the wave.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.110
If I take this picture
and I freeze it,

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.710
I will get something
that looks like this.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:59.320
So in this snapshot, the
axis is space coordinate.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.880
It is z.

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.490
So the period that
you observe here,

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:05.410
the period that you
observe in the spatial

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:09.050
axis, it is called
the "wavelength."

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.920
We saw that before.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.220
We did the definition of the
wavelength in, I believe,

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:16.370
lecture number one.

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:17.990
Now suppose I do
like this-- suppose

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:21.410
I fix my position
somewhere on this axis,

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:26.060
and I observe the value of the
wave as it is passing by me.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.750
So now I'm fixed at the
given z and observe the Wave.

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:31.850
What do I observe if
I stand over here?

01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:36.960
I will have another
sinusoid, don't I?

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.940
Because if I am sitting
here, the wave that I see

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.820
will be oscillating.

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:44.700
It will go in the
sinusoidal fashion.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.920
It will oscillate
from a positive value

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.300
to a negative value.

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:55.050
So that actually associates
with a temporal frequency

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:59.290
of the wave, for which we
simply use the term "frequency."

01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:03.970
So we'll say frequency, we
mean the temporal frequency.

01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:07.290
And some people use f.

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:11.550
I prefer to use the symbol
nu for that quantity.

01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:17.130
Finally, I have not
defined my time axis yet.

01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:20.820
So when I'm looking at the
oscillation, if I'm fixed

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.000
and I look at the oscillation
of the wave, at time 0,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.150
the wave might be
absolute positive.

01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:31.790
In that case, it means
the wave is a cosine.

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:33.730
Or it may be 0.

01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:36.490
In that case, it
means it is a sine.

01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:40.210
And how do I correct
for this discrepancy?

01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:43.080
By adding a phase delay,
by adding, for example

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.590
in this case, pi over 2.

01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:46.370
So this additional
phase that I need

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.930
to add in order to
fix the origin of time

01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:51.570
is called the "phase delay."

01:33:51.570 --> 01:33:57.960
And for a while, I will use the
symbol phi for the phase delay.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.080
So we defined basically all of
the quantities that we need,

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:06.930
except nu is not anywhere
to be seen in this equation.

01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:10.830
What I've written instead is
this expression z minus ct.

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:12.876
And what is the meaning
of this expression?

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.658
AUDIENCE: Traveling wave.

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:26.450
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
It's a traveling wave,

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:29.640
or another way to put it is a
traveling coordinate system.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:44.570
If I write-- we have
no doubt what this is.

01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:46.340
That's a sinusoid.

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:50.180
Now, that's a sinusoid in
an axis of coordinate xi.

01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:59.830
If I now say xi
equals z minus c t,

01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:03.920
where t is time, what I have
done is I've taken this axis

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.120
and I've started moving it
with respect to its rest

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.310
position that equals 0.

01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:12.940
So this is what I've done in
the expression for the wave.

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:16.540
I've put this traveling
coordinate system

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.340
into the sinusoid.

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:22.310
And I don't really have
the frequency in here,

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:25.030
but you can see that
time, the time variable,

01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:27.040
is in the expression
for the sinusoid.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.340
So I can get the
frequency very easily.

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:31.690
And the way I get
it is by observing

01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:35.710
that since the wave is
periodic in the time domain,

01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:38.320
it will repeat one period later.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.480
So the period is the
inverse of the frequency.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:46.560
So if I look at this
expression over here,

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:47.720
let me rewrite the wave.

01:36:03.419 --> 01:36:05.010
I can actually write it--

01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:15.550
I haven't done anything,
just expanded the parameters.

01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:24.840
So when this quantity becomes
2 pi or any integral multiple

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.020
thereof, the wave
will repeat, won't it?

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:32.070
So that will happen
when the time

01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:34.680
equals the period of the wave.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.440
Or another way to put it is
that 2 pi over lambda times

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.980
c over nu, where nu
is the frequency,

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.110
the inverse of the
period, here comes the pi.

01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:45.840
Of course, the pi goes away,
and we derive something

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.680
that we've seen before,
c equals lambda nu.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.990
And that is what we used to
call the "dispersion relation."

01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:58.560
So this is how we
connect the phase

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.874
velocity of the wave with the
wavelength and the frequency.

01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:15.210
And the phase delay is actually
a very important property

01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:17.820
of waves, but it's
not a real big deal.

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:19.330
This is what I
was saying before.

01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:19.860
AUDIENCE: George.

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:20.902
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

01:37:20.902 --> 01:37:23.610
AUDIENCE: Why is it called
"dispersion relation?"

01:37:23.610 --> 01:37:25.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes,
there's no dispersion

01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:28.540
to be seen here, isn't there?

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:34.760
However, if I put, for example
an index of refraction, then

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.760
the index of refraction
is a function of lambda,

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.680
so then you'll get dispersion.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.780
And of course,
another case is this

01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:43.540
is the dispersion
relation in free space.

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:46.640
If you put boundary conditions
to the wave-- for example,

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.460
if you confine it
in a wave guide--

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.070
the dispersion relation changes.

01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:52.780
I will not do this
in this class,

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:55.220
but that's another way where
the wave becomes dispersive.

01:37:58.613 --> 01:38:00.530
So that is the explanation
of the phase delay.

01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:02.730
I don't want to
spend too much time.

01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:05.560
If it equals 0, you see this.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.000
This means the wave is a
cosine, the phase delay is 0.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.630
And then, depending on
what you see at t equals 0,

01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.730
you may have different
phase delays.

01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:19.367
Now, the reason the phase
delay is an important quantity

01:38:19.367 --> 01:38:21.450
is because I want you to
look at it very carefully

01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:24.860
and tell me what you see.

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:30.233
So anybody want to volunteer
what has happened here?

01:38:30.233 --> 01:38:31.650
I'm going to play
this once again.

01:38:41.097 --> 01:38:43.430
How are the two different,
on the left and on the right?

01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:57.910
On the left, again, look
at it very carefully.

01:38:57.910 --> 01:39:02.860
On the left, the
two spherical waves,

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.950
they're always bright
together or dark together.

01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:08.750
So they oscillate,
as we say, in phase.

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:12.020
On the right, the two
waves are out of phase.

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.690
So if you look at
it carefully, you

01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:17.290
will see that when one is
bright, the other is dark,

01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:18.280
and vice versa.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.095
I'll play it again
so you can see it.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.670
And because of this, again, I'm
going to play it once again.

01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:34.460
And now don't look at the
centers of the waves anymore,

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.210
but look at the
general patterns.

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.340
You will see that the
general patterns are actually

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.660
different.

01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:43.510
They have the same
general shape,

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:49.000
but whether the pattern is dark
or bright at any given instant

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.450
actually depends on how
the two waves started.

01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:56.470
So when we have-- this
is quantum superposition,

01:39:56.470 --> 01:40:01.010
because I have waves
originating from two sources

01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:02.680
simultaneously.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.200
When we have a
superposition, the structure

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.660
of the overall wave
that we observe

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:13.420
depends very strongly on the
relative phase between the two,

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:14.710
the two sources in this case.

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.280
So with that, I
think I will stop,

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.220
and we will continue on Monday.

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.330
And I will not post any
new notes for Monday,

01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:27.250
because what I think we're
far enough behind that we

01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:29.860
should catch up on Monday.

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:34.410
What I would like to say is
that it is about time to start

01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:38.320
the project for the
graduate class, for 2.710.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.330
So soon, but not for--

01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:47.670
basically by Thursday morning
Boston time and hopefully

01:40:47.670 --> 01:40:51.250
earlier, I will
post in the website

01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:53.980
a list of possible projects
and some instructions

01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.180
on what to do.

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.720
And then basically, what I
would like you guys to do

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.530
is spend the next week
selecting your project,

01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:05.500
and also contacting
your mentors.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.700
Each project will be mentored
by one of my graduate students,

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.200
and some by me.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.970
So possibly, I don't
know if Colin, you

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:14.512
might be interested
in mentoring one,

01:41:14.512 --> 01:41:17.070
but anyway, we'll figure it out.

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.770
Maybe Sam from
Singapore, maybe not.

01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:25.520
But anyway, we will assign
mentors for the projects,

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.985
and then we'll get them started.

01:41:26.985 --> 01:41:30.700
The presentation is in
May, May 6 or May 7.

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:33.570
But anyway, the sooner
we start, the better.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.550
In this lecture, we'll
see how optimization

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.700
can be used to construct
sports schedules.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.360
Specifically, we'll
introduce the method

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.830
of integer optimization.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.710
Sports is a $300
billion industry.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.500
This is twice as big as
the automobile industry

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.030
and seven times as big
as the movie industry.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.810
This includes tickets for
games, team merchandise,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.620
salaries for players, etc.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.330
Almost every single
country participates

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.380
in the sports industry.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.620
For this industry to
remain so large sports

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.990
teams are very important.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.110
They key revenue for sports
teams comes from TV networks.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.840
TV networks paid
$513 million per year

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.590
for English Premier League
soccer, $766 million

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.170
per year for the National
Basketball Association, or NBA,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.860
and $3 billion per year for
the National Football League,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.610
or NFL.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.730
These TV networks are
paying such large amounts

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.600
to ensure that they will have
a good schedule of sports games

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.250
to convince fans to
tune in and watch

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.570
the games on their network.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.100
In addition to the TV
networks, good sports schedules

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.750
are important for
other reasons too.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.340
One is that extensive traveling,
caused by a poor schedule,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.190
can cause player fatigue, which
can reflect badly on the team.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.370
Also, ticket sales tend to
be better on the weekends,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.450
so teams like to
have games scheduled

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.410
for weekends to
increase revenue.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.460
Additionally, it's better
to play division teams,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.479
or direct competitors
for playoff spots,

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.740
near the end of the season since
teams have more information.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.910
For these reasons and many more,
everyone in the sports industry

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.820
is incentivized to have
a good schedule of games.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.440
All competitive sports
require schedules

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.100
defining which pairs of teams
play each other and when.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.860
Until recently, sports
schedules were mostly

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.800
constructed by hand.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.340
This is incredibly
time consuming.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.530
With just 10 teams, there
are over one trillion

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.090
possible schedules, where every
team plays every other team.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.900
There are many
constraints defined

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.630
by the TV networks,
teams, cities, and others.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.650
TV networks want games
to occur at prime times,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.090
like in the evening.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.560
Teams want games
on the weekends.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.570
Cities want games
that don't conflict

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.970
with other major events, etc.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.510
This requires looking through
all trillion possible schedules

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.270
to find one that satisfies
all of the constraints.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.370
For major league baseball,
a husband and wife team

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.960
constructed the
schedules for 24 years.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360
They mostly built
the schedule by hand

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.370
and used a giant wall of
magnets to schedule 2,430 games

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.970
each year.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.070
Not only is this
approach time consuming,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.610
but it's very difficult
to add new constraints.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.220
If one new constraint is added
that might make the schedule

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.170
infeasible and the process would
have to start all over again.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.230
There have been many
interesting constraints

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.280
that have been added
by interesting people.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.970
In 2008, the owners
and TV networks

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.200
were not the only ones who
cared about the schedule.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.280
President Barack Obama
and Senator John McCain

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.600
complained about the schedule.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800
2008 was an election
year and President Obama

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.079
and Senator McCain were the
leading presidential nominees.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.430
The Democratic and Republican
National Conventions

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.640
conflicted with
the game scheduling

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.570
so the schedule
had to be adjusted.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.450
After that was settled, the Pope
complained about the schedule.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.470
The Pope visited New
York on April 20, 2008.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.270
He traditionally always
holds mass in Yankee Stadium,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.950
but a game was
scheduled that same day.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.170
The schedule had
to be readjusted

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.480
to move the Yankee game.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.600
These are just a couple
examples of the wide variety

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.820
of constraints that
have to be accounted

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.000
for when building
a sports schedule.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.350
Recognizing how difficult it was
to construct sports schedules

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.710
by hand, in 1996
a company called

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.320
the Sports Scheduling
Group was started.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.450
The founders were Doug
Bureman, a former baseball vice

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.130
president, and three academics--
George Nemhauser, Michael

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.310
Trick, and Kelly Easton.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.280
Instead of generating
sports schedules by hand,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.330
they use a computer.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.130
They've been scheduling
college sports since 1999

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.560
and major league
baseball since 2005.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.820
They rely on optimization to
build the schedules, which

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.560
can easily adapt when new
constraints are added.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.420
In this lecture, we'll introduce
one of the techniques they use,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.790
called integer optimization,
to construct a sports schedule.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.580
Let's get going here.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.410
So this week I'll be talking
about bacteria and viruses.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.380
And these are really
significant topics,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.260
because I think it's
something that we often

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.229
don't think about the
magnitude of the problems

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.590
and what kind of crises
we're approaching

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.750
with respect to the
therapeutic treatment

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.252
of infectious disease.

00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:40.960
So what I want to try
and get home to you

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.400
this week is the variety
of different microorganisms

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.490
that threaten our
health, and just

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.440
talk to you about
the sorts of issues

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.520
that are really prominent in
the news concerning resistance

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.170
to therapeutic agents.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.000
But in order to do that, we've
got to meet some bacteria,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.810
meet some viruses,
and understand

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.989
that some of their
lifestyles, their mechanisms,

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.890
so that we can understand
what kinds of agents

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.790
are used and developed to try
to mitigate these diseases,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.190
because it's only through
a molecular mechanistic

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.300
understanding of the life
cycles of viruses and bacteria

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.410
that we can understand how many
of these therapeutic agents

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.450
work and what may be happening
in resistance development.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.410
Now I find this particular
slide a little daunting,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.770
but I want to point out to you
that it concerns the world's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.450
deadliest animals.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.660
So we worry a lot about
tigers, and sharks,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.250
and things like that,
nasty poisonous snakes,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.550
bites from dogs with
rabies, and so on.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.030
I'm going to leave this black
bar here, sort of unmentioned.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.760
I don't know what year this is,
but if we talk about daunting,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.140
that's pretty serious.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.220
And then the biggest killer on
this screen is the mosquito.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.560
But it isn't actually
the mosquito,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.500
it's the protozoal
microorganisms

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.039
that the mosquito carries
from one person to another

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.950
that really make that such
a serious consideration.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.180
But what's not here are all
the bacteria and viruses that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780
actually are far more serious.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.230
And the numbers
on the next stage

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.100
will show you just quite how
shocking these numbers are.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.360
If you're interested
in infectious disease

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.610
as a field, because I think
anyone going towards MD,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.625
MD/PhD infectious
diseases, it really

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.940
is a critical area that we
have to get to grips with.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.680
There are not enough
vaccines in the world.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.900
There is not enough
treatment with a very microbe

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.640
specific anti-infective agents.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.203
So I encourage you
to look at the CDC.

00:02:57.203 --> 00:02:58.870
There's a few other
places where there's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.730
loads of information collated,
such as the NIAID, which

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.000
is the NIH Center for
Infectious Disease,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.710
and the World
Health Organization.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.350
So there's lots of places
where you can find stuff out.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.770
So what we're going to be
talking about in the next three

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.710
classes are our smallest
enemies, things like bacteria,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.970
fungal infections from things
like yeast or Aspergillus,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.780
which would cause candida
and aspergillosis.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.370
Protozoal disease
we won't mention,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.010
but those are the
types of diseases

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.540
that are carried by things
like ticks, mosquitoes,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.520
tsetse flies.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.990
We think of those as
the infectious agent,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.630
but it's really what those
organisms carry and cause

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.060
the spread of disease
that's important there.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.420
And we won't either talk
about prion diseases, which

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.090
are the diseases
that don't involve

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.220
an infectious
microorganism, but are

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.700
believed to be spread
from protein to protein

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.080
through the nucleation of new
prions from existing prions.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.900
What we'll focus on
in the first class

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.790
is bacteria and in the
other two on viruses,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.550
with an eye to
looking at antibiotics

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.730
and antiviral agents, how they
work, where they go wrong.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.120
And this is where the
numbers get fairly shocking.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.210
So for example,
bacterial infections

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.320
of the lower respiratory tract,
that's deep in the lungs,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.330
cause 4 million deaths a year.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.530
Think back to the numbers you
just saw on that first slide.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.340
These are things like
strep pneumoniae,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.140
Klebsiella pneumoniae.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.970
They're called pneumonias
because they're

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.150
infectious diseases of the
lung, but the organisms

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.650
that cause them are of the
Streptomyces, and Klebsiella,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.950
and Staphylococcus
aureus specifically.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.820
But there are others that
cause lung infections and lower

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.840
respiratory disease.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.580
These are particularly
troublesome in areas

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.520
where the atmosphere is bad.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.250
In big cities where there's a
lot of insult from emissions

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.470
and such that make
the lungs weaker,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.970
then these sorts of
organisms can really

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.420
take a hold more readily,
so they are more serious.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.510
There are many,
many microorganisms

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.650
that cause pneumonias.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.500
And sometimes it's
a real problem

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.370
to track down the precise
microorganism, which

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.540
makes the issue of treatment
really difficult, really

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.590
challenging.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.160
So I'm going to talk in a minute
about absolute identification

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.090
of infectious agents, so we can
do better jobs of specifically

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.410
targeting the causative agents.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.660
Diarrheal disease--
2 million deaths.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.510
These are organisms like
Campylobacter jejuni

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.670
and Salmonella enterica.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.780
We tend to have these
crises, because romaine my

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.060
is contaminated with infection.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.330
There are very few deaths
in the developed world.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.840
We get down to
that very quickly,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.780
say stop eating Romaine
lettuce until we figure out

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.310
what's going on here--

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.730
very, very few.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.970
But once again, in
the developing world,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.770
these can run rampant.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.250
And they can grab small
children and older people who

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.210
are already compromised,
already a little bit not quite

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.260
with strong immune systems,
and people generally

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.620
die of dehydration, because
these diseases really

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.940
hit the GI tract.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.240
It causes leaking us in the
GI tract and really, really

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.870
serious diarrheal disease.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.620
So those are the bad boys there.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.660
But once again, there
are many others.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.980
Tuberculosis is yet
another really serious

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.600
infectious disease caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.860
that's the main one of the
mycobacteria that is a threat.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.510
It used to be called
consumption in the old days,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.640
because people almost looked
consumed by the disease.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.550
They would just get
thinner and thinner.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.190
Literally it was
a wasting disease.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.160
People would be sent up into
the mountains of Switzerland

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.860
to try to recover
from consumption,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.860
to where the air is
clearer and cleaner,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.410
and maybe hope that
they can recuperate.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.410
But TB-- look at these numbers.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.640
In 2015 there were almost
10 million new cases.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.950
There are about 1.2
million deaths from TB.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.800
A serious situation with
TB is that it's often

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.880
found co-infecting with the
HIV virus, where you just

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.200
can't fight the TB.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.430
So eventually, if you're
infected with the HIV virus,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.630
it's the TB that gets you
due to the weakening caused

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.580
by the infection with TB.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.710
So these numbers are
shocking in light

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.650
of the numbers I showed you
on the previous slide, right.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.210
Look at these numbers if you go
to snakes and things like that.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.430
They're meaningless
numbers compared

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.880
to infectious diseases.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:22.160
So now, and I'm going to talk to
you about the origins of this,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.360
many, many infectious
agents that we thought we

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.680
had conquered--

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.180
we thought we could
take care of it.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.004
You just take this course of
antibiotics and you're off,

00:08:33.004 --> 00:08:34.100
you're set.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.880
But now, because of the
rapid mutation rates

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.570
in bacteria and viruses,
certain pathogens

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.420
have completely
worked out mechanisms

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.520
to escape therapeutic agent.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.680
And I'm going to talk to
you about those mechanisms

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.690
towards the end of this class.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.780
So basically you can
dose a person one day

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.750
with a normal dose of
an antibiotic agent,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.620
and then 10 months later
that normal dose or 10 times

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.740
or 100 times that
dose stops working.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.940
Why is that?

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.870
It's due to resistance
acquisition due to rapid cell

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:14.360
division and mistakes made on
replication and transcription,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.150
that then may one
in a million times

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.510
confer an advantage
on the microorganism.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.610
All of a sudden the
drugs don't work anymore.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:30.530
The WHO and various
community notice boards

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.320
call this set of infectious
agents the escape pathogens.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.790
It helps us remember
which ones these are,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.480
because these are pathogens
that escape treatment,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.880
because they've
developed resistance

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.310
to multiple drug cocktails.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.550
So commonly, when someone
has a particular disease

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.460
they don't take one drug,
they take two or three

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.210
to hit lots of pathways
at once in the hope

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.610
that resistance
won't develop fast.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.820
But the escape pathogens
have collectively

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.910
acquired resistance to
several antibiotics,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.460
meaning there's
no good treatment.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.440
So the letters of escape stand
for Enterococcus faecium,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.030
Staph aureus, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Acinetobacter

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.210
baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and some

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.090
of the Enterobacter species.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:30.210
Some of these infectious
agents are what result from--

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.550
I always say this wrong--

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.560
nosocomial infections.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.680
Does anyone know what those are?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.450
These are infections that
people get in hospitals.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.280
So Tom Brady had
a knee operation.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.730
He got an infection in his knee
that came from the surgery,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.330
right.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.970
These are hospital
acquired infections,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:56.370
because you can't sometimes
clear an area enough,

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.710
and there's infectious
agents around.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.240
So Acinetobacter baumannii
was dubbed the Iraqi Bug

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.200
for many, many years, because
the vets coming back from Iraq

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.080
were going to
military hospitals,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.230
and these were
abundant with cases

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.390
of Acinetobacter baumannii.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.900
So that moved on to the
escape pathogen list.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.090
So these are things
to watch out for.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.880
It's the reason that
nosocomial infections--

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.590
I hope I'm saying
it right, otherwise

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.260
you're going to go off
and Google it and realize

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.470
I said it wrong.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.060
It's the reason why old school
physicians wore bow ties

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.640
and not ties.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.490
Can you imagine why?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.800
So if you're wearing
a tie, which I seldom

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.790
wear to be honest, and you're
working over a patient,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.850
the tie can be the thing
that carries the infection,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.520
because it gets closer
to infected areas.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.140
This is old school stuff.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.230
And so originally the
physicians wore bow ties

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.300
in order to distinguish
themselves as important people,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.460
but not to wear ties that
might carry infectious agents.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.530
That's sort of a scary thing.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.460
So with all this
said, let me just

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.760
lead you in to talk about
bacteria antibiotics

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.600
and resistance development.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:20.250
So we often name bacteria
somewhat by their shape.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.110
So the long rod
shaped ones are cocci.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.580
The round ones are cocci.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.710
The rod ones, whatever they
are, come on one of you.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.680
And then what did
the rod shape ones?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.990
Bacilli.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.870
I had a blank moment.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.510
So the rod shaped
ones are bacilli.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.160
And then there's
some others that

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.550
have a different morphology
like Campylobacter jejuni

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.860
that have kind of
a corkscrew shape.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.010
And that's thought to be
important in their motility,

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.990
digging through
the mucous layers

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.830
in the epithelial layers.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.933
So here I show you several
shapes of bacteria.

00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:58.350
And I'm just going
to, once again,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.950
reinforce what diseases
some are associated

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.430
with and some other diseases
that you might be surprised by.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.180
So yes, we know about
salmonella and the E.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.750
coli and food poisoning.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.600
But Helicobacter
pylori, which is

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.690
one of these
flagellated bacteria,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.900
can infect the stomach.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.000
It's often the cause of ulcers.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.120
So it's a causative
agent of stomach ulcers,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.250
but that has in turn led
to a considerable risk

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.960
factor in stomach cancer.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.380
So what we thought
was just an infection

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.340
causes a constellation of other
problems, including cancers.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.880
And more and more
microbial agents

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:47.510
are now associated with cancers,
in particular the viruses.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.060
Neisseria, these come
along with the sexually

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.280
transmitted diseases
such as gonorrhea.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.135
Neisseria meningitidis is the
one that causes meningitis.

00:13:57.135 --> 00:14:02.700
It is a very, very often fatal
infection of the meninges.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.420
Staph aureus lots of
infections around the body,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.580
just gruesome things
like cellulitis,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.310
wound infections, toxic shock.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.200
Streptococcal
bacteria, I've already

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.530
mentioned-- the pneumonias,
and then Campylobacter.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.550
And now another complicated
factor of infection--

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:26.490
so I talked to you about stomach
ulcers and stomach cancer.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.210
Another thing that seems to be
coming along with infections

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.890
is autoimmunity.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.550
So in the last section of the
class you heard about immunity

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.880
and you also heard
about tolerance,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.780
that we don't react to
things that are ourselves,

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.940
otherwise we'd be
in deep trouble.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.850
Autoimmunity can
suddenly pop up from

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.670
certain bacterial
infections, because bacteria

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.450
tend to cloak themselves
with unusual sugar

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.850
polymers and other
kinds of structures

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.980
that the body doesn't
really know what to do with.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.500
And in some cases
they kind of mimic

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.780
things that are
in the human body.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.920
So they they are mimetics
of normal structures

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.330
in the human body.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.210
And the body just doesn't
notice them at all.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.300
And then there are
incidences where

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.420
certain bacterial
infections later on

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.830
cause autoimmune disease.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.650
So a bacteria may come along.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.680
It may have something that looks
kind of like something human,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.240
but not quite.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.150
The human body responds,
develops antibodies,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.220
and then they cross talk back
to aspects of our physiology.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.260
So Campylobacter jejuni is
often a contaminant in poultry.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.240
It's a severe GI infection.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.690
But later on people get
diseases such as Guillain-Barre,

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.790
which is a neuropathy where
the ends of your limbs

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.310
become numb and non-functional.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.250
So there was a famous
football player,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.110
the one they called
"The Refrigerator," who

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.160
had a serious case of
Guillain-Barre resulting

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.070
from very much an
infectious disease, which

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.810
converted into autoimmunity.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.660
So let's now look at
antibiotic targets.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.510
And to look at
antibiotic targets,

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.300
I think the first
clear place to look

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.610
is at the bacterial cell wall.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.090
Now when we first started
talking about prokaryotes,

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.260
things that include bacteria,
we talked about the fact

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.690
that these single
celled organisms

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:44.270
have to have a robust cell
wall to prevent osmotic shock.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.770
They have to have
some kind of thing

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.730
to keep them from
taking up too much water

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.420
and basically exploding
because of osmosis.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.530
Water floods in to balance
the salt concentrations.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.260
So they have a
complex cell wall,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:09.500
which is made of a macro
molecule called peptidoglycan

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.650
And it's usually one word,
but I want to just underline

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.940
peptidoglycan because it's
a fascinating polymer that's

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.575
made up of peptides and
linear carbohydrate polymers.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.190
So if you look at this
typical bacterium,

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.910
this is just a cartoon
of the peptidoglycan.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:38.210
So it's a cross-linked
polymer, we

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.250
in one direction it has
repeating carbohydrate units.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.910
I'm not drawing those complex
hexose structures there.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.250
I'm just drawing
it in cartoon form.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.755
And those are carbohydrates
known as NAG and NAN.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:03.140
NAG is N-Acetyl Glucosamine.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.850
It's a hexose sugar.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.420
NAN is N-AcetylMuramic acid.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.890
It's another modified sugar.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.010
And on the one of
those sugars, there

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:19.190
is a reactive site that allows
you to basically cross-link

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.830
these polymers into a mesh work.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.150
So it's a feat of engineering
to build this amazing polymer.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.870
It starts being built on the
inside, on the cytoplasm.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.960
And then the components get
flipped onto the other side

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.660
of the cytoplasm of bacteria.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.120
Then they get
polymerized in place

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.780
to make this complex
mesh work of a polymer

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.190
that creates the rigidity
of the bacterial cell wall.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.270
It's generically known
as a peptidoglycan.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.720
Different bacteria have
different peptidoglycans.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.240
There are several
modifications that

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.430
might be specific to
particular bacterial sera

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.110
But this is the
generic structure,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.600
where you have a polymer
that's built of sugars.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.910
You can recognize the
sugar structure there

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.690
going in one direction and
the peptide component that

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.350
cross-links across in
order to make this mesh.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.350
And bacterial wall have
different amounts of this,

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.770
but it'll build up to a
really strong, rigid mesh

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.370
work that's permeable to things,
small molecules and water.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.960
There is holes, and so on.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.600
But it creates a
mechanical rigidity

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.110
so that osmotic shock doesn't
occur on the bacteria.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.160
Any questions about that?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.230
Does that makes sense?

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.060
So that, in a sense,
it's their exoskeleton,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.670
if you want to think
about it like that.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.610
So the properties are rigid.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.610
Without it, the bacteria
would suffer osmotic shock.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:52.160
And it's plenty permeable
to allow 2-nanometer type

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.048
pores in order for nutrients and
water to go into the structure.

00:19:57.048 --> 00:19:57.715
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:57.715 --> 00:19:58.965
- --have E. coli growing here.

00:19:58.965 --> 00:19:59.712
And it's living.

00:19:59.712 --> 00:20:00.920
You can see it start to grow.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.110
Here we add penicillin.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.568
We're going to see
these bacteria--

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:06.440
PROFESSOR: These are
bacteria, rod-shaped bacteria.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.495
- There wasn't any
microphone on this, so--

00:20:08.495 --> 00:20:10.870
PROFESSOR: And I'm going to
ask you to just keep watching

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:11.900
this kind of carefully.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.442
- There goes another
one, boop, boop.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.300

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.390
- Poking holes in the cell
wall, boom, bacteria is dead.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.750
PROFESSOR: Look at some of
the bacteria disappearing.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.160
All right, I guess

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.370

So we're going to leave it.

00:20:31.237 --> 00:20:31.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.390
Let's go back one.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.630
OK, now what was that?

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.430
OK, so I've told you bacteria
would suffer osmotic shock

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.980
without peptidoglycan.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.440
Those are bacteria
that you see popping,

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.490
as the person who
was talking said,

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.880
because the peptidoglycan
cannot be made.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.910
There is an antibiotic
that's added.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.990
It is penicillin that's
added to the bacteria.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.370
And it stops-- as bacteria grow,
they have to make a bunch more

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.910
peptidoglycan, because
if you're doubling,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.930
you've got to make
twice as much peptido--

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.420
you've got to double the
amount of peptidoglycan.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.880
If you have something
that inhibits

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.090
the peptidoglycan
being made, you

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.660
have a bacterium that's trying
to stretch out what it has,

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.310
it's not resistant
to osmotic shock.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.030
And what you saw was the
bacteria basically undergoing

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.230
cell death via osmotic shock,
pretty graphic, pretty visual.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:36.470
So penicillin was one
of the first antibiotics

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.660
that was described
for the treatment

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.850
of bacterial infections.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.980
And we'll go to the timeline
of that in a moment.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.660
So when we talk about bacteria,
the original definition

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:54.920
of bacteria is in three
different subtypes,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:06.030
gram-negative, gram-positive,
and mycobacterial.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.500
This is actually the
first way that people

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.920
would take a look at your
cell-- at the bacterial cells

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.240
and diagnose roughly what
kind of bacteria they were.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.480
Did they fall-- which
of these broad families

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.530
did they fall into?

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.900
Because it would
help in defining how

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.550
you would treat the
infectious disease.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:42.450
So I want to show you the
difference between the cell

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:47.220
wall of these various
types of bacteria.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.030
And the truth is, if you
have an infectious disease,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.770
your wish is, if you had
to pick one of the three,

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.150
that you have a
gram-positive disease.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.870
And I'll explain why
that is in a moment,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:05.130
because it's all to do with how
drugs can get into the bacteria

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.880
to inhibit vital functions
in order that they die

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.290
and they don't take
over your system.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.860
So let's look first at
gram-positive bacteria.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.760
They're shown here.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.720
This is a section
of a bacterium.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.750
Gram-positive have
a single cell wall.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:35.760
And they also have a thick
layer of peptidoglycan.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.610
So they gain
rigidity by basically

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.750
having an extracellular
thick layer of peptidoglycan

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.310
coating them.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.080
There is a schematic of it here.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.420
So here would be
the inner cell wall.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.760
And here would be
the peptidoglycan,

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.040
shown in orange and pale,
buff-colored circles.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.010
So that would be where
their peptidoglycan is.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.580
And then there are some
other glyco conjugates that

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.060
actually stick out beyond that.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.230
But there is only one
cytoplasmic membrane.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.440
That's the standard
double bilayer.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.550
And the peptidoglycan is
quite thick, relatively,

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.550
20 to 80 nanometers across.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.860
So that's how wide it is.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.200
And you can, if you've
got a-- if you've

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.330
stain a bacterium
under a microscope,

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.480
you would see that, the
thickness of that wall,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.980
but the absence
of a double wall.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.420
The gram-negative bacteria
have a double wall.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:52.030
The inner membrane
is pretty standard.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.600
It's just typical phospholipids.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.020
It looks like the inner
cytoplasmic membrane

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.230
of the gram-positive bacteria.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:05.440
And then it has an outer wall.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.000
So the inner
membrane is typical.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.610
And then the outer
wall has one leaflet

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.320
that looks kind of normal.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.200
And then it has a second leaflet
that's sort of decorated,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.180
honestly, like a Christmas tree.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.130
There is all kinds of
things sticking out

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.150
there that interact with hosts
that they infect, and so on.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.180
And the space
between the two walls

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:44.280
is called the periplasmic
space, because it's between.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.120
It's not the cytoplasm.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480
It's what's called
the periplasm.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.325
Now, what's interesting
about these,

00:25:50.325 --> 00:25:54.270
the gram-negative bacteria,
is they have quite a bit

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:59.692
less peptidoglycan, only
about 7 to 8 nanometers.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.250
So that's pretty interesting.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.720
But they sort of gain robustness
from that second wall structure

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.040
that's coating on the outside.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.260
Now, their challenge with
gram-negative bacteria relative

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.460
to gram-positive bacteria is any
drugs you develop have to make

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.780
a pretty--

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.260
if they're targeted at
intracellular sites,

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.860
they have to get through two
walls, not just one wall.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.020
So they are harder to treat.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.300
And they also have a
lot of characteristics

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.420
that make them more prone
to resistance development.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.080
So I want to point out to you,
on this electron micrograph,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.400
you can actually see the double
wall, the dark band of space

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.280
and then another dark
band, whereas here you

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.160
see a thin single
wall, but you see

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.080
a lot of junk on the outside.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.640
Is everyone seeing
the differences just

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.850
to look at them?

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:05.690
OK, so what's this
gram thing about?

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.310
What does this stand for?

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:29.220
It simply stands for a chemical
dye that stains peptidoglycan.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.240
And it was invented or
discovered by Professor Gram.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.110
That was his name.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.960
So when someone says you got
a gram-positive infection,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.420
gram-negative
infection, it's how

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.870
those cells look when they've
been treated with this stain.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:48.240
Gram positives show up
very positive to the stain

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.790
because there is a
lot of peptidoglycan

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.950
on the outside that absorbs the
dye and shows a strong color.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:01.500
The gram-negatives don't show
very well with a Gram stain,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.520
because the peptidoglycan
is tucked in the periplasm,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.870
not on the outside of the cell.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.580
So if someone does a quick
check on a bacterial streak

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.380
or an infection
that you have, they

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.180
might treat it
with the Gram stain

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.360
and say gram-positive
or gram-negative just

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.490
based on that simple
color analysis.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.360
And so in one case,
the peptidoglycan

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.370
is abundant and accessible.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.660
In the other case, it's very,
very much thinner and less

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.400
accessible to the dyes.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.770
Now, this probably looks
like stone-age stuff

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.530
to you, because how
much can you learn

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.020
by these simple
colorimetric stains?

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.470
We're certainly moving in very,
very different directions.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.450
But let me just finish off with
the third type of bacteria,

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:58.050
the mycobacteria, which include
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.920
And they have a different
kind of wall, again.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.340
And they're pretty unusual.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.950
And they are really,
really hard to treat,

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.610
because it's almost impossible
to get therapeutic agents

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.530
into mycobacteria.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.490
I used to work on a team
with Novartis in Singapore.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.070
And they said, doing
anything with mycobacteria

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.490
was like trying to do
biochemistry on a wax candle,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.092
literally.

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.800
You just can't work
with it, because they

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.920
have a thick additional wall
that's kind of different again.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.040
Did you have a question?

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.540
No.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.360
Sorry, I thought I
saw your hand up.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.750
So what they have
is a typical cell

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.660
wall then some
peptidoglycan, but then they

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.760
have this thick
mycobacterial layer

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.720
which comprises what are
known as mycolic acids, which

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.640
basically add this thick layer
of greasy hydrophobic material

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.600
on the outside of the
mycobacteria that's

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.120
pretty impenetrable.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.040
The cell wall is
quite different.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.110
It doesn't have an outer coat.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.430
It's like gram-positives
in that respect.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.215
But it doesn't
stain very strongly.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:20.010
So it has a weak, what's
known as Gram stain.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.510
So sometimes if
you've got something

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.780
that gives a sort a so-so
response to the Gram stain,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.690
you might say, oh, it
looks like a mycobacterium

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.310
because of what's happening.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:34.110
Now, mycobacteria
TB is a huge threat,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:39.190
because its treatment, its
current treatment-- and it's

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.400
the same treatment that's
been around for, like, 30

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.370
years or something-- is
a treatment with four

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.280
different antibacterial
agents that

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.490
hit a bunch of different
sites in the lifecycle

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.050
of the bacteria.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.780
It includes these
compounds shown here

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:03.880
which are isoniazid, rifampicin,
ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.610
And it's a six-month treatment
with those medications,

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:12.430
so handful, four different
medications for six months.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.520
So what they were realizing
in the developing world

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.920
is that there was
terrible compliance.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.680
The drugs are cheap, but
there was no compliance.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.590
People just were not taking the
pills, because they're like,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.490
I'm tired of taking these
pills every day for six months.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.570
So what was developed was what's
known as the DOTs program.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.300
Has anyone never heard of this?

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.590
Is anyone interested
in infectious disease?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.810
It was a situation where it
was a social system set up

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.730
in order to make
sure people took

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:47.500
these drugs every day for six
months in order to comply.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.400
So social workers would go to
the villages in remote areas

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.330
and watch people
take the medications.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.470
So it's directly
observed treatment

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.380
to make sure they followed
through, because if they had

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.630
regular TB, not very resistant
TB, you could overcome it,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.970
provided that you took
these medications.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.610
But still, it's a hugely
debilitating thing

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.710
to have to deal with
these treatments.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.950
Now, there are
two strains of TB.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.360
One is called MDR-TB.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.590
And the other ones called
XMDR-TB You'll occasionally

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:25.720
hear of these on TV programs.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.920
MDR is resistant to three
of the four medications.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.600
And XMDR, which stands for
extremely MultiDrug Resistant,

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.180
is resistant to every single
one of those medications.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.660
New medications, different
mechanisms of action

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.072
are sorely needed.

00:32:43.072 --> 00:32:44.530
All right, this is
just what things

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.960
look like with the Gram stains.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.340
So here you see gram-positive
Bacillus anthracis.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.187
That's the deep purple rods.

00:32:54.187 --> 00:32:56.020
You know that's a
gram-positive because it's

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.180
a deep purple stain.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.730
The other cells in this
picture are white cells.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.330
So you can really pick
out the gram-positive.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.510
This is the structure
of the chemical dye

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.720
that stains peptidoglycan
through absorbing

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.300
into the peptidoglycan.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.490
It's a very sort of
physical interaction

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.950
of the dye with the polymer.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.160
And over on this slide, it's
a mixture of gram-positive

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.540
and gram-negative.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.040
And you can pick up
the gram-positive

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.740
and differentiate them from
the gram-negative, which

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.620
just stains sort of
kind of weakly pink.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.700
And then mycobacteria, which
are formerly gram-positive,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.210
don't stain very well
because of that thick mycolic

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.400
acid hydrophobic wall.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.170
So what would you do nowadays?

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.800
Would you pull out a stain
and drop it on bacteria

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.680
and get some vague response?

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.880
What's open to you now
in the 21st century?

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.630
You have a tiny
sample of a bacterium.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.200
Grow it up.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.950
What would you do?

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.740
You could tell
exactly what it is.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.680
AUDIENCE: PCR.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you'd
PCR up the genomic DNA

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.000
and then go match it, because
the thing that we, in addition

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.179
to the human genome,
there are thousands

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:20.219
of pathogenic bacteria sequences
that are completely annotated,

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.090
known.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.929
The [INAUDIBLE] has a massive
compilation of these sequences.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.840
And you just go and you
find out what the bacterium

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.710
is based on the sequence.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.340
So now rapid
sequencing efforts--

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.739
maybe they're just a few number
of key places in a genome

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.699
that you would go towards and
just do a really fast array

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:46.110
and figure out what's there and
within what bacterium it is,

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.500
which gives you a much better
clue as to how to treat it

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.659
than the vague,
ambiguous stains.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.710
So even though stains keep
going, there is now other ways.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.440
Unfortunately, not everyone
has the instrumentation

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.480
to do rapid sequencing.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.540
So nowadays, there
is a lot, lot,

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.410
lot of interest in faster
dipstick sorts of tests

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.980
that can distinguish between
different bacterial strains

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.500
by, for example, interrogating
that coat of glyco-conjugates

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.780
that's on the outside
of the bacteria,

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.570
dipstick paper tests
that can give you

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.460
an idea of what
organism and what

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.960
serotype so you can move forward
and do a much more rational

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.290
treatment of those organisms.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.210
OK, let's see what's-- yes.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:38.280
All right, so where did the
antibiotics first come from?

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.340
Any questions so far?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.355
OK, so where did the first
antibiotics come from?

00:35:45.355 --> 00:35:48.370
From a couple of
accidental discoveries.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:52.690
Who has heard of the
Fleming experiment?

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.610
Who knows about that
discovery of penicillin?

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.470
Yeah, so there was an
original observation

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.140
that predated that which
sort of suggests that Pasteur

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.620
was a pretty smart guy,
because he contributed

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.790
in a lot of different areas.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:12.830
He discovered that some bacteria
tend to release substances

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.140
that kill other bacteria.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.250
That was in the 1870s.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.590
Then later on, there
was another sort

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.440
of spread of antibiotic agents.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.920
And it came with the
discovery that we had things

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.500
like arsenic
derivatives actually

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:36.080
showed some value in
treating the organism that

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.520
causes syphilis.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.700
So talk about the
treatment being--

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.200
the cure being worse
than the infection.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.110
People were being
treated, seriously,

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:48.980
with these arsenic derivatives
in the hope of wiping out

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.170
the infectious agent
that caused syphilis.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.990
But you know, sometimes
it was a mixed bag.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.010
But where things started to get
a lot more interesting was that

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.720
in 1928, there was this sort
of famous historic story

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:08.330
of Fleming discovering
that some bacteria seemed

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:15.590
to be inhibited by a particular
agent that came from a fungus.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.360
And this was the
origin of penicillin.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.590
So he would have a Petri dish
where he was growing bacteria.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.380
And he noticed that in
some of his samples,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.930
there was inhibition
of bacterial growth

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.990
due to an exogenous
agent that had somehow

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.600
contaminated the plates.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.840
So in that story,
that was the substance

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.600
that was named as penicillin.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.660
The mold from the--
mold is the fungus--

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.200
actually inhibited the growth
of staphylococcus bacteria.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.150
And it was called penicillin.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.300
And then a lot
more time went by.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:56.360
But in the 1940s, the active
ingredient was discovered.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:02.120
So 1940s is sort of slap
bang about, I would say,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.020
a couple of years into
the Second World War.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.150
And they were able to mobilize
the production of this agent.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.710
Towards the later
end of the war,

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.470
people had penicillin
available to them.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.830
And it's basically
pretty well believed

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.460
that, if it wasn't for
the antibiotic agents that

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.690
emerged--

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.060
you know, the war ended in 1945.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.570
If it wasn't for those
agents that emerged,

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.120
there would have been way way,
way more deaths from the war.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.000
As it was, there
were way too many.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.150
So penicillin was
the first antibiotic

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.180
that was discovered with a
discreet mechanism of action.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.880
And it was discovered at a
very, very important time.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.030
So that was all great news.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.230
Penicillin was produced widely.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.620
Some of you may be
allergic to penicillin.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.750
There are other
options nowadays.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.850
But it's the cheapest
and most viable

00:38:55.850 --> 00:39:00.690
of the first-line antibiotics.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.240
Here we go.

00:39:04.216 --> 00:39:06.980
And this thing, this pointer
has a mind of its own.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.460
It sort of changed its mind.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.160
But the problem was
the bacterial species

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.000
started to survive treatment due
to development of resistance.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.250
And all of a sudden, something
that worked really well

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.720
wasn't working anymore.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.880
So let's try and think
about peptidoglycan,

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.120
what penicillin looks
like and what it does,

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.090
and how penicillin
resistance emerges.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.670
Those are the three things
I'm going to cover here.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.190
OK, so what does penicillin do?

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:44.680
Penicillin stops the formation
of this big macromolecular

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.790
peptidoglycan polymer by
stopping the last cross-link,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.010
stopping the
chemistry that happens

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.970
to join the peptide chains to
make a cross-linked polymer.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.640
And anyone who is in the
mechanical engineering area

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.910
will know that polymers
that are just strands

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.980
are much weaker
than polymers that

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.900
are crossed-linked
structures which

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.790
have tensile strength
in both directions.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.160
So the uncross-linked
peptidoglycan was weak.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.140
And what penicillin
specifically did

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.350
was inhibit forming
that cross-link.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.300
What does penicillin look like?

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.650
Here it is.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.150
It's a cool structure.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.830
It's what's known as a natural
product, five ring, four ring,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.600
an interesting structure.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.050
And what it would do is it
would interact with the enzyme

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.470
the cross-linked
the peptidoglycan

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.240
and basically stop it
dead in its tracks.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.940
What did the bacteria do?

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.210
The key part of this structure
is this four-membered ring

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.210
within amide bond in it.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.980
The bacteria evolved an enzyme
to chop it open basically

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.900
making it completely inactive.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.010
So beta lactamase was evolved
in the bacterial populations.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.040
It was probably derived
from some other enzyme that

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.440
did some useful
function, but not

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.900
targeted to the penicillins.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.140
But the bacteria
started to survive

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.230
because they made a ton of an
enzyme called beta lactamase.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.780
And then it completely
stopped working.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.350
So the chemists came
up with other options,

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.440
because they said, well, you
know, if that doesn't work,

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.950
we've got other
antibiotics in our arsenal.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.840
And there is a
compound that was used

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.400
for years as a last line
of resort antibiotic known

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.020
as vancomycin.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.330
It was very, very important,
so very serious infections,

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.060
and really preserved
for that use.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.710
And they thought that
vancomycin might be a drug that

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.450
just couldn't be defeated.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:50.360
This big molecule
here is vancomycin.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.800
This little piece of peptide
is actually the peptide

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.350
that's in that cross-link.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.300
And vancomycin
basically, like a glove,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.860
sat on that piece of peptide and
stopped it being cross-linked.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.660
And what did the bacteria do?

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.010
They evolved a set of
enzymes to completely change

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.400
that little piece of
peptide into something

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.130
that bound more poorly,
giving you resistance

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.030
to vancomycin as well.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.710
So when there is
one drug involved,

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.390
it's pretty easy to get
resistance quite quickly.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.270
You just mutate one enzyme and
you get a resistant strain.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:33.200
And the enzyme that can beat
the antibiotic will win.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.940
If you've got a compound that
takes five different enzymes

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:46.520
or an antibiotic that has a very
complex mechanism of action,

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.660
you might say, well, this is
never going to be defeated.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.200
It took five additional
enzymes to evolve

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.500
to make the peptidoglycan
a different structure.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.140
And it's not that
within every bacterium,

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.660
you mutate five
different enzymes

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.700
and get them all
working as a team.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.850
What was happening
in these infections

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.760
is that a plasmid with
the set of enzymes

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.880
was being passed around
amongst bacteria.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.170
So a new bacterium could acquire
resistance to this compound

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.080
without evolving a whole
bunch of new enzymes,

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.350
but rather by lateral
transfer of plasmids

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.700
encoding the genes that it
took to make the vancomycin

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.950
inactive.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.280
All right, so let me just
tell you a few of the targets.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.440
And then there is one
movie I want to show you

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.710
that's kind of cool.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:42.950
So currently, when we inhibit
bacteria with antibiotics,

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.020
there are a number of
essential processes

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.240
that are targeted with
common antibiotics.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.480
So this would be a
typical bacterium.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:59.900
One target of action is DNA
synthesis and DNA polymerase.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.510
And the enzyme
that is targeted is

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.690
one we've talked
about, topoisomerase.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.050
And that is inhibited
by the fluoroquinolones

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.700
such as ciprofloxacin that
actually targets specifically

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.050
the bacterial polymerase.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.830
So that's one way,
inhibit DNA replication,

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.690
bacteria can't divide.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:25.130
Another set of
antibiotics are those

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:28.230
that inhibit protein synthesis.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.770
So in particular,
you know the tunnel

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.010
that comes out of the ribosome
where the growing polypeptide

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:38.240
chain emerges after
reading the messenger RNA

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.820
and translating the
messenger into protein?

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.780
There are antibiotics to
basically stick in that tunnel

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.830
and stop protein synthesis.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.610
And those are things
like the aminoglycosides.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.960
And they block exit
from the ribosome.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.600
But you could imagine
that mutating.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.330
There are the ones that
inhibit cell wall biosynthesis

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.540
that I've already talked
to about, the penicillins,

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.680
the vancoymcin.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.820
And then there are others
that inhibit folate synthesis.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.430
And then there is a
lot of synthetic drugs,

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.840
but also a lot of
natural product drugs.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.040
So both nature and
chemistry have teamed up

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.700
to inhibit all of
these essential steps.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.610
OK, so how do you test
for antibiotic resistance?

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:26.660
You use plates where you're
growing particular strains

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.060
of bacteria on a plate.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.090
This would be a colony.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.130
And it's growing outwards.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.160
Where there is a colony but
there is no growth around it,

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.770
it means there is something
in that plate that

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.300
is inhibiting bacterial growth.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.900
So these are very
clear types of ways

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.450
that people check
to see if bacteria

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.670
have become resistant to drugs.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.860
You would look for that
zone of inhibition.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.010
Does it disappear with some
of the resistant strains,

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.870
for example?

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.510
And these get
pretty sophisticated

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.590
now where you can test a
bunch of antibiotics in one

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.440
go, where each of
these colored dots

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.900
represents an area
where there is treatment

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.720
with one antibiotic or another.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.320
So what's the problem?

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.710
The problem is this
graph, that as soon

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.790
as an antibiotic is introduced,
just a few years go by.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.490
And there is resistance
to that antibiotic.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:27.230
So resistance basically
is the gradual acquisition

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.200
of machinery to
somehow inactivate

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.710
the antibiotic treatment.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.400
So if you take a
look, here on the top

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.610
is where the drug is introduced.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.450
And on the bottom is when
resistance was developed.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.730
So let's go to something
we're familiar.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.440
Here is penicillin, people
introduced about 1940

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.180
to the general population.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.590
By about '47, there was
resistance to penicillin.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:55.880
And you can see, this is really
just a really serious sort

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.320
of series of events.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.500
So what I want to show you
was resistance in action.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.360
And that'll be the last
thing I talk about today,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.620
because I just want to
give you a feel for what

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.165
does resistance look like.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.780
So this was an
experiment that was

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:22.980
done at Harvard on just a
visualization of resistance

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.690
development.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.780
I think what's so
fascinating is you could then

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.030
go back to the plate and
pluck the first pioneers who

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.820
crossed that line and
find out what that was.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.780
What was that mutation that
let the population expand,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.300
and so on?

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.460
So you could really map out the
entire evolution of very, very

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.090
strong resistance.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:47.820
So in the next class,
I'll talk to you

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.510
about resistance mechanisms.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.460
And then we'll talk about
viruses and resistance

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.790
to antivirals.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, today we're going to talk about,
we've talked about primary

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
productivity on a global scale last
time.  And today,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we're going to talk about what
regulates that productivity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In other words, last time we just
talked about on average the amount

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of carbon and biomass that was
distributed among the ecosystems

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of the globe.
And we talked about deficiencies of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
transfer of that biomass through
food webs, etc.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
By the way, the one universal thing
that everybody seems to like are the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
DVDs at the end of the class,
which is good.  Unfortunately,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in today's class we are not going to
have one.  So you have something to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
look forward to on Wednesday.
I'll show you one at the end that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is really one of the cooler ones of
the collection.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It has nothing to do with the
lecture but I'm going to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
show it to you anyway.
OK, so today we are going to talk

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
about what regulates the
productivity.  We've talked about

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
these complex systems in ecology,
and the feedback mechanisms.  So, in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the context of productivity we're
going to talk about the factors,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the abiotic factors, to the
non-living parts of the Earth,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that regulate this productivity and
how the productivity feeds back on

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
those.  And then Wednesday,
we're going to put it all together

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in an analysis of global
biogeochemical cycles,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
how the elements in the globe cycle,
and how that's mediated by organisms.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And then, that will be the end of
the segment.  And when I come back,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we're going to move on to population
and community ecology,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
which will feel like a totally
different subject to you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, we'll talk more about organisms.
And some of you said it was so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
interesting to see math last time in
the last lecture even if they were

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just efficiencies.
Well, when you get to population

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
ecology, you're going to have real
math and you'll actually have

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
differential equations.
So, if you like that you have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
something to look forward to.
If you don't like it, well, it's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
not too bad.  OK,
so today the lecture will be in two

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
halves.  We'll talk about
terrestrial productivity,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then aquatic productivity and
what regulates it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And, can you see in the back or do
I need to turn,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm going to have to turn the lights
down, never mind.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, because we have some colored
images, so let's start with

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
terrestrial productivity.
And look at this map, oops,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
wrong ones.  I think that might be
enough to see it,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which is a satellite image.
You've seen several of these so far.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So just showing the gradients of
productivity on a global scale,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
where we're just looking at the land
now.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Where it's green,
you have high levels of productivity.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
These are grams carbon per meter
squared per year.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Yellow is intermediate,
and red is very low levels of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
productivity.  So,
what determines this distribution of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
productivity in terrestrial
ecosystems?  Well,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:39.000
got any ideas?  This is not hard.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What's a key factor in regulating
plant growth on land?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Light, absolutely.  That's a given.
But looking at this map, what's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
probably more important?
Water, exactly.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If we plot on a global scale,
if we go around to all these

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
ecosystems, and we look at the
average annual rainfall and we plot

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
it against net primary productivity,
you all know what NPP is right, net

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
primary productivity,
you get a graph that look something

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
like this.  Each one of these dots
would be an ecosystem.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And this one is millimeters rain
per year.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So, despite the Sahara Desert,
and this might be a tropical rain

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
forest.  And they scatter,
but there's some sort of general

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
relationship like that,
increasing NPP with increasing

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
rainfall.  Well,
what else is probably important?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
What else is different between the
Sahara Desert and the northern

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
US?  Temperature.
Exactly, which is not a good example

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
for comparison.
Let's take tropical rain forests

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and the northern US.
How's that?  But you get something

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
like this.  In other words,
it doesn't always map directly onto

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
temperature alone.
But on average, you find that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
places with higher temperature have
higher productivity if there's

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
adequate water.
So, does a relationship,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
there's an interaction between the
water and the temperature.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So, those are the key factors for
terrestrial ecosystems.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Now, what we have, so there's light,
nutrients, I mean light,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
rain, and temperature, rainfall.
What about nutrients?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Anybody who's had plants and their
room, or nurtured our garden knows

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that nutrients are very important.
You have to fertilize in order to

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
get the most growth.
So, how does that work?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Well, now we are going to do an
analysis of a terrestrial ecosystem.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We're going to use a tree.  Some
ecosystems you have,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that's a rock in case you didn't
recognize it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And we have soil.
These are components.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And, we've talked about this over,
and over, and over now.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Photosynthesis is the key,
taking up CO2, evolving oxygen,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we are going to call this
biosynthesis.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's the mass from gas.
So, that's CO2 plus, and now we're

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
going to add something.
And these are not balanced chemical

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
reactions, OK?
These are just to give you an idea

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
of what's going on.
So, CO2  plus, there's all the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
elements required for life,
OK?  In other words, for a plant to

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
grow, it doesn't only
need CO2 and water.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It needs all of these elements
required for life.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And they are converted to organic
forms of those elements.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And then oxygen is evolved.
So, we are in a general sense,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
just modifying the equation for
photosynthesis to include all of the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
elements that are required for life.
So that's the biosynthesis.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And then, the tree,
these are leaves in case you didn't

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
recognize them,
that are falling to the soil.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And the leaves fall down to the
soil and they become,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
what?  What's that organic manner?
You learn it last time.  It's the

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
whale falling to the bottom of the
ocean, and if that was a carcass,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the general term for dead, organic
matter is called detritus.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And there is a detritivore food web,
remember?  And we had some

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
discussion with students after class
whether we were detritivores,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
because in a sense we are because we
eat dead meat,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
right?  We don't eat live meat.
It doesn't matter.  You don't have

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to know that.  Forget that.
But it's interesting to think about.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So, the leaves fall down to the
soil.  They are acted upon by the

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
heterotrophic bacteria,
the bacteria that use organic carbon.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And, what happens is that those
bacteria and fungi,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and worms, and everything that chews
on organic matter are responsible

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
for regenerating these elements in
the soil.  So,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we are going to call that
regeneration.  And that's basically,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
simply the back reaction of this, OK?
So, you are starting

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
with organic carbon.
And, organic carbon,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
organic PNS, and it's converting it
back to the inorganic forms so that

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
they're available for the tree to
take up again.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So, this is the cycle of
biosynthesis regeneration,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and then take it up again.  Some of
the feedback I got on the lectures

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
when people said that they found it
interesting to think about how

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
everything in nature is
recycled and used.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Now, in some ecosystems,
there's another form of available

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
nutrients: calcium here,
you have cations, potassium from

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
rocks, magnesium.
All of these are also in this

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
equation.  When I go dot,
dot, dot, dot, it's every element

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that's required for life.
And in some ecosystems,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the [disillusion?] of these elements
from rocks is an important renewal

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
route for nutrients in the ecosystem,
OK?  So these are the two,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
basically in terrestrial ecosystems,
there is the rock source, and

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
there's the regeneration source.
And it turns out that different

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
terrestrial ecosystems have
different relative dependence on

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
these two sources.
And this is an interesting phenomena.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So, tropical rain forests,
like in the Amazon, these are the

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
forests that we're concerned about
losing for many reasons.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And these have, essentially,
no number one up here.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Tropical rain forests have
essentially no renewal nutrients

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
from bedrock.  And temperate forests,
however, have a combination of one

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and two.  They can have renewal.
The bedrock is exposed, and the

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
water cycle helps dissolve the rock,
and renews the nutrients to the

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:08.000
system.
So, if we look at the soil to

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:24.000
biomass ratio of phosphorus and
nitrogen in the temperate forests

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:40.000
versus the tropical, we see
something like this.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
In the tropical rain forests,
all of the nutrients in the system

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
are basically tied up in the biomass.
And it's highly dependent,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
then, on this regeneration cycle.
The trees fall down, it's

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
regenerated, it's taken up right
away from the soil whereas in the

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
temperate system,
you see the opposite where there's a

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
much higher proportion of nutrients
in the soil relative to

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the tropical system.
And what that means is that if you

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
cut down a tropical rain forest,
which they're doing, converting to

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
farmland, you will only get a few
years of productivity out of that

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
farmland because once you shut down
the forests and haul away the trees,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you've hauled away most of the
nutrients in that ecosystem that are

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
available to fuel productivity.
And they can't be renewed from

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
bedrock because they don't have
bedrock there.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So, that's one of the tragedies of
cutting down these forests when they

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
probably would have more economic
value by harvesting some of the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
natural products from
the forests.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
OK, so when we get to aquatic
productivity, we are going to see

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that we have these same biosynthesis
and regeneration processes.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So, that's what we're going to move
to now.  And let's look at the

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
distribution of aquatic productivity.
That's too much.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
A while.  Can you see that in the
back OK, the colors?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
All right.  So, now we're just
looking at the ocean's ecosystem.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And areas that are blue and green
are less productive than the areas

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that are red and yellow in the
system.  So you can see all of the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
coastal regions; we have coastal
upwelling that we're going to talk

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
about a lot with nutrients fueling
that, that is very important.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And on the whole north Atlantic here
we'll talk about that.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
But before we talk about what
regulates aquatic productivity,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
now I am going to turn the lights
out, I thought I'd give you a tour.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Since you all know trees look like
but you don't know what primary

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
producers in the ocean ecosystems
look like, I'm going to give you a

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
quick tour through the phytoplankton,
which as you know, are my

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
favorite organisms.
So, the aquatic productivity is

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
dominated by these microscopic
plants.  There are over 20,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
00 species, but we really have no
idea how many there are.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Wherever there's water, they exist.
They range from 0.5 to 1,000 µ in

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
diameter.  And as I told you in the
first lecture,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
there's as much genetic information
and a liter of seawater that

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
contains these primary producers and
all the bacteria but they live with

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
than there is in the human genome.
So here's some of my favorites.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
These are marine diatoms.  This is
a silicon shell.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
This is a single cell.
It's about 30 µ in diameter.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And this is made out of amorphous
silicon.  It's essentially opal.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And here's another one.  They come
in different shapes and sizes.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
They're just really incredibly
beautiful.  And people are just

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
starting to study what mechanisms
are responsible for laying down

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
these exquisite architectures.
Here's another one.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
To me this always remind me of the
Coliseum for some reason.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
These are pillbox shaped cells.
And they have two halves like that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And when they grow, when they
divide, one half lays down another

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
half inside of it.
Now, what's going to happen

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
ultimately if these are rigid?
They get smaller.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
One lineage gets smaller,
and smaller, and smaller.  Well,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
both of them get smaller, and
smaller.  And this group of

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
organisms has this really neat
system where when it gets really

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
tiny, they differentiate into egg
and sperm.  They made,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and that they make a giant cell
again.  And they start the whole

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
thing.  It's cool.
Just to show you some of the things

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
people have studied,
people have wondered why have they

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
evolved this very heavy armor?
And of course,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the first thing you think about is
resistance to predation.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
But there was never any evidence
for that.  And so,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I just found this recent study in
nature that shows where they

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
actually measured.
I thought MIT students look like

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
this because they actually measure
the force that it takes to crush one

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
of these cells.
Here's the study.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
There is a diatom [thrustule?
and they're putting a measured

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
force on it to see what
would crush it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And they were able to show that the
amount of force that it takes is

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
enough to have a selective advantage
against the crunching parts of the

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
zooplankton that eat them.
I also want to point out, this is

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
from the website of Dr.
Angela Belcher, who is a professor

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
here at MIT and material sciences.
And she is studying diatoms.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Here's a diatom.
She's studying them as a material,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
this amorphous silicon, looking at
the way it's laid down.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And she's also studying
coccolithophores,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
which is another group of my
favorite organisms.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
They have these calcium carbonate
plates.  Again,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
this is a single cell.
But it's cell wall is made up of

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
calcium carbonate plates.
And they come in all different

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
shapes and sizes.
Here's a really weird one with

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
these huge, they're called
coccoliths.  And these cells,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
this is a satellite image of
reflection, of light.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
In these cells, the calcium
carbonate, reflects light.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And this is a coccolithophore bloom
somewhere I think in the Bering Sea.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And we can measure these, but we
have no idea what causes a

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
particular species to bloom at a
particular point in time.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It's one of the challenges of
oceanography.  Here's another group

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
of organisms.  The cyanobacteria:
we've talked about them a little bit.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
These are prokaryotic cells that
can fix nitrogen.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
They're one of the few groups of
microbes that can take nitrogen gas

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
from the atmosphere and convert it
to ammonia, which draws

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
it in to the food web.
So you can actually see a bloom here.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
That one's called trichodesmium.
It grows out in the open Atlantic

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and Pacific.  Here's a bloom of
trichodesmium sucking nitrogen into

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
the ecosystem,
converting it into ammonia,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
making it available to the other
organisms.  Here's the organism we

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
work on, unfortunately very boring
looking, not as exciting looking at

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
the other ones.
And now, this is just under a light

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
microscope.  These are less than a
micron in diameter.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
But if you shine blue light on them,
they fluoresce red.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
The chlorophyll in them fluoresces
red.  And these are the smallest and

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
simplest photosynthetic cell.
They have 1,700 genes.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And with that,
I call them the essence of life

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
because with 1,
00 genes, they can convert CO2,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
nitrogen, phosphorus, all inorganic
compounds, basically this rock over

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
here, in sunlight into life.
And this happens to be like that

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
dominates the oceans.
They are the most abundant cell in

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
the oceans.  In some areas,
it's about 50% of the total

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
chlorophyll.  So,
they are basically a lean,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
mean photosynthesis machine,
and we're trying to understand

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
everything about it.
OK, does a digression,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
hopefully not a diversion.
So, what regulates aquatic primary

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
productivity?  Have to turn the
lights back on.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Before we get into that totally,
I want to draw a typical, what we

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
call a water column in
an aquatic ecosystem.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And I have seen this little red,
sticky thing here.  This is from

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
last year, and it says they don't
understand these axes.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
See, I remember from year to year.
So, if you don't understand

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
something and doing,
because I can tell when students

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
come up afterwards that I've
completely lost you.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
First of all, oceanographers plot
things upside down.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So this is depth.  So,
depth goes down, which makes sense,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
right?
And then, whatever we are plotting

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
against depth is on this axis.
So, in this graph I'm going to make,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
we are going to plot net primary
productivity, temperature,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
nutrients, a bunch of different
variables.  OK,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
and for oceans, this is about,
well, we'll just say 2,000 m, and

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
for lakes, say, 200 m
for a deep lake.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So, I'm drawing here sort of a
generic picture of a water column in

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000
either a lake or ocean.
OK, so do we have colored chalk?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Not here, OK.  Sometimes it used to
float around.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Well, you're going to have to use
your imagination.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
So first of all, let's plot light
as a function of depth.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
What does that look like?
Like that, exactly.  It's going to

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
decay exponentially.
In lakes, this is about 10 m,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and in oceans this is about 100 m.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Oh, and this was a question somebody
gave in the instant feedback.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Somebody said, I find it hard to
believe that all life in the oceans

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
disappears where there is no more
light.  And, you're absolutely right.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
It's only the photosynthetic life
that disappears when there's no more

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
light.  There's lots of life below
there that is using organic carbon.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So, if you're here, that the answer
to your question.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
OK, so then, now we're going to
plot temperature which looks

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
something like this.
And, this is what's called the

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[thermocline?].
And we can also think of this as

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
density.  Because colder water is
more dense than warmer water,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
right, you must have learned that,
did you learn that somewhere?  Did

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000
you learn that somewhere?
Where did you learn that?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Fourth grade, great,
well-prepared.  So, up on the

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
surface we have biosynthesis here
where there's light,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
and so it's exactly the same
reaction as we have over here.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And now it gets to the terrestrial
ecosystem.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
The production you have in the
surface water is you have

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
phytoplankton photosynthesizing,
making organic matter.  They're

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
being eaten by zooplankton,
by fish that are making feces,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
etc., that are being eaten by the
detritivores.  But the net effect of

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
this teeming food web they saw in
the DVD last time,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
is that there's going to be organic
carbon that falls down

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
below this lit zone.
OK, and that was the whale calling

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
out to make, no,
not purposefully,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
but telling down and making carbon
available to the food web in the

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
deep water.  So down here,
you have regeneration.  So this is

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
light.  And this is in the
dark in the system.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
But it's directly analogous to the
biosynthesis and regeneration system

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
there.  So the other thing we want
to plot on this is nutrients.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
They are drawn down to very low
levels in the surface water in the

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
lit layer because the phytoplankton
are sucking them up.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
They are nutrient limited.
They're sucking up the nitrogen,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
phosphorus, et cetera.
And then, as the carbon and all of

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
that range down to the deep water,
it's regenerated, and then the

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
nutrients are regenerated.
So that's why you see the gradient

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
of the low nutrients here and high
nutrients here,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
because the bacteria in the deep
water are breaking down the carbon

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
and releasing them.
OK, so if we look at this map,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
we can see that for aquatic
ecosystems, obviously water

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
is not limiting.
So water is an important regulator.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Light is a very important regulator
of productivity down to about in

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
this region.  And nutrients,
it turns out, are very important.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And it's nutrients that really
determine the tapestry of this map

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
that we're looking at.
And what I'm going to do for the

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000
rest of the class is explain it
lakes and oceans how the physical

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:53.000
forces make these nutrients
available in certain regions more

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000
than in other regions and explain
this.  OK, so first let's look at

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
lake ecosystems.
So, what we're showing here is a

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
year in the life of a temperate lake.
So this might be the Mystic Lakes

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
out in Arlington or something like
that.  Well, maybe that doesn't

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
freeze over, I don't know.
But anyway, a lake that freezes

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
over in the winter.
So let's start during the summer,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
and here's this basic graph showing
the thermocline,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
the nutrient depletion in the
surface, and this one indicates that

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
you actually have oxygen depletion
in the deep water because of all of

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
this organic matter from
productivity raining down and being

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
consumed by heterotrophic organisms
that consume oxygen.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
So, as fall comes,
and this is the important part,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
in the summertime, this layer is
mixed.  So, it's isothermal.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
In the fall, you have the winds and
the surface cools.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
And as this density gradient here
starts to break down,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
do the cooling in the winds.
And so, you have this mixing.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
It's called fall overturn, which
[then trains?] these nutrients from

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
the deep water into the surface.
So that's what way you get the

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
nutrients for the deep water back up
into the surface,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
whereas in the summertime,
the gradient is maintained because

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
of this density barrier,
and the mixing can't bring this down.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And then in the winter,
you have the ice cover that

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
obviously everything then is just
isothermal.  There's not much going

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
on, but there is some photosynthesis.
And then in the spring,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the surface waters start to warm up,
the ice melts, you have overturn,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
and brings the water up
from the deep water.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
In the ocean, in lakes,
this can mix all the way to the

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
bottom, OK?  In the oceans,
there's no force of nature that can

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
mix all the way down to 2,
00 m.  So you have this thermocline

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
in the oceans,
but it's in a relatively small

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
fraction of the total water column.
So the scale here is way off.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
We're going from 100 m down to 2,
00.  So in the ocean, it's just this

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
tiny little, all this action in the
surface.  So we need another

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
mechanism.  We can't mix all the way
down to the deep ocean.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So, we need another mechanism for
bringing nutrients to the surface.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And we're going to talk about,
there's four different ways.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:06.000
There's four different ways that the

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000
deep water nutrients are brought
back up where there is light,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
because you have to have liked for
photosynthesis to use the nutrients.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000
And one is episodic mixing.  I'm
just going to list them,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:35.000
and then we're going to go through
them: coastal upwelling --

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:45.000
-- equatorial upwelling,
and on much longer time scales,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:55.000
what's called the ìoceanic conveyor
beltî in quotes,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:05.000
which is basically local ocean
circulation.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So let's go through these.
In the oceans, episodic mixing,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
let's go back.  Now, just pretend
this is an ocean,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
and that this goes down to 2,
00 m, and there's a thermocline.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
What happens in the oceans is that
you just have little,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
episodic mixing events that you
wrote a great here to get little

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
bursts of nutrients injected
into the lit area.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
That's seasonal mixing,
but it never mixes all the way to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
the bottom.  And we can see,
I'll show you where, this right here

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
is the north Atlantic's bloom.
And in the springtime, you see

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
major bloom there due to this
episodic mixing in the North

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Atlantic, which have high winds and
a lot of mixing.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
OK, so there are also ocean currents
caused by this coastal upwelling

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
phenomenon, especially along the
western coasts of continents.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And I don't have time to go into
this.  You need a whole course and

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
physical oceanography to really
understand this  because it has to

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
do with the whole global ocean
circulation that causes this

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
upwelling along the coasts.
But, I'm going to show you how this

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
works in this movie,
or a little movie.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I guess that's as dark as we're
going to get.  This is a

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
cross-section of a coastal ocean.
So, here's the coastline.  Here's

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
the surface of the ocean.
And these little molecules here are

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
CO2.  Can you see blue?
This is probably not going to work

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
because of this filming.
Well, we'll see what happens.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
OK, so going to go through it in a
still, and then I'll show the movie.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
But what you're going to see is as
blue patch upwelling along the coast

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
here, in CO2 molecules are coming up
with it.  OK, here's the blue.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
That's nutrients, nitrogen,
phosphorus, etc.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
The wind is blowing offshore
causing the surface waters to move

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
in that direction.
They have to be replaced by

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
something, so we're bringing the
deep water up to replace that moving

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
surface water.
And as that comes up,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
the CO2 comes up and is released.
And then you have a phytoplankton

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
bloom from the nutrients,
and then the CO2 sucked back in

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
again and you have oxygen going out.
And, here it goes, the movie.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Upwelling: The Movie.
There comes the CO2.  Here are the

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
nutrients.  CO2 out, CO2 back in.
These are phytoplankton,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
this green blobs.  That's a bloom.
So you have now the phytoplankton

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
falling, big bloom,
organic carbon going down and being

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
regenerated.  So,
it's a very dynamic system and

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
that's why you have a lot of
high-intensity fisheries along the

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
coasts, especially the western coast
of continents because of this

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
upwelling; there's lots of nutrients,
lots of phytoplankton,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
lots of fish.
A dramatic example of the power of

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
the surface currents,
and how they affect upwelling is

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
this phenomenon called El NiÒo.
I think I'll skip the slide.  You

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.000
don't have it in hand out,
anyway.  But here's an animation

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000
showing the changes in the
productivity in the Pacific Ocean

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
along the equator.
Here's an El NiÒo.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And I'll explain how that works in
a minute.  Here's a normal year

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
where you have these phytoplankton
blooms, and let's look at it in this.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
You've seen this one before,
but let's look at it more closely.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
There's the equatorial bloom caused
by upwelling along the equator and

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
are normally year.
And as we go around,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
this is like three years in the life
of the globe.  See,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
there is high productivity at the
Amazon where the Amazon's empty.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Now, we are going to zoom in here,
and this is a normal year.  And

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
that's an El NiÒo year.
You see, there's very little

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
productivity, and is very little
upwelling along the coasts here.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
And that El NiÒo in Spanish,
what does it mean?  It refers to the

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Christ Child because this happens
around Christmastime roughly every

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
seven years.  And what happens in a
phenomenon is it turned out that

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
people have studied enough
for years.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
It's a global phenomenon in which
the prevailing currents in the whole

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Pacific Ocean shift from going in
this direction which causes the

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
upwelling here to going in this
direction, which brings warm water

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
suppressing the upwelling and
reducing the nutrient input into the

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
system.  OK, so here's an El NiÒo
year, and directly compared to

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
non-El NiÒo year.
And that's all due to physical

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
force is changing the
nutrient delivery.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So here's equatorial upwelling,
and then finally on a global scale,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
over very long periods of time, you
can imagine that these upwelling

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
events would not be enough to bring,
you have this constant rain of

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000
organic matter coming from
the surface waters.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And this nutrient reservoir in the
deep waters, none of these upwelling

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
events are enough to bring all that
back and renew the system.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So you need a bigger force than
that on a global scale over long

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
time periods.  And that's what's
called the great oceanic conveyor

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
belt.  And this is really important,
because I think people think of the

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
oceans as a static,
understandably, you look out there;

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
it looks like a bunch of water with
the surface waters and

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
with the deep waters.
And if you throw something in the

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
deep waters it's going to stay there
and you don't have to worry about it

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
anymore.  A lot of people want to
bury nuclear waste in the deep water.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And the point is that that's not
true.  The oceans are all

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
interconnected,
and if I'm a water molecule,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
the average amount of time, and I'm
traveling with the currents,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
over a thousand years, I will make
this whole journey where I go along

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
the surface waters and then I get to
the North Atlantic,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
and because the waters are cooled
and there's very high winds in the

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
North Atlantic,
you have cold water and of the high

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
winds cause high evaporation.
So you have saltier water,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
so, cold, saltier water up here
sinks.  And that actually is a force

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
that drives this whole global
circulation.  And so,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
I'm cruising along here.
I get here, and I sink.  And then I

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
go for this long journey down the
bottom.  And of course,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
it's much more complicated.
This is grossly oversimplified.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
But I go this long journey to the
bottom of the Atlantic in these deep

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
ocean currents,
and then somewhere along the line,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
I get brought up again through zones
of upwelling here,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
or maybe I would meander up here and
get brought up again.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[I'm just one atom on average?
.  So, through these global ocean

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
currents, the deep water eventually
comes up to the surface,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
bringing those nutrients back.
Where it comes in contact with the

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
light and the phytoplankton,
and they photosynthesize and they

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
take up the nutrients and they make
organic carbonate,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
and it all settles down again to the
bottom.  So, it's a cycle.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And if you didn't have that,
the thing would run down.  If you

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
didn't have the deep water coming up
eventually coming up somewhere,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
the system would just run down and
you do have a big anoxic bottom of

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
the ocean.  And who knows what would
happen?  So, this is

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
really important.
OK, so finally,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
I've talked about nutrients just in
general, what nutrients are the most

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:18.000
important?  And,
it turns out that there are some

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000
nutrients that are in much less
supply that are required by the

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000
plants.  And this is what's called,
so, what nutrients are important?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Now, of course,
they're all important but some are

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
more important in regulation than
others.  And there's something

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000
called the law of the minimum.
And it states that the growth of a

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:10.000
plant will be limited --
-- by that element that is in least

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:24.000
supply relative,
this is the important part,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:38.000
to the requirements of the plant or
the phytoplankton.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
When I say plant,
it could be phytoplankton or a tree,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
or a plant, or whatever.  And this
is the important part.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
So how we figure out what the
requirements for elements are above

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
plants?  You might grab it,
harvested, grind it up, and measure

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
the ratio of the elements
in that plant.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So, for example,
if you do that, for most plants you

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000
get something on the order of,
at least for most phytoplankton,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
which are my  preferred plant, you
get the ratio of carbon,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
nitrogen, and phosphorus,
of 106 atoms of carbon [for?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
16 nitrogen per one of phosphorus.
So this tells you in what ratio they

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:41.000
need these elements in order to grow.
So then you look in the environment

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.000
and you ask, what are the ratios
available?  So,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
say if the water has a ratio of,
what's going to be the most living

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000
element in that system
for that plant?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Exactly, nitrogen.
And, alternatively,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
you could have something like this.
And what would be limiting there?

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Phosphorus limits.
And it turns out that in most

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
aquatic ecosystems,
for now we're going to say that

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
nitrogen and phosphorus are the
important limiting factors.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And just to show you,
again, that ecologists do

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
experiments, here's an experimental
lakes area in Ontario,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
where there are 22 different lakes
set aside for research.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And in this particular set of lakes,
this is a control lake,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
and this is the experimental lake.
They added phosphorus to the lake.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And you can see the phytoplankton

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
bloom by only adding phosphorus.
They didn't add anything else.  And

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
that means that phosphorus was in
least supply relative to the other

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
nutrients.  And the interesting
thing that happened here was that

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
when they added the phosphorus,
that makes phosphorus in great

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
abundance relative to nitrogen.
And what that did is make nitrogen

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
the limiting factor.
And when nitrogen is the limiting

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
factor, what organisms might
have an advantage?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
We talked about them.
Yeah, there you go, nitrogen fixing

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
organisms.  So,
if nitrogen is limiting,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
only organisms that can take it from
the atmosphere can get more nitrogen

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
than the other organisms.
So they are favored.  And what

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
happens is you fertilize with
phosphorus.  You get blooms of

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
nitrogen fixing organisms.
It's really an interesting

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
phenomenon.
But nitrogen and phosphorus are,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
one or the other is limiting in
lakes.  And in large areas of the

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
oceans, nitrogen and phosphorus are
also limiting,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
except we've learned recently that
there are areas of the oceans where

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
iron is actually a limiting factor.
And this was an experiment that was

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
done by oceanographers.
And there is Alaska just to get you

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
oriented.  This is the North Pacific
where they went out with a boat and

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
they made it a patch.
They added iron just to a patch of

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
ocean.
And I can tell you about this.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
We were involved in some of these
experiments.  It started out with a

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
10 km x 10 km patch and showed that
if you add iron you get a bloom of

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
phytoplankton.
And this is a satellite image of

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
that phytoplankton bloom.
And in the last lecture, I'm going

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
to tell you all about those iron
fertilization experiments,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
and the implications for how we are
going to use the oceans

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
in the future.
So, take-home messages: we'll talk

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
about that next time.
You can take them home,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
but I don't want to keep you over.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.110
Now that we've described the
displacement of our object--

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.560
remember that our displacement
vector delta r in this time

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.150
interval was x(t) plus
t minus x(t) i hat,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.120
which we denoted
as delta x i hat.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.190
Now, let's just remind ourselves
that this distance here, that's

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.210
delta x, and this whole
distance from here

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
over to there-- that's what
we mean by x(t) plus delta t.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.530
And now what we'd
like to do is describe

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.157
what we call average velocity.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.160
And our average velocity
depends on our time intervals.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.140
So this is for the
time interval t

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.090
to t plus delta t
while the person has

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.620
displaced a certain
amount of vector delta r.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.560
And our definition
for v average--

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.300
it's a vector quantity,
so we'll write v average--

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.560
will use three bars to
indicate a definition.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.780
It is the displacement during
a time interval delta t.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.300
So, as a vector, we have
delta x over delta t i hat.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.330
And this component here is
what we call the component

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.200
of the average velocity.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.726
So this is the component
of the average velocity.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.530
And, again as before,
this component

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.470
can be positive, zero,
or negative depending

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.740
on the sine of delta x.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.229
And the key point here
is that average velocity

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.700
depends on whatever time
interval you're referring to.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.230
So that's our definition
of average velocity.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.440
And now what we want
to do is consider

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.710
what happens in the limit
as delta t becomes smaller

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.169
and smaller and smaller.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.910
And that will enable us
to introduce our concept

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.368
of instantaneous velocity.

WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
All right.
Good morning all.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today we embark on another new
chapter in what we do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the topic is going to be --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We will talk about this thing
called an Operational Amplifier.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Before I get into the lecture,
I want to point out a couple of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
things.
One is that you are going to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
hear about two big words in
today's lecture.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Two big and incredibly
important words.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And I want to mention those
words to you right now so that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
when I come to them in lecture
you can say OK,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I better pay really close
attention, these are important

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
words.
All right.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
One of them is abstraction.
The second one is feedback.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Two incredibly important
concepts.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Abstraction,
you have been seeing a couple

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
times during this course,
once in the beginning where we

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
abstracted out Maxwell's
equations by focusing on a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
smaller playground and simply
using KVL, KCL in place of those

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
equations.
A big abstraction.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It turns out that almost all of
EECS is based upon abstractions

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
at various levels.
In the first lecture,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I also showed you the layer
upon layer of abstraction that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we built to be able to build
interesting systems.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The second big thing is
feedback.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I am going to relate this
to anti-lock breaks in cars.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And so, you can wait and see
how we do that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's an incredibly important
concept.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Before we dive into the
amplifier abstraction,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
let me first talk about
something that you know.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Start with something that you
know and then lead up into the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
operational amplifier and its
circuits.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You know about the MOSFET
amplifier.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The MOSFET amplifier that you
know about looked like this.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It was based on a MOSFET.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There was a VS supply.
There was a vI input,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
a vO output and,
as I said, a VS supply.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So, this was a MOSFET circuit
that you've seen before.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
One way of viewing this is that
this circuit has three major

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
ports.
This here is the input port

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
with voltage vI.
This here, between the drain

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
terminal and the ground,
is the output port.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I take the output between the
drain terminal and ground.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And, finally,
we have a third port,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
which is this one.
It is called the power port.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I apply VS between this
terminal here and the ground

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
terminal.
And that gives us the power

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
port.
This device here was a three

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
port device.
Input port or control port,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
output port and a power port.
And so we looked at the circuit

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and did a whole bunch of
analyses of it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Then what I can do at this
point, now that you've seen

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this, it's often times
interesting to think about

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
abstracting this out into some
kind of a building block.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Much like in software,
you write a procedure and you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
abstract out the internal
details of the procedure in the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
procedure declaration and in the
call that you make.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In the same way,
we can take this little device

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
here and abstract that out into
the following abstraction.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We could abstract that out as a
device that looks like this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I have my input port,
I have my output port and I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
have my power port.
So, I can apply VS here.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Notice that I've taken these
six terminals here,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
one, two, three,
four, five and six,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and put a box around it.
And just exposed the terminals

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to you.
And I need to tell you a little

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
bit more about the internal
properties, but suffice it to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
say that you can begin working
with this little block.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
An even simpler version of this
for many applications might just

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
look like this,
vI and vO where there is a

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
ground that is shared among them
that is implicit in this

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
picture.
And vI and vO can simply be the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
node voltages at these nodes.
This is a progressively more

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
abstract representation of this
amplifier.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
What we can do is,
provided we know,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we can abstract out the
relevant properties of this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
block and expose them outside.
And the relevant properties

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
might well be that,
let's say here the properties

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
may be that I in is always zero.
I can also express to you the

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
gain of this amplifier.
I may also be able to tell you

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the Thevenin equivalent for the
output.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
There are some properties that
I can give you that will let you

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
use this building block
abstractly.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Today, what we will do is
introduce a powerful abstraction

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of a type of amplifier.
This is called the operational

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
amplifier or "op amp" for short.
What I am going to do is give

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you a slightly more involved
building block than the one I

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
have shown you there.
But suffice it to say that the

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
idea is going to be the same.
This building block looks like

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
this.
This building block has an

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
input port.
This building block also has a

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
port in which to connect power
or the power port.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And the way I am going to
connect power,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I am going to connect a plus VS
supply here.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
That is going to be my ground
node.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And I am going to connect a
minus VS supply to this node

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
here.
So, these voltages are both VS.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I want to apply a plus VS here
and a negative VS out here.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And I am going to take the
output between the ground node

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and the output node of the
operational amplifier and call

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that a vO.
This is the output port.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So, input port and output port
and a power port.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Think of this as a pattern
where I have an input port

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
across which I connect the
input.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I have a power port across
which I connect a plus VS,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
minus VS supply,
and then I take the output

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
terminal and take a ground
terminal, which is defined by

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
external components of my
circuitry, and use this as my

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
reference node.
Remember ground is just a

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
reference node.
I am going to use this as a

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
reference node.
These two are equal in

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
magnitude.
And take this as my output.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And when I do something like
this, I can build an even

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
simpler, so this is an abstract
differential input amplifier.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
In other words,
this amplifier is going to

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
amplify whatever I apply at the
input.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
A slightly more abstract
representation of this looks

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
like this.
vOUT and plus/minus vIN.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
This is a slightly more
abstract representation where,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
remember, we are going to draw
this again and again,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
maybe at least 38 or 39 times
in this course.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And, remember,
each time you draw it,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
remember that there is an
implicit power port,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
a plus/minus supply that is
connected which we don't show.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I remember when I first
learned about it a long time ago

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
there was a confusion in me
initially.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
How does this work?
Where is the power coming from?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Just remember that power comes
from a plus/minus supply,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and we just don't show that in
this abstraction.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Now, the details,
a lot of details are in Chapter

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
16 of your course notes.
That's the reading for that.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The other thing is that there
are some other key properties of

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
this amplifier.
And let me discuss those very

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
quickly.
First of all,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I can draw a circuit model for
the amplifier.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Make some room for myself here.
And this is a circuit model for

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
what we call the ideal
operational amplifier.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And the circuit model is going
to look like this.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is an abstract device.
And, in terms of analyzing how

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
this behaves in a circuit,
I am going to show you this

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
abstract circuit that looks as
follows.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Some input v is applied at
these two terminals here.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And this terminal is called my
v plus terminal and this is

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
called my v minus terminal,
so this corresponds to these

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
two terminals.
I am telling you that the

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
current going in is going to be
zero, so i plus is going to be

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
zero and i minus is going to be
zero.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
i plus is the current in here
and i minus is the current into

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
the v minus terminal,
and both these currents are

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
going to be zero in this device
here.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The output is going to look
like this.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Let me just call it vOUT to be
consistent with this here.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And taken with ground as my
reference.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The output is simply Av.
In other words,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
what I am doing is I am going
to model this as a device that

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
has a dependent source at its
output.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And the dependent source here
is a voltage controlled voltage

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
source.
It is a dependent source,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
it is a voltage controlled
voltage source such that the

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
output voltage is A times the
voltage v across its input.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This is actually very simple.
Think of these three terminals

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I have shown you here.
I applied input across these.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And the output is going to be A
times whatever I applied.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And A is going to tend towards
infinity.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
A is going to be huge.
And specific values for A might

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
be a hundred thousand or a
million or things of that sort.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Huge A in this abstract
amplifier.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
In addition to that,
the other properties are that

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it is going to have infinite
input resistance.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That means looking in this
looks like an open circuit.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The fact that this is open here
implies the infinite input

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
resistance across this port.
What about the output here?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Remember, this is a voltage
source.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And we have a zero output
resistance, which means that no

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
matter how the load affects
this, as I apply a load this is

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
going to behave like an ideal
voltage source and keep holding

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the voltage constant based on
whatever the function I

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
establish here.
And A is virtually infinite.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Let me pause there for a few
seconds and just dwell on this

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
so you just understand what the
basic device is.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Following this basic
definition, I am just going to

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
build a whole bunch of fun
little circuits.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The analysis will be pretty
straightforward,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
but this is a big conceptual
leap here where there is some

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
circuitry inside.
Containing resistors,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
MOSFETs, a whole bunch of stuff
in there.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I am not telling you what is
inside it.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Much like I could build an
abstract amplifier,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I could put an abstract box
around the amplifier you saw

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
earlier, I want to put a box
around some circuitry.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I am not telling you what the
circuitry is.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And, if you are curious,
you should look at page 581 of

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
your course notes.
There is an example solved.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
The example is for a
differential amplifier.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
This is the small signal
analysis chapter.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
That differential amplifier
that's solved in that example is

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
usually the first stage in an
operational amplifier circuit.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
That differential amplifier is
the first stage at the input.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And that differential
amplifier, as the name implies,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
amplifies not a single voltage
but amplifies a differential

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
voltage.
Note that this guy amplifies

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
the voltage difference between
these two terminals.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That's v here.
And v is simply the same as v

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
plus minus v minus.
It's the node voltage here

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
minus the node voltage here.
That is what's amplified.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It amplifies a difference.
Therefore, it is called a

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
difference amplifier or a
differential amplifier.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And so that input stage is what
is inside the op amp.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
It's got a bunch of other
circuitry like level shifters

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and so on.
And at the output it has got a

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
buffer.
At at the output it has

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
something that is reminiscent of
the source follower circuit that

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
you learned about in
recitations, solved an example

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
in the course notes and in your
homework as well.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And you solved a variant of the
source follower on your quiz as

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
well in problem two.
So, a circuit that looks like

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
that appears at the output.
Remember, for the source

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
follower, the resistance looking
in from the output was very,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
very small.
You have seen some of the

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
pieces that go inside the
amplifier, but we will deal with

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
this as a building block and
simply represent it using this

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
abstract little circuit.
To dwell on this a little

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
longer, this little device here
is the workhorse of the analog

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
industry.
Much like your primitive gate

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
abstraction, your inverter and
NAND gate and so on,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
much as your primitive inverter
or NAND gate was from the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
foundations of the digital
industry.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Remember we learned how to
build this little abstract

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
device called a NAND gate or an
inverter?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
We noticed that those form the
foundations of very complicated

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
microprocessors.
Those were the building blocks

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
of the digital industry.
In the same way,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
this little beast here is the
building block of the analog

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
industry.
Just to give you an analogy

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
from software,
think of this abstract little

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
device as a library routine from
a library of functions when you

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
program in C++ or whatever.
Can someone give me an example

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
of an incredibly popular routine
that we use all the time that

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
may be called the workhorse of
the software industry?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Pardon?
An abstraction,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
an abstract procedure.
One example might be something

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
like a printf.
Printf is an abstract name for

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
a procedure that goes and does
something for you.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
It is amazing how we take the
lowly printf for granted.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I stick my printf into my
program, it includes the

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
standard IO library and it goes
and prints a value.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
You won't believe how
complicated the printf is.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
As you go into learning more
advanced software subjects,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
implementing the printf is a
nightmare.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It is horrendously complicated.
Just imagine.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
You give it a string and it has
to go and print that on your

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
terminal or on your Windows
system or whatever.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Think of the complicated steps
it has to go through.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
But, as far as you're
concerned, it's simple.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Just print out something and
you're done.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
The same way.
Think of this as the printf of

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
the analog business.
It is really simple,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and the analysis is going to be
incredibly simple,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
it will be mind-bogglingly
simple, but inside it,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
heavens forbid if you look
inside it.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Tell you what,
go into to S-T-D-I-O dot in one

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
of the library routines and just
pore through printf.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
The world's worst horrendous
macros are in there.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I mean it is just nasty.
The same way inside the op amp,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
it is nasty.
You don't want to go there.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Much like in your C programming
in your classes,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
you were able to use printf
without fully knowing how it was

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
implemented.
Probably some MIT god or some

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
key graduate implemented it,
but once it was implemented you

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
just used it based on simple
abstract rules as to how it

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
behaved.
You didn't have to know what

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
was inside it to use it.
The same way with the

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
operational amplifier.
So, just think of printf when

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
you see this and just imagine
how simple it is going to be to

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
use it.
You may think that I spend way

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
too much time,
ten minutes dwelling on this

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
abstract concept,
but I like to dwell on things

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
that I think are incredibly
important.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
The concept of abstraction is
very important.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And it's not just in software.
The concept of abstraction

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
pervades all of EECS.
And if I were to give you a

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
project to say go and ask every
professor what is the one word

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that you think best describes
all of EECS?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Just pick one word.
Go ask every single professor

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
you know.
What is a single word?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
If you were to characterize all
of EECS with just one word,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
what might that word be?
In my mind, it is the A word,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
abstraction.
It is all over.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If you do a grep on all the
words used by all your

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
professors in your four years
here, I promise you the first

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
one will be know.
And the second one will be

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
abstraction.
Check it out.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
See if what I am saying is true
or not.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
It is all over the place.
In 6.001, how many times do you

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
think the word abstraction was
used in 6.001?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
It's all over the map.
It's the A word all over.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Imagine your shock when you see
it being used in 002 because the

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
same concept applies.
We build more complicated

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
systems by abstracting out the
details of lesser objects,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
and then using those to build
the more complicated systems.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Abstraction is a very powerful
mechanism of dealing with

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
complexity.
Next step is how do I go about

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
using the op amp?
Let me show you how it looks on

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
a scope.
What I am going to do is apply

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
input to the op amp,
I am going to look at the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
output, place the resistor RL to
ground and look at the output.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And here I am going to apply a
plus VS and out here a minus VS.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Again, remember that a plus VS
simply looks like this and a

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
minus VS simply looks like this.
It's just an inverted VS

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
applied here so I get a minus VS
at this input.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
First of all,
what I would like to do is as I

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
change vIN, I am going to plot
for you how vOUT looks.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
vIN and this is vO.
I am going to plot vIN in terms

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
of microvolts and vO in volts.
vIN is going to have a very

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
very small, the scale is going
to be in microvolts because

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
remember the gain of this is
huge.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
It's on the order of ten to the
sixth.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
It's huge.
Small changes in vIN are going

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
to cause massive changes in vO.
I have a very fine scale on the

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
X axis.
What is going to happen if I

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
somehow magically make vIN
exactly zero?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
If I short these two terminals,
if this was a completely ideal

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
op amp, which it never is,
if it's a completely ideal op

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
amp, then my output should be
zero.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
As I increase my vIN the output
should be A times vIN.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
For some small value of vIN,
small v, let's say one

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
microvolt, the output should be
one volt.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
A is a constant so this would
look like a straight line.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And let's say my supply
voltages are 12 volts minus 12

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
volts, if this were an ideal
amplifier and I didn't have to

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
worry about the supply,
this would just go on extending

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
forever.
But I have a plus 12 volt

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
supply and a minus 12 volt
supply.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
My output cannot go past those
limits.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And so, therefore,
my output kind of flattens out

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
at these two points.
And it is called hitting the

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
rails.
Output goes up and you hear a

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
thunk sound and you hit the
rails.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
When you play with op amps in
your next lab,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
if you listen really,
really carefully you may hear

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
it.
So, this saturates out.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Not surprisingly,
this region where the output

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
saturates at the supply is
called the saturation region.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Remember, don't confuse it
with-- It's not the same as your

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
saturation in the MOSFET.
It is a totally different

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
thing.
It is just happenstance that we

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
call this saturation.
And if you would like to think

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
about it, you can think of it as
the thunk region.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
That's probably more
appropriate to distinguish it

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
from the saturation region in
the MOSFET.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And, not surprisingly,
this one is called the active

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
region.
And it is in this region that

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
we use the op amp.
Here it has hit the rails and

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
is kind of dangling out there.
It's not much use to us.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
It's in this active region that
we use it because this is where

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
the gain is seen.
Now, it turns out that this is

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
a very high gain device.
It is very skittish.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
This gain is kind of a really
funny thing.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It's dependent on a bunch of
factors.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
This could be temperature
dependent.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
This gain here and this curve
is just completely skittish.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
It could depend on temperature.
It could depend on time of day.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
It could depend on what
medication this amplifier is on.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
It could depend on its mood
swings.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Who knows what?
This is kind of unstable.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And A in particular is highly
unstable.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
It is going to be big,
that's for sure,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
but it could be ten to the six,
on a rainy day it might be two

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
times ten to the six.
If it feeling sleepy it may be

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
point five times ten to the
sixth.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
It is big but I cannot rely on
it.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Let me show you an example.
I want to show you this curve

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
for this MOSFET,
apply an input and plotting the

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
output.
What I will do is take a look

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
at this curve.
Then what I am going to do is

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
use a heat gun to heat the op
amp and you are going to see

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
this vary all over the map.
If you still remember last

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
week, some of you may remember
that from some place in a

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
similar situation where the gm
for the MOSFETs you were given

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
was also dependent on
temperature and stuff like that.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
It is a very common occurrence.
And that is certainly the case

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
for the MOSFET.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Let's apply input.
Let's do this.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
This is vIN versus vOUT for the
amplifier.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Notice that this is plus 12
volts, this is minus 12 volts.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
It is about two volts per
division.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
This axis here is in
microvolts, I believe.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
For a very small change,
for a few tens of microvolts,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I have an incredibly high gain.
Notice that this has an

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
incredibly high gain here.
The gain is the slope of this

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
line, almost a vertical line.
What I am going to do next,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
is to have some fun,
is I am going to heat the op

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
amp.
To show you that A is kind of

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
really skittish and also the
fact that it doesn't quite hit

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
zero, it does all kinds of weird
things, I am going to heat the

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
op amp.
And then let's take a look at

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
how that curve fluctuates.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
What you saw there was that the
op amp began to behave really

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
weirdly as I heated it.
Instead of doing this it

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
sometimes did this really
weirdly, like getting an offset

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
from the center and so on.
And it does a bunch of other

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
weird things,
but we won't go into those

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
details.
It's not relevant for this

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
course.
But the point is that the gain

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000
and the offset at the input are
dependent on temperature.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And we look for ways to make it
less dependent on temperature.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
As the next step,
what I would like to do is

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
build a circuit.
This is model equivalent of

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
your Hello World program.
We are going to use the printf

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
and build a small program on the
printf.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
You don't have to worry about
how printf is implemented,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
just that we can build very
highly interesting circuits with

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
this horrendously complicated
function based on a simple

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
abstraction of the device.
The circuit that we will build

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
is called a noninverting
amplifier.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
From now on,
I am not going to show you the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
plus/minus VS.
I am not going to show the

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
power port, but it is in there.
It's hidden under the

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
abstraction layer.
This is my op amp.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And I am going to build the
following circuit.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
This is my v plus and this is
my v minus.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
What I am going to do is for
the v plus I shall apply a vIN.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Let me talk a little bit about
ground as well.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Ground is commonly taken as the
point at which I connect my VS

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
and minus VS supply.
It is kind of at the midpoint.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And if VS and minus VS are very
carefully tuned then the output

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
is also going to be at that same
ground reference when the input

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
is zero.
So, the ground is defined as

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
the point at which I connect my
plus/minus VS supplies.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I apply my vIN out here.
Then what I am going to do,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
here is my output vO.
I am going to have a resistive

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
divider to ground here and label
these R1 and R2.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And what I am going to do here
is feed this back to the input,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
to the v minus input.
I am going to sample the

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
voltage here and feed that into
here.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
So, this is my abstract model
and this is my Hello World

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
program.
What we are going to do is

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
simply analyze how this little
program behaves.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So, my equivalent circuit
model.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
The way to analyze these is
after one or two of these

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
examples, you will be able to
directly analyze this just by

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
looking at it,
by inspection.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
But, much as we did for the
other pieces,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
let me grunge through drawing
the equivalent circuit and

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
grinding through the analysis,
and then show you the much

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
simpler way of doing it.
And even here,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
even with this grinding
analysis, it is going to be

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
pretty simple in any case.
So, I will replace the op amp

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
with its equivalent circuit
model.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Its equivalent circuit was v
plus, v minus.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So, that was the equivalent
circuit model of the operational

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
amplifier, just this piece.
I draw that for you.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Then what I am going to do is I
connect my v in here.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
And, remember,
I have an R1,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
R2 resistive divider here.
And this one gets connected to

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
this terminal there.
I also know that i plus is

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
zero.
I also know that i minus is

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
zero.
All I've done is simply

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
replaced the amplifier with its
equivalent circuit.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Let's go ahead and analyze that
circuit now.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Let's go ahead and analyze that
circuit.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And it's going to be pretty
simple, actually.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
What I am going to show you is
the hard way of doing it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
I will show you a much easier
way, but the hard way itself is

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
pathetically easy.
What I want to do is find vO in

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
terms of vIN.
And there will be a bunch of

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
other factors thrown in,
including things like R1 and

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
R2, A and stuff like that.
Let's go and analyze it.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
vO, let's look at that circuit.
By the way, let me take 30

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
seconds and make a little speech
at this point.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
When you see circuits like
this, and I saw this happen in

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
quiz two as well,
for some reason,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
when you see a new kind of
circuit, don't completely go

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
berserk or freeze or whatever.
There is just no reason to.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
You know the node method.
The node method is the

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
workhorse of our business.
When in doubt apply the node

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
method.
It will simply work.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Don't freeze.
Don't think oh,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
man, I need to apply a pattern
that I know already.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I must have seen this
somewhere.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
When in doubt boom,
apply the node method.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
This circuit here,
all I have here is one unknown

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
node voltage.
I know the voltage of v plus,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I need to compute the voltage
vO.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
There are two unknowns,
vO is an unknown and the

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
voltage here at v minus is
another unknown.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
This is a very simple circuit
involving a dependent voltage

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
controlled voltage source,
and you need to find out vO and

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
v minus using the node method.
Just apply it.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
It's simple.
Don't freeze.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Just look at it and say I can
do it and apply the node method.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
It will simply work.
So, let's do that.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
What I can do here is vO is A
times v plus minus v minus.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
This is actually really simple.
And then, if I take v plus

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
here, I know v plus is simply
vIN so I will just make that

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
substitution right away.
So, v plus is simply vIN.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:10.000
What is v minus?
v minus here is vO --

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
What is v plus?
I'm sorry, v minus.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
v minus is simply the voltage
that is between R1 and R2.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Notice that no current flows in
to the v minus node.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
There is no current flowing in.
Voltage at v minus is simply

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
the voltage given by the
resistive divider,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
which is vO times R2 divided by
R1 plus R2.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Stare at that for another
second.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
The voltage at this node here
is simply given by the resistive

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
divider.
Because no current is flowing

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
in this direction.
And no current flows in because

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I am telling you there is no
current there based on my

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
abstraction.
I am telling you i minus is

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
zero.
That voltage is simply the

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
voltage at this resistive
divider.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
And so I can simplify it
further and write this as vO.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So I get, there is a one here.
And I move this thing over to

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
this side so I get one plus A
times R2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And that is equal to AvIN.
And simplifying it some more,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I get vO is AvIN divided by one
plus AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Notice how simple this is,
and this is the hard method.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
All I have done is analyze the
circuit using the basic circuit

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
analysis principle that you
learned the first week of the

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
course, and I have the output
for you.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I just noted very carefully
what the relationships were

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
between the various elements in
the abstraction.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Notice here that I am told that
A is extremely large.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
A is on the order of ten to the
six and so on.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And suppose it is the case
that, let me write that down

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
again.
vO is AvIN, one plus AR2,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
R2.
Suppose R1 and R2 are more or

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
less comparable and A is ten to
the six, it's a huge number,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
so this whole number is much,
much greater than one.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
If it is much huger than one,
what I can do is I can then

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
write this as follows.
I can say that this is more or

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
less equal to AvIN divided by
AR2 divided by R1 plus R2.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
I am ignoring the one here.
As soon as I do that,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000
notice I can cancel out A and I
get vO to be approximately equal

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
to vIN times R1 plus R2 divided
by R2.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Notice now that when the gain
is very large the output is a

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
function of the input multiplied
by some number.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
The beauty of this thing here
is that when A is very large,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
or this expression is very
large, A cancels out and there

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000
is no A in this relationship.
This means that even though the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
basic amplifier was very
skittish, the output here

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
relates to the input based on
components that I have control

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
over.
These are soldiers in my army.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I control them.
So, to give you a sense of some

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
numbers here,
suppose A was ten to the six.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And I choose R1 to be 9R.
And R to be some R.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Then vO is ten to the sixth vIN
divided by one plus ten to the

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
six R divided by 9R plus R.
So, that is ten to the six vIN

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000
divided by one plus ten to the
six divided by ten.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
All right.
If I ignore the one here,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
the ten to the six and ten to
the six cancel out,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
this ends up giving me 10vIN.
So, I get a really nice

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
amplifier whose output is simply
ten times the input and

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
determined solely by some
resistor values.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Let me show you another quick
demo this time and show you the

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
amplifier again,
but with resistors connected

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
like that.
And then I show you that I want

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
to heat the amplifier to the
wazoo, the op amp to the wazoo,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
but vO is going to be
absolutely rock solid.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Let's try that out.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
This time around,
this is the transfer function,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
the vO versus vIN.
And notice that this time

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
around I have similar scales on
the X and Y axes,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
and this has a slope of 10.
This is the point where the

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
amplifier saturates at plus 12
volts, and this is minus 12

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
volts, and this point here is a
zero.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
So, this is vIN,
vOUT, plus 12,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
minus 12 and this slope is 10.
What I am going to do now is

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
heat the op amp to the wazoo and
this ain't going to change

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
because it's my external
resistors that control it

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
independent of the value of A,
provided A continues to be very

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
large.
I am just articulating the

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
vOUT, vIN curve.
And let me start heating the op

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
amp.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Notice that it's pretty stable.
It doesn't change because it is

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
independent of the amplifier
values.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
What I have done now is by
connecting these resistors in

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
this way, I have a nice
amplifier with a gain of ten.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
The question you may ask
yourselves is why?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
There is this little sucker in
there that wants to shoot things

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
up by ten to the sixth.
Wants to knock things off the

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
one rail or the negative rail.
Why is it that it's behaving

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
like a docile lamb here and
giving us a nice little factor

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
of ten gain no matter what I do
to it?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Why is it doing that?
What is the intuition behind

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
it?
I will draw something on the

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
board, but for the next ten
seconds I want you think about

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
it.
See if you can come up with

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
some insight as to why is it
doing that.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Why is it exactly ten?
Why isn't the ten to the sixth

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
kind of killing me somehow?
Why am I getting exactly ten no

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
matter what happens?
See if you can come up with

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
some intuition and then I will
show you how it works.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
I will redraw the circuit in
the meantime.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Let me see if I can give you
some intuition.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
This is my circuit,
and let's say this is R and

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
this is R.
As an example,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
let's assume that the input is
5 volts, vIN is 5 volts.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
If R and R are equal,
what should the output be?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
It's R and R,
so it's R1 plus R2 divided by

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
R2, right?
It's 2R divided by R,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
so it has a gain of two.
My amplifier has a gain of two

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
because R1 plus R2 divided by
R2, which is my gain,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
is R plus R divided by R equals
two.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
So, this will be 10 volts.
If that is 10 volts this is

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
going to be 5 volts,
correct?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
This R and R,
voltage divider,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
this is five,
so I get 5 volts here.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
This is v plus.
This is v minus.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I get R and R,
5 volts here,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
that's how the circuit looks.
Now let's understand what is

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
going on.
And listen very carefully.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
This is going to be a key
insight that I hope you will

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
carry with you for the rest of
your lives.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
This is really,
really key.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
What you are going to see is,
I think, the third big ah-ha

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
moment in 6.002.
Like small signal analysis,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
like the frequency domain stuff
we saw, I think this is the

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
third big one in the next 30 or
40 seconds, things that are

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
completely either not
necessarily intuitive but are

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
just spectacular in terms of
what they can do for you.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Let's see.
Let's suppose that because I am

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
heating it, let's suppose that A
suddenly tends to increase.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
It wants to increase because I
have heated it.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
A is saying I want to get out
this mold here and starts to

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
break through its shackles here.
Let's say, as a Gedanken

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
experiment, that it tries to
shoot up this to 12 volts.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
It tries to push it up higher.
This is just a Gedanken

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
experiment.
The up arrow says that the

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
increase in A is trying to push
up vO momentarily.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Let's see what happens.
It is trying to push up vO

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
momentarily, so let's say this
goes to 12 hypothetically.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
If that goes to 12,
what should this volt node go

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
to?
Six, exactly.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
This goes to 6 volts.
If that goes to six,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
what does v minus go to?
6 volts again.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
So, v minus goes to 6 volts.
Now at the input I have 5 volts

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
at v plus and 6 volts at v
minus, so where should the

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
output go?
The output should go down

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
because the voltage of the
negative terminal is higher.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And so the output is A times v
plus minus v minus.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
And because this has gone down,
this has gone up here it is

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
going to try to pull the output
down.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
That is going to pull the
output down let's say to 9 volts

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000
or something.
Cachunk, there is a big battle

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
going on here.
A has gone up,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
it has boosted it up to 12,
but the moment that goes to 12,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
this goes to 6,
this goes to 6,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
and the op amp output has to go
down to 9 volts now because this

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
input is higher here.
If this goes to 9,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
this goes to 4.5.
If that goes to 4.5,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
this goes to 4.5.
What happens now?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
If this goes to 4.5,
what happens?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
It wants to go back up.
Can't it make up its mind?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
This guy wants to go back up
now because v plus is higher

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
than v minus.
What am I seeing here?

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
This whole circuit here behaves
like my little son,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
my 9-year-old.
If say do this,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
he wants to do the exact
opposite.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
So, there is a trick in how you
make them do things for you.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Look at this.
Because of this arrangement of

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
the circuit when A tries to push
the output up,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
the rest of the circuit tries
to pull it back down to where it

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
used to be.
If the circuit tries not to

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
follow the true path,
the rest of the circuit tries

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
to whack it into shape so it
follows a true path.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And what's happening is
because, in this arrangement,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
I have fed back a portion of
the output to the negative

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
input.
I have fed back some of the

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
output to the negative input.
And by providing this feedback

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
of a portion of the output to
the negative input,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I have arranged it in a way
that I have something called

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
negative feedback.
What negative feedback does is

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
that if this wanted to go wild
and crazy, the circuit provides

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
it with some negative feedback
like you just saw.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Feedback, a big word.
If you take a poll of all the

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
EECS faculty,
I suspect that feedback would

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
rank at least as the ninth or
tenth most important word in the

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
EECS.
If abstract is number one,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I think this would rank like a
nine or a ten or something.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
So, that's the reason why it
worked.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
In the last couple of minutes,
let me give you some insight,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
based on something that you
know, on how feedback works.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
This is a road here.
Let's look at anti lock breaks.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
This is my tire.
And let's say I have a set of

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
disk brakes here.
As the car is moving forward,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
if I apply the brakes the tire
stops rolling,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
but if I apply the breaks too
hard it can lock up the tire and

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
the whole car can skid.
The way anti lock breaks work

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
is as follows.
There is a controller that sits

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
here.
And there is a little person

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
looking at the wheel and seeing
is it turning.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
So, this is a feedback.
And it is saying is it turning?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Yes.
Or, is it not turning?

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
No.
All this person watching the

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
tire is doing is saying is it
turning or is it not turning.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
That is it.
That is a negative feedback.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
And so, if it is no and if it
is yes.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
If it is yes then what this
does is it applies the brakes

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
even more strongly.
It is turning so I can apply

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
more brakes.
But if it says oops,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
it stopped turning,
what it does is it simply

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
releases, the controller
releases the brakes.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And when the controller
releases the brakes this one

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
tends to loosen up a little bit
and the tire starts turning

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
again.
So, this way you are constantly

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
keeping the tire in its region
of critical friction so that it

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
is constantly moving.
And static friction applies to

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
how hard you can brake and it
doesn't start skidding.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
In fact, if you take your car
out, and I don't say you do

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
this.
Let's say go onto the Charles

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
River in the dead of winter and
you drive on the lake and you

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
slam your anti lock brakes on,
on an icy patch,

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000
you will notice that there is a
constant sound that looks like

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
something is vibrating in there.
That is exactly what is

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
happening.
Oops, the tire is locked.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Release the brakes.
The wheel is turning.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Jam the brakes on.
That is exactly what is

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
happening.
The same way as out there,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
you notice that oops,
the output is going up,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
pull it down,
oops, it's going down,

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
pull it up.
So, there is constant negative

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
feedback that is keeping the
output stable.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
A very important concept.
And I will ask your recitation

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
instructors to cover the very
simple method that is on page 9.

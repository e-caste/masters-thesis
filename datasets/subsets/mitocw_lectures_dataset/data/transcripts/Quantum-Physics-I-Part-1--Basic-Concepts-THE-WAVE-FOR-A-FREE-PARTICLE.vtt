00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.010
PROFESSOR: So what
are we trying to do?

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.020
We're going to try to
write a matter wave.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:17.129
We have a particle with
energy e and momentum p.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.720
e is equal to h bar omega.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.660
So you can get the
omega of the wave.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.930
And p is equal to h bar k.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.790
You can get the k of the wave.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.910
So de Broglie has told you
that's the way to do it.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.130
That's the p and the k.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
But what is the wave?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
Really need the phase to--
how does the wave look like?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.380
So the thing is that I'm
going to do an argument based

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.580
on superposition and very basic
ideas of probability to get--

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.350
to find the shape of the wave.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.080
And look at this possibility.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.580
Suppose we have plane waves--

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:12.550
plane waves in the
x plus direction.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.520
A particle that is moving
in the plus x direction.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
No need to be more general yet.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.670
So what could the wave be?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.380
Well, the wave could be
sine of kx minus omega t.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.020
Maybe that's the
de Broglie wave.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.160
Or maybe the de Broglie wave
is cosine of kx minus omega t.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.910
But maybe it's
neither one of them.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:58.180
Maybe it is an e to
ikx minus i omega t.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.960
These things move to the right.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.830
The minus sign is there.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:13.340
So with an always an e
to the minus i omega t.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.070
Or maybe it's the
other way around.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.570
It's e to the minus
ikx plus i omega t.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.550
So always an e to the i omega t.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.440
And then you have to change
the sine of the first term

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.290
in order to get a wave
that is moving that way.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.780
And now you say, how am I ever
going to know which one is it?

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.830
Maybe it's all of them, a
couple of them, none of them.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.420
That's we're going
to try to understand.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.920
So the argument is going to be
based on superposition and just

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.260
the rough idea that
somehow this has

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.630
to do with the existence
of particles having a wave.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.670
And it's very strange.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.650
In some sense, it's
very surprising.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.510
To me, it was very
surprising, this argument,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.260
when I first saw it.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.534
Because it almost seems
that there's no way

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:28.950
you're going to
be able to decide.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.120
These are all waves, so
what difference can it make?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.375
But you can decide.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.060
So my first argument
is going to be,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.440
it's all going to be
based on superposition.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.850
Use superposition-- --position.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.110
Plus a vague notion
of probability--

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.240
--bility.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.550
So I'm going to try to
produce with these waves

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.040
a state of a particle that has
equal probability to be moving

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.424
to the right or to the left.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.190
I'm going to try to
build a wave that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.710
has equal probability
of doing this thing.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:37.260
So in case 1, I would have to
put a sine of kx minus omega t.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.765
That's your wave that
is moving to the right.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.390
I have to change one sine here.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.770
Plus sine of kx.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.810
Say, plus omega t.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.020
And that would be a wave
that moves to the right.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.950
Just clearly, this is the
wave that moves to the left.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.130
And roughly speaking, by
having equal coefficients here,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.650
I get the sense
that this would be

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.270
the only way I could produce a
wave that has equal probability

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.649
to move to the left
and a particle that

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:22.440
moves to the right.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.680
On the other hand,
if I expand this

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.050
you get twice sine
of kx cosine omega t.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.970
The fact is that this
is not acceptable.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.620
Why it's not acceptable?

00:05:50.620 --> 00:06:05.080
Because this wave function
vanishes for all x at t

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:14.530
omega t equal to pi over
2, 3pi over 2, 5pi over 2.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.150
At all those times, the
wave is identically 0.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.110
The particle has disappeared.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.200
No probability of a particle.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.850
That's pretty bad.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.230
That can't be right.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.290
And suddenly, you've proven
something very surprising.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.260
This sort of wave just
can't be a matter particle.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.964
Again, in the way we're trying
to think of probabilities.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.730
Same argument for
2 for same reason.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.240
2-- So this is no good.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.930
No good.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.770
The wave function cannot
vanish everywhere at any time.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.915
If it vanished everywhere,
you have no particle.

00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:04.700
You have nothing.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.960
With 2, you can
do the same thing.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.310
You have a cosine
plus another cosine.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.790
Cosine omega t minus--

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:27.260
kx minus omega t plus
cosine of kx plus omega t.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:34.040
That would be 2 cosine
kx cosine omega t.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.110
It has the same problems.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.660
Let's do case number 3.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.010
Case number 3 is based
on the philosophy

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:55.000
that the wave that we have--
e to the ikx minus i omega t

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.250
always has an e to the
minus i omega t as a phase.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.370
So to get a wave that moves
in the opposite direction,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.220
we have to do minus
ikx minus i omega t.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.790
Because I cannot
change that phase.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.070
Always this [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:23.090
Now, in this case, we can
factor the time dependence.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:28.496
You have e to the ikx
e to the minus ikx

00:08:28.496 --> 00:08:31.488
e to the minus i omega t.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:41.230
And be left with 2 cosine
kx e to the minus i omega t.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.120
But that's not bad.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.620
This way function never
vanishes all over space.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.760
Because this is now a phase, and
this phase is always non-zero.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.780
The e to the minus i
omega t is never 0.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.970
The exponential of
something is never 0,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.390
unless that something
is real and negative.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.530
And a phase is never 0.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:21.530
So this function never
vanishes for all x--

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:27.110
vanishes for all x.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:34.230
So it can vanish at
some point for all time.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.160
But those would be points where
you don't find the particle.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.170
The function is nonzero
everywhere else.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.520
So this is good.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.060
Suddenly, this wave,
for some reason,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.130
is much better behaved than
these things for superposition.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.760
Let's do the other
wave, the wave number 4.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.250
And wave number 4 is
also not problematic.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:14.020
So case 4, you would do
an e to the minus ikx e

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:23.200
to the i omega t plus an e to
the ikx e to the i omega t.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.330
Always the same exponential.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:32.370
This is simply 2 cosine
of kx e to the i omega t.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.790
And it's also good.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.550
At least didn't get in trouble.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.340
We cannot prove it is
good at this point.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.950
We can only prove that you
are not getting in trouble.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:48.490
We are not capable of producing
a contradiction, so far.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.120
So actually, 3 and 4 are good.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.460
And the obvious question
that would come now

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.850
is whether you can
use both of them

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:06.790
or either one at the same time.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:13.160
So the next claim is that both
cannot be true at the same

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.360
time.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.000
You cannot use both of
them at the same time.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.710
So suppose 3 and 4 are good.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.470
Both 3 and 4--

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.150
and 4 are both good--

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.600
both right, even.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.670
Then remember that
superimposing a state to itself

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.490
doesn't change the state.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.260
So you can superimpose 3 and 4--

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.870
e to the ikx minus i omega t.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.010
That's 3.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.090
You can add to it 4, which
is e to the minus ikx--

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.825
minus omega t.

00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:04.240
I factor a sine.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.975
And that's 4.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.070
And that should still
represent this same particle

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.080
moving to the right.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:22.060
But this thing is twice
cosine of kx minus omega t.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.880
So it would mean
that this represents

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.620
a particle moving to the right.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.170
And we already know
that if this represents

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.140
a particle moving to the
right, you get in trouble.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.330
So now, we have to
make a decision.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.230
We have to choose one of them.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.460
And it's a matter of convention
to choose one of them,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.490
but happily, everybody
has chosen the same one.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.962
So we are led, finally,
to our matter wave.

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.170
We're going to make a choice.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.370
And here is the choice.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:12.350
Psi of x and t equal to
the ikx minus i omega t.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.800
The energy part will
always have a minus sign.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:35.750
Is the mother wave
or wave function

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:50.200
for a particle with p
equal hk and e equal h bar

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.350
omega according to de Broglie.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.650
You want to do 3
dimensions, no problem.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:07.520
You put e to the i k vector,
x vector, minus i omega t.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.790
On p, in this case,
is h bar k vector.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.970
So it's a plane wave
in 3 dimensions.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.600
So that's the beginning
of quantum mechanics.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.460
You have finally found
the wave corresponding

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.530
to a matter particle.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.900
And it will be a
deductive process

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.140
to figure out what
equation it satisfies,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.380
which will lead us to
the Schrodinger equation.

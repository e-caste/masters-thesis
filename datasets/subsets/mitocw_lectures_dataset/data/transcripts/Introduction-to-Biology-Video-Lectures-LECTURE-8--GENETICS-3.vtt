00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's dive in
today and look at

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how geneticists use genetics.
I've told you up until now about

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
some of the history of genetics
and how it gave rise to our

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
understandings about genetic
transmission in traits, about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
genetic mapping,
linkage analysis,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
how all this helped confirm
the Chromosomes Theory.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we wove in a number of concepts
about how scientific theories are

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
developed and data is interpreted
and intuitions are made,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then how they're actually proven,
what sort of evidence it takes to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
actually achieve
conscientious around theories.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And that often takes sometimes
years, many times decades before

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
full contentious is achieved around
things. Today I want to turn a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
little bit to the experimental uses
of genetics in a more day-to-day

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
fashion. And you will recall this
coat of arms that I put up here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Function. Gene.
Protein. Biochemistry.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Genetics. And I told you about how
these were two different ways to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
study biological function.
Today I want to talk a little bit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about how we use genetics
to study biological function.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, in particular, I'm going to
pick some examples of how we use

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
genetics to study biological
function that have to do with the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
biological functions
of biochemistry.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So already we're beginning to look
ahead to this connection between

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
gene and protein, which
molecular biology will

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
establish for us. So, suppose
you want to do genetics.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You've got to study some organism.
We talked already about Mendel's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
choice of organism, the pea.
We talked about some of its

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages you could get pure

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
breeding strains in the market,
you could, when you're done with the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
experiments, feed it to the other
monks. There were a lot of things

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
like that, that were
advantageous about the pea,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but it had problems of generation
time. You would only get,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
certainly in Europe, a generation or
so a year. In Northern Europe maybe

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
you could squeeze a second
generation in not so good.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Fruit flies, a very attractive
system in many respects because you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
could grow many,
much larger numbers.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The generation time is on the order
of two weeks or so to go from a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
fertilized fly embryo, a fly
egg developing into a fly,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
developing into a mature adult,
able itself to have offspring.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, very attractive. There are
other systems that people studied.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And, of course, one of the reasons
they study this system is because

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it's interesting, I'm sorry,
because it's tractable.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the other reason is
because it's interesting.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So, tractability is very
important to a geneticist, right?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The number of whale geneticists
is few, for the most part.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But we also want to choose our
system because of what it will tell

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
us about the system we want to
study. Like if you want to study

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
distinctive things about the immune
system, you might want to study them

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in mice, or if you could
even study them in people,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
although you can't set up crosses
in people. We'll come to that on

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Monday. If you wanted to study
things about basic aspects of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
development, you might
study them in fruit flies.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And if you wanted to study basic
biochemistry, the place to study

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
basic biochemistry might best be
done in single-celled organisms,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which also have to carry out
biochemical pathways like glycolysis

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and synthesis of amino
acids and things like that.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They're going to be, by far,
the most tractable systems.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And so, people are particularly
fond for doing things like studying

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
basic biochemistry and many other
aspects of basic molecular biology

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to studying the organism yeast.
Yeast is a friend of human beings.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Certainly, yeast has been an
intensely studied organism because

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of its practical benefits
in the making of bread,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in the making of beer.
So, fermentation processes,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
dough rising and all that. But
yeast also is a tremendously

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
important organism for the
geneticist. It is an extremely

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
elegant experimental
system. Yeast is a fungus.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It is a single-celled eukaryote.
That is true nucleus. It's got

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
chromosomes that pair up. It's
cells, through a first order

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
approximation, that are
an awful lot like your

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
cells in terms of having all of
the basic important eukaryotic

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
organelles in the nucleus,
mitochondria, other things like that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, yeast is a
great model for many

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
purposes. And we're not going to
talk much about the cell biology of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
yeast, but I do want to talk
about the husbandry of yeast,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
how it is that you grow yeast.
So, the way a geneticists grows

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
yeast is take growth medium
that has lots of rich nutrients.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You could take a broth with lots of
amino acids and all sorts of stuff,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you know, a little bit of
salt, lots of water of course.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And if you take a single yeast cell
and it's got lots and lots of rich

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
nutrients in this broth here,
you put your yeast cell into the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
broth, so I will do that.
Here's my flask, here's my little

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
rod which has a yeast cell or a
couple of yeast cells on the end of

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it. I put it in there and I grow
it at an appropriate temperature.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Let's say 30 degrees, for example,
would be a nice temperature.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I could do that if I wanted to.
Then a C obviously. I grow it up

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I get a culture of yeast in
there. And I can tell because this

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
nice clear broth is now all cloudy
with yeast that's grown up in it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now I want to study these guys, so
what I do is I pour them out onto a

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Petri plate. The Petri plate has
on it a medium, a solid medium,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
an agar medium that
again has nutrients.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And if I pour this out,
and I pour out a lot of it,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
what will happen? Well, there will
be yeast all over the place and it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
will be very smootsie. There
will be like yeast cells

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
everywhere and it's
not very organized. So,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
what I want to do is I want to
take that and I want to dilute it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I want to take only a little bit
of the broth and put a little bit of

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the broth on my plate. Maybe
I'll have diluted it first.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then I want to spread it
around with a little spreader,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
here's a little glass spreader maybe
or something, and push it back and

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
forth, so that really there are just
individual single cells scattered

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
randomly, scattered around.
And so, then this cell begins to

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
grow and divide and divide
and divide and I get a colony.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
A little hill of cells all of which
descend from a single cell that was

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
put into that position. And
the reason I know that they all

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
descend from a single cell is
because most of this plate does not

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have cells on it. Most
of the plate is sparse.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I've just got cells, cells, cells,
cells scattered about. And because

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
of that I know that these
had of been individual events.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These things are called colonies.
Now, when yeast grows and divides

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
like that, let's take a moment
and talk about its life cycle.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We'll introduce its life cycle
here. Yeast proper eukaryote,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
so it has a diploid stage. It
grows as a diploid. And it can

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
undergo mitosis in which all
of the chromosomes line up, as

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
we talked about. They've
already pre-replicated so

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that they'll be ready to divide up
and give one to each daughter cell,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and there you go. N for yeast is
16. Yeast happens to have 16 pairs of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
chromosomes. Peas had seven.
Humans have 23 pairs. Every

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
organism has its own yeast of
16. Now, what we do is we undergo

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
meiosis to make haploid cells,
sperm or eggs in the human

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
population. Yeast also
undergoes meiosis to make spores.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It sporulates and it produces
spores. And it turns out these

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
spores, of course as you would
expect, have N chromosomes.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They undergo meiosis just
as we drew it on the board.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And these can come in two flavors.
They happen to come not in male and

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
females, but A and alpha, there
you go. A and alpha cells can

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
mate together to produce,
again, a diploid. They fertilize

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and can produce a diploid. They
fuse to do that. And you now

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
get back to a diploid from your
haploid. So, this looks just

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
identical to the human genetic cycle
here, but there is one difference.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
What's the difference?
Sorry? Time. Yes,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
it's true. Yeast can divide
much more rapidly. Yeast can have

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
offspring extremely rapidly
over a course of a day or so.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And humans take somewhat
longer than that. They,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
for example, have to wait until
they get out of college to be able to

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
reproduce mostly. What
else? There's one other

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
important thing. It turns
out that yeast can also

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
undergo mitosis as a
haploid. In other words,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the haploid cells of yeast, when
it makes individual haploids,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
they can continue to grow
indefinitely. By contrast,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
your gametes cannot. You do not
have an independent human stage in

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which you are haploid, or
your gametes are haploid.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Whereas, yeast can hang out as a
haploid for a very long time until

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
it decides it wants to mate.
This is very convenient for

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
geneticists. Geneticists like this
because it means we can grow the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
thing as a diploid, we can
grow the thing as a haploid.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
When we want to mate them,
we can mate them together,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
but we can also study them alone.
And, you could imagine, this is

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
going to be really good for
studying recessive traits,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
right? So, that's one of the
reasons why geneticists are fond of

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
yeast. There are many reasons
geneticists are fond of yeast.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Just growing yeast, it
smells very nice in the lab.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000
For example, try growing E.
coli by comparison. So, now,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
it turns out that yeast is very
happy if you grow it on rich medium.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But yeast can grow on minimal
media with very few macro molecules.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It needs a carbon source which
is some sugar that it can ferment.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It needs a nitrogen. It needs
some simple source of nitrogen.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It needs some simple source of
nitrogen. It needs a source of

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
phosphorus. It needs some other
trace salts and things like that.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And obviously it needs some water.
That's it. If you think about

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
what's in a yeast cell, like
it's got phospholipid bilayers.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But you're not giving
it any phospholipids.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Why is it able to grow? It
makes them. What about proteins?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They're made up of 20 amino acids.
You're not giving it any amino

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
acids. Why? It makes them.
Yeast is extraordinarily

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
self-reliant. You, by contrast,
are not as self-reliant.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
There are a number of amino
acids which, if I don't give you,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
you can't live because you don't
actually have the ability to make

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
those amino acids. But yeast
is able to make the vast

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
majority of things. Basically,
you almost just needed

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to give it the elements. As
for carbon sources and things

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
like that, it's very happy with a
wide variety of fermentable sugars.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You can give it glucose.
You can give it sucrose.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You can give it galactose.
You can give it fructose and it

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
will deal. So, yeast
is very well set up

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
metabolically. So, it's
got all of these pathways

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
of the sort Bob has talked about for
being able to breakdown the things

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
you give it and being able to
synthesize up the things it needs.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Now, yeast, of course, is not
stupid. Because if you give it

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
amino acids it will use it. If
you give it all sorts of other

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
things it will use it. So,
yeast is able to use rich media

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that have lots of complex
nutrients and macromolecules.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So, it has an ability, it has
everything it needs to make

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
these things, but it has
an ability to regulate that.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So, the processes, the
enzymatic pathways that produce

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
complex macromolecules,
amino acids, phospholipids,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
et cetera, will be down regulated,
shut off, or at least decreased if

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
you provide it with
these macromolecules.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
That's an interesting question
of how it manages to regulate its

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
biochemistry. Why does it care?
Why doesn't it, why not just have

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
those pathways be on all the
time? Sorry? Waste of energy.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It needs ATP. It costs money.
So, at the beginning probably they

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
were on all the time,
but some yeast evolves,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
or some precursor to yeast
evolves that's able to regulate it.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
That one is able to be
more frugal with its energy.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It outgrows its other ones
and then another, dah, dah,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
dah. Any place you can make
a few ATPs here or there,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
eventually the organism that does
it will out compete the organism that

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
doesn't. And so, rather
fine control of this,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which is a topic we'll
come to in a couple of days,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
gene regulation and other
kinds of pathway regulation is

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
very important. OK. So,
we want to know how does it

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
do it? What are the enzymes?
What are the pathways? How does it

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
actually make,
oh, I don't know,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
arginine? How does it make arginine,
amino acid? How would you find out

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
how yeast makes arginine? How
can yeast synthesize arginines?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So, you remember our picture that
the biochemist wants to study a

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
problem by grinding up the cell
and purifying a component able to do

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
something. So, a biochemist
might want to grind up

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
the cell and purify an
enzyme that can make arginine.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Form what, of course, is
an interesting question?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And then the thing that made the
thing that was used to substrate,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
et cetera, et cetera.
What would a geneticist do?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
How does a geneticist approach
the problem with how does

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
yeast make arginine? Find
a yeast that cannot make it,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
that's what we do. That is.
So, what we need is a mutant.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
A geneticist wants a
yeast that cannot make it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
A geneticist wants mutants.
How do you find the mutant? You

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
find the mutant by
going on a mutant hunt.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That is what geneticists refer to it
as. And it's a very exciting thing.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
You go off, load up the guns and go
off into the bush on a mutant hunt.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And so, I want to talk about
the strategy for a mutant hunt.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
How do we look for a yeast
that can't make arginine?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Sorry? Cannot. I've got a
yeast that can make arginine,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
because normal wild type yeast
can grow on minimal media without

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
arginine supplied.
And, when I examine it,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
it's got arginine in it.
Yes? So, who should I find?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Proteins that contain arginine and
then it doesn't have the proteins

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that doesn't have arginine.
Interesting. Now, the problem is

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
almost all proteins will have an
arginine, or the vast majority of

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
them. And a yeast that lacked all
those proteins that didn't have

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
arginine would not be much
of a yeast. I think it would

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
be pretty dead. So, it's
a good thought if it was a

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
more dispensable function.
But that's going to be tough.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Or, maybe I can use the fact
that it's dead. Now in a sense,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
can I find the yeast? Yes?
You had a thought on this.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Yes? Kill all yeast that
make arginine, excellent.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So, if I had a chemical agent
that could kill yeast that can make

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
arginine, I could only get the yeast
that make it. How would I do that?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
That's a very interesting idea.
You're right. You could construct

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
the chemical molecule in the
arginine pathway which when it was

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
broken down enzymatically
made some toxic product,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and only those yeasts that couldn't
break it down would be able to grow,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
et cetera, et cetera, and I could
select. That's a very cleaver idea.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
But I'd also have to know an awful
lot about the pathway in advance.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So, suppose I didn't' know the
pathway. Suppose I knew nothing

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
about how arginine gets
made. Yes? Excellent. So,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I take, I mean geneticists are
simpleminded folks and they like

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
simple solutions. Take
medium in which you've given

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the yeast arginine, grow it
up, and then pour it out on

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
a plate that doesn't have arginine.
Everybody got this idea? So, we're

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
going to take yeast. We're
going to grow it up in medium

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
which contains arginine
with arginine. So,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
now yeasts, those mutants that arose
by chance that are unable to make

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
their own arginine are still able
to grow here. And then we dump it out

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
onto a plate that has minimal
media without arginine,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
no arginine, and those ones that can
grow up are the ones that we're not

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
interested in. And the
ones that don't appear are

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
the ones we're interested in.
But, wait a second, that's the

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
problem, isn't it,
because they're not here.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
How do we study them if they're not
there? What can we do about that?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Yes. You want to see if you can
help us. Remove the ones that grew

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
up. So, get in there,
scrap them off, now put some

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
arginine on. We're
getting to the idea.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Maybe we can set this up
more elegantly, though.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Thoughts? How can we, yes?
Make a bet? Make a guess?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I can make that guess,
but how do I find them?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Here's a simple,
simple, simple idea.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Let me try a simple idea. How
about I grow up these yeast,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
and instead of plating
them on minimal medium,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
let's be good to them. Let's
plate them on minimal medium.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Good. That's interesting. Let's
plate them on minimal medium

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
plus arginine. Or,
actually, if we wanted to,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
we could even plate them on rich
medium. We'll be really good to

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
them. Either way. So, now,
let's let each one grow up.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And here will be the ones that
can grow and the ones that can't

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
grow with arginine. Now
let me take a plate that is

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
minimal medium. And now
let me take a toothpick,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
put a little toothpick there and
carry over this colony to there.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Let me take a toothpick and
carry this guy over to here and a

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
toothpick and carry this
guy to here, and a toothpick,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
and a toothpick, and a toothpick.
And all I have to do is keep

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
transferring, one at
a time, these colonies.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And now I can see that somewhere
there was a colony that grew fine

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
when I gave it,
say, rich medium,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
or minimal plus arginine, and
a colony that didn't grow when I

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
put it on minimal medium.
That would at least show,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
so, of course, the issue is I first
have to find them by growing them on

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
something where I've given the
arginine and then I can see that

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
they can't grow. All
right. This is what

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
geneticists basically do. What
happens if I grew them on rich

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
medium and I transferred them
to minimal medium? Why might

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
something not grow? It might
be missing the ability to

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
make tryptophan. It might
be missing the ability to

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
make proline. It might be missing
the ability to make something else.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
So, what I can do is, if I wanted
to, make a very broad mutant hunt.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I could just first grow on rich
medium and then plate on minimal

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
medium and any yeast that has lost
the ability to make some essential

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
nutrient will be evident by its
absence on the minimal medium plate.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
So, we have for yeasts.
Yeasts that are able to grow on

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
minimal media are called prototrophs.
They are the wild type that can

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
grow on minimal media. They
can make everything themselves.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Yeasts that need help, that
cannot grow by themselves,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
that need help, that need a
supplement are called auxotrophs.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Auxo obviously meaning help. So,
it's a mutant that has lost the

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
ability to grow on minimal medium
and that it needs a supplement of

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
some kind. So, if I wanted
to, I could just first

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
collect lots and lots and lots of
auxotrophs and then figure out what

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
they need. So, I might
collect a large collection

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
of auxotrophs. And then
test to see if supplying

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
arginine rescues them. I
could also test tryptophan.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So, if I only, only, only cared
about finding arginine auxotrophs,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
I could just grow them on
minimal plus arginine and then

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
test them on minimal. And
then I would know in advance,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
these guys all grew with arginine
on minimal and didn't grow without

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
arginine, and I'd know
it was arginine. Or,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
if I was in an expansive mood,
I could test them on rich medium,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
collect everybody who's
unable to grow on minimal,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
and then work out what the
reason is. Is it arginine?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Is it proline? Is it whatever?
And it depends how much work you're

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
interested in doing and how
complete the study is you want to do.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Either way, we could end up with a
collection of arginine auxotrophs.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Organisms that are mutant for the
ability to make their own arginine

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
and require it to be supplied
to them in the medium.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
All right. I might get,
depending on how much work I'm

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
willing to do, dozens
of independent colonies

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
unable to grow without arginine.
I might get hundreds if I'm willing

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
to do enough work. I can
get as many as I want.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Our goal now is to study them and
find out why they're unable to do

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000
that. I have a quick question?
Those yeast cells we plated, where

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000
they haploid or diploid?
We didn't say, did we? So,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
should they be haploid or
diploid? How many vote diploid?

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
How many vote haploid? A lot
of people vote haploid but

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
aren't willing to express
a reason why. Why haploid?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Right. Excellent. Excellent,
although genes are not

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
recessive, but OK. A little
detail. Phenotypes are

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
recessive. Tell me a
little more of what you're

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
thinking about. We'll
have it out later on this

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
point, yes. So, suppose we
were looking in a haploid.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I take your point, even if
on nomenclature I want to

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
push back a bit. So,
suppose it's a diploid and

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
suppose we have now two
copies of this chromosome here

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
in the diploid. And suppose
there's a gene over here

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
that encodes an enzyme that we
now is necessary to make arginine,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
or that somebody knows is
necessary to make arginine.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Let's image that that's the case.
In order to get haploid yeast that

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
is unable to make arginine
due to a mutation in this gene,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
you need to have some kind
of a mutation in this copy.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
What about in the diploid yeast?
In order to make this yeast unable

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
to grow without arginine, do we
need a mutation in both copies?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Well, the answer is probably.
The truth is actually a bit more

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
complicated, but let's suppose it
was the case that even one copy of

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
the functional gene was sufficient
to carry out the enzymatic step,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
then the answer would be yeah,
we'd need a mutation of both copies.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
What's the chance of finding a
yeast that has a mutation in both

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
copies? It's obviously much less
than the chance of finding a yeast

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
that had a mutation of one
copy. So, we're much better to go

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
searching in the haploid where the
phenotype will be revealed much more

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
easily by virtue of just the single
mutation rather than having to,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
by chance, encounter one that
had mutations in both copies.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Now, the reason I'm a little
bit cautious here is because

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
notwithstanding the textbooks,
it's not always the case that

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
everything like this is a
recessive trait. It's possible that

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
auxotrophy for arginine
could be a dominant trait.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So, how could that be?
Well, auxotrophy could be a

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
recessive trait. Suppose
there's some enzymatic

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
pathway, A goes to B goes to C goes
to D, and this encodes an enzyme

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
that carries out a
particular biochemical step.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Well, if the gene is broken, if
the gene is missing, if the gene

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
doesn't make the protein, as
you guys all know that that's

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
what happens, then you don't have
the enzyme, you can't do the pathway.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And it is usually the case that
having just one copy is sufficient.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Because having a little bit of
enzyme the pathway may work slower

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
but it will still work just fine and
you'll eventually get arginine made.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
But it's occasionally possible,
I note since you guys are

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
sophisticated, that
sometimes a gene can encode a

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
protein which not only doesn't
work but screws up the other working

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
copies of the protein. Suppose
the enzyme that did this

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
were a tetramer. It had
several subunits that had

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
come together. A mutant
copy of an enzyme,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
when it forms into a tetramer,
might somehow disrupt all the other

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
good copies that are around.
And that does happen sometimes.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
It can happen that you're going to
have an inability to make your own

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
arginine be a dominantly inherited
trait. So, you actually have to

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
test whether it's recessive
or dominant. Often it will be

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
recessive. So, usually
most of these simple

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
auxotrophs are recessive traits.
Occasionally some are dominant.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
So, now, suppose we get a whole
collection of Arg auxotrophs,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
and we'll just give them a name.
I don't know. Here's my collection.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
We'll call the first one,
for lack of anything terribly

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
creative, Arg 1, Arg
2, Arg 3, et cetera,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
each being an individual strain from
growing up originally for a single

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
colony that is unable to
produce its own arginine.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
We now want to take this
collection and characterize it.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
How many distinct genes does this
affect? Are these mutants perhaps

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
all in the same gene? Are
they in a hundred different

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
genes? How could we
tell? Now, of course,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
if you're a biochemist, you
already know the protein you can

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
see and dah, dah, dah.
But, if you know the answer,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
well, why are asking then, right?
A geneticist goes out to ask this

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
question because he or she wants to
know all the possible ways you can

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
disrupt the cell so it cannot
make arginine. And we don't know in

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
advance what those ways are, so
how are we going to be able to

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
tell whether or not different
mutations affect the same gene,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
the same function in yeast?
It's an interesting question.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Geneticists do a variety of tests.
The first test that a geneticist

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:20.000
does to characterize a mutant is by
tests of recessivity or dominance,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
whichever way you
want to put it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
We want to take each mutant and test
whether it is recessive or dominant

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
as a phenotype,
whether the phenotype,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
the auxotrophy for arginine
is recessive or dominant.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
So, here's mutant number one,
the mutant cell carrying this

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
mutation here. Conceptually
it affects some gene.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I'm going to label it Arg 1. We
don't know where it is in the genome.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
There are other chromosomes here
as well. Here's my mutant cell.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
How am I going to find out whether
or not the auxotrophy for arginine

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
is recessive or
dominant? Yup? With what?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Cross it with a haploid that is
a prototroph, or I could just say

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
cross it with wild type,
right? Perfect. So, make a cross

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
here, very good, with
wild type plus there.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
How do I know it's plus there?
This is wild type. Wild type is

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
defined as the normal form. And
so, because I said this is what

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
we're using as wild type, it's
necessarily plus because we're

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
measuring mutations relative to wild
type. So, what happens when we get

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
here? We now, when we
cross we get a diploid,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
and Arg 1 plus. Now, how do we know
whether or not that phenotype was

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
recessive or dominant? Sorry?
It's what shows up when we

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
try to grow it. So,
when we cross it,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
what kind of plate should we grow
it on first? Should we grow it on

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
minimal or rich? We better
grow it on rich because

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
just in case it doesn't, it
can't make its own arginine,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
we better first let it grow and then
test it. So, let's grow it on rich

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
medium. We'll cross these together,
grow it on rich medium. So, grow on

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
rich, test on minimal. OK?
And we'll be able to check out

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
the phenotype as to whether or not
the phenotype is wild type or mutant.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
All right. So,
we could do that.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And we'll test the first one and
the second one and third one and the

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
fourth one. And,
for each of these,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
we'll write down whether it's
recessive or a dominant auxotroph.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Now, let me assume that all
the ones we're talking about are

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
recessive phenotypes. Because
everything I'm about to say

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
is very much harder if it turned
out any of them were dominant.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So, we're going to assume.
Let's assume now, but it's not

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
always the case, we'll
assume that the collection,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
maybe Arg 100, are all recessive
auxotrophies, the phenotype

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000
is recessive. Now, how do
I tell if they're in the

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000
same gene or not? So, now
I want to characterize my

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:55.000
mutant by some other test that will
tell me whether or not Arg 1 and Arg

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000
2 are in the same gene.
Suppose Arg 1 and Arg 2 are in

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
different genes. Cross
them. What will happen?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Right. So, to repeat that, if I
cross together the two mutants and

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
they're in different genes,
each will have at least, the each

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
will be contributing a good copy,
a functional copy, a wild type copy

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
of one of the genes. So,
let's walk this through.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Interesting. Interesting. So,
suppose I take a situation where

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I've got Arg 1, a mutation
in a gene over here,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
on this chromosome, and on the other
chromosome I've got a wild type copy.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
My Arg 1 mutant is
mutated in a gene here.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I've got this other gene here,
which is normal. And I'm going to

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
cross that now by the strain that
has a wild type copy here for this

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
first gene, but it has a
mutation in the second gene.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
When I cross them together, I
now get me a diploid cell here,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
which is Arg 1, a mutation
there, plus there, plus copy

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
here, and Arg 2.
Will having one copy,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
one working copy of this gene
be enough to make the enzyme?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
No? In other words, is the wild
type phenotype dominant to this

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
auxotrophy, or is the
auxotrophy attributable to this

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
gene recessive? Yes. Why?
Because we assumed it.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Why did we assume it? So I
would be able to say this,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
right? OK. If it wasn't we'd be in
trouble. But by assuming that we're

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
working with a recessive phenotype,
then we know that this will be

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
enough to save the yeast.
What about here? Enough to save

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
the yeast so it will
grow without arginine.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
By contrast, suppose it was
the case that this cell here,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Arg 1, and suppose our other mutant
that we had isolated in our mutant

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:56.000
hunt was a mutation Arg 2 in the
same gene. Suppose these were the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
same gene. When I cross them
together I now have a cell

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000
that is Arg 1, Arg
2. In other words,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:24.000
its genotype is Arg 1 over Arg 2,
name of mutation. And can it grow?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:34.000
No growth without arginine. By
contrast, the genotype here is Arg 1

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
over plus, plus over Arg 2. I
could even write Arg 2 over plus,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.000
but I just did that to indicate
the chromosomes that they came from.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
All right. This is called a Test
of Complementation because these two

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.000
genes are able to compliment
each other's defect.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:18.000
If two mutations compliment each
other's defect then they are in

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:30.000
different genes. OK?
Boy, that's a noisy one.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
So, we're able to make
a Complementation Table.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Suppose I take a bunch of yeasts,
wild type, WT, mutant number one,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
mutant number two,
mutant number three,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
mutant number four. And suppose I
cross them with each other in all

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
pair-wise combinations. I've
assumed that all of these

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
arginine auxotrophs have
a recessive phenotype here.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
These are all my Arg mutants,
and I'm assuming that this is

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
recessive. What happens when I
cross them and I test to see whether

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
they can grow without arginine?
If I cross wild type by wild type,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
can it grow without arginine?
Yeah. Normal phenotype. So, plus is

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
going to mean prototrophic.
Minus will mean auxotrophic for

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
arginine. What happens when I cross
wild type with mutant number one?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
It grows. Why? By assumption,
these were all recessive.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I'm only testing recessive ones.
Two. Three. Four. When I cross

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
in this direction,
wild type by these guys.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
This is going to be a
symmetric matrix, of course,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
right? OK. Now, what happens when
I cross mutant one by mutant one?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I now have a diploid. Will
it be able to grow without

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
arginine? No. Why not?
It has no working copies

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
of that gene, so I'm going to put
a minus there. What about mutant two

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
with mutant two? Minus.
What about mutant three

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
with mutant three? Minus.
What about mutant four with

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
mutant four? Minus. Now,
what happens when I cross

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
mutant one by mutant two? It
depends. It might be plus or

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
might be minus. If
they're in the same gene,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
minus. Different genes, could
be plus. So, here's some data.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So, all this is compelled.
But the kind of data, ooh,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I'll use a color. Isn't that fun?
They want me to use colors over

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
there. Here we go. Suppose
the data were minus,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
minus, plus, plus, plus, plus,
minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
plus. What
would it be?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000
What conclusion could we draw?
Is mutant one and mutant three in

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the same gene? They
compliment each other?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000
No. But is one in the same
gene as two? Yes. In fact,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
this box and this box here
define the genes beautifully.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
The groups that failed to compliment
define mutations in the same gene.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
These are called Complementation
Groups because they don't compliment,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
OK? It's a little complicated
but that's all right.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
These are called Complementation
Groups because all the members of

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
the complementation group,
namely Arg 1 and Arg 2, failed to

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
compliment each other. They
could be called failure to

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
compliment groups, but
it would be too long.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
OK? So, there you go. You
can take hundreds of mutants

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
and organize them into
complementation groups and thereby

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
know which ones go to the same
gene. And now, if I want to study the

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
genes, I only have to study the
distinct complementation groups.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Last thing, which we'll just have
time to do, are what's called tests

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
of epistasis. We'll probably run
just a moment or two over on this.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Suppose a biochemist were
collaborating with a geneticist and

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
had studied what he or she thought
was the pathway for making arginine.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Some precursor alpha
goes to precursor beta,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
goes to precursor gamma,
goes to arginine. And suppose

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
specific genes were needed
to encode specific proteins.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I'll call them Arg A, Arg B,
Arg C to catalyze each step

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
of this biochemical reaction.
The geneticist and the biochemist

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
could collaborate with each other
to study whether these mutants,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
these particular genes now
that had been identified,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
affected each step of the pathway.
And here's how they might do it.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
They might take wild type yeast,
mutant, well, they wouldn't know in

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
advance whether or not it was
missing the ability to grow on each

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
of, whether it was missing
each of these enzymes,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
but let's think conceptually.
Suppose we had a mutant that was,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
a strain that was wild type,
Arg A minus, Arg B, minus,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Arg C minus, unable to make
this enzyme, this enzyme,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
this enzyme. And suppose we helped
it along. Suppose we gave the

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
mutant arginine. Suppose
we supplement and grow it

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
on media with arginine. Which
ones will be able to grow with

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
arginine? Can wild type
grow if it's given arginine?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
What about Arg A minus? B
minus? C minus? What if instead

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
we offer it precursor gamma?
Will wild type be able to grow if

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
it's given precursor gamma?
Sure. What about Arg A minus?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
No, because it still
is stuck at this step.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
It cannot. What about Arg B minus?
What about Arg C minus? Really?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
It hasn't got this enzyme.
What's it going to do with gamma?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
It ain't got anything to
do with gamma, no enzyme.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Suppose I gave it beta. Wild
type, can it grow? What about

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Arg A minus? No, because it
can go from alpha to beta,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
but it can't go to
gamma. It cannot grow.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
What about Arg B minus? I've
given it beta, but it can't do

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
anything with beta because
it hasn't got this gene.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
What about Arg C minus? Wait
a second. What did I just do?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
We're just backward. Sorry.
If we gave it gamma, I just

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
got lost here. If we gave
it gamma it was able to

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
grow, well, we are completely
wrong, guys. It's able to grow here.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Thank you. Let's go back on that.
You should have caught me before.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
My mistake. If we have it gamma
it's able to, if it's a mutant here

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
it can grow because it bypasses this
problem. And having gamma is enough.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
If I gave it beta, sorry,
if I gave it gamma and its

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
mutation was here
it can grow. Sorry.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Now, if I gave it here beta,
and its mutation was here, it can

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
still grow, right? But
if its mutation is here it

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
can't and if its mutation is
here it can't. That's better.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I was getting worried there for
a while myself. Suppose I gave it

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
alpha. Wild type can grow. If
I give this guy alpha, will that

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
help if he's mutant in A? No.
Can it help if he's mutant in

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
B? No. Can it help
if he's mutant in C?

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
No. Sorry. There we go. I
usually start at the other end of

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
this picture. So, what you
can see is these mutants

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
have different phenotypes with
respect to being able to supplement

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
them with different chemicals.
Now, let me ask in our last two

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
minutes, I'll run two minutes over
here. Suppose I gave you a mutant

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
that was a double homozygote.
Suppose it was Arg B minus,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Arg B minus, sorry, Arg B minus
and Arg C minus. Suppose it was a

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.000
double mutant, it lacked
both this and this.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Which line of my table would it
resemble? Would it look like the

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
first line, the second line
or the third line of my table?

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Second line. Why's that? If
I'm lacking B, I'm already in

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
trouble here. And also
lacking C doesn't matter.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So, I will look, just
like a mutant who lacks B.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000
So, in other words, I'm able,
if I know something about the

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
biochemistry of a pathway and I can
break my arginine mutants up into

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
different kinds of phenotypes here
by their response to different steps

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
in a pathway, I can then look
at combinations of mutants.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And I can say if I have a double
mutant missing both B and C,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
does it look like B or does it
look C when I put them together?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And it turns out that if it looks
like B then B was further upstream

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
in the pathway. So, it
turns out that geneticists

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
and biochemists can collaborate
based on the phenotype of the

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
organism sometimes to infer
aspects of the biochemical pathway.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
These are the kinds of things
a geneticist does to be able to

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
characterize mutants on a mutant
hunt. Next time what I want to do

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
is talk about characterizing mutants
in a very different kind of organism,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
namely the
human being.

[SQUEAKING]
[RUSTLING] [CLICKING]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.590
FRANK SCHILBACH: OK, so
what happened last time?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.650
So we talked about
the workhorse model

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.060
of classical or
classical economics,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.960
in terms of discounting-- the
exponential discounted utility

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.080
model.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.160
This is a very useful
model for many settings.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.320
It's been very useful for
explain and understand

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.220
a bunch of behaviors.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.760
However, this model
has a few assumptions

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.370
that create some predictions
that are not necessarily

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.810
borne out in the data.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.810
And we're trying to improve
on those assumptions

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.972
and make the model
more realistic.

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:47.180
What are these assumptions
and what kinds of examples

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.860
did I show you that
perhaps were not

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.590
consistent with the
exponential discounting model?

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.220
I'll actually show them to you.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.570
But can somebody explain
to you what they are

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.110
and why those are not
consistent with the exponential

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.860
discounting model?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.209
Yes.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.790
AUDIENCE: You
shouldn't determine--

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.010
you shouldn't care about
whether it's a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.970
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.850
So one key assumption in the
exponential discounting model

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.680
is that there's one
parameter, delta,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.210
that essentially steers
how much you care about

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.120
different periods of time,
the present and the future,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.160
or two future periods.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.840
The key assumption here
is that how much weight

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.720
do you put on
different time periods,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.090
on early and a later date,
is constant across time.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.360
So from today versus
tomorrow, there's

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.210
the same difference compared to,
like, when you look at a year

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.220
from now and a year
and a day from now,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.410
or 20 days and 21 days.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.930
The difference, if you care
more about the present,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.620
that's constant across time
from today's perspective,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.163
also from future perspective.

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:53.080
That's one assumption.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.030
And what evidence
did we see or show

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.888
that that's not consistent with?

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:00.055
AUDIENCE: Choosing a reward.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:02.380
Do you want the money now
or is this today or in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.772
a year or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:06.730
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.320
So we saw some
evidence that people

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.729
are impatient in the short run.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.950
So when it comes to today
versus tomorrow or today

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.325
versus in a week
from now, people

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.770
tend to be fairly impatient.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.450
They tend to discount
the future a lot.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.200
Now, there's sort of
two issues with that.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.600
One is, if you do the same
thing about asking people

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.420
about future rewards, people
tend to be more patient.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.860
So the discount factors
that you elicit,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.910
we'll talk a little bit about
that in a recitation, as well.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.560
The discount factors
are just different

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.890
for the same intervals of time.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.078
Second, if you take the short
run and patience seriously--

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:40.870
if you sort of say,
OK, I take your choices

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.780
from today versus tomorrow or
from today versus next week

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.800
and [INAUDIBLE] run
that forward, you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.740
got sort of absurd
implications as in, like,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.580
if you really seriously discount
a week from now by a lot,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.510
then you shouldn't care
about a year from now,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.400
five years from now.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.073
You shouldn't care
about that at all.

00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.490
However, we see
in the real world,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.100
people have lots of-- people
care about the future a lot.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.970
People save money.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.220
People get education
and so on and so forth.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370
So it can't be in
some ways that they're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.500
really impatient in
the long run, as well.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.680
So that's, like, number one.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.650
What about point number two?

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.140
Yes.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.010
AUDIENCE: Your decision
now for the future

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.190
should be the same
as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:26.260
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.930
That's called dynamic
or time consistency.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.990
That's an assumption or
implication of the exponential

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.520
discounting model.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.410
That is to say, if
I make some choices

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.610
for the future, for future
periods, about how I--

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.370
what I'm going to study next
week or in a year from now,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.070
or whether I'm going to
exercise and so on, for choices

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.240
that involve time in the
future, once that time comes,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.580
absent new information or
absent circumstances change,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.290
I should follow
through with my plans.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.900
And so if that's not the
case, then what we say

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.990
is that preferences are
dynamically inconsistent.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.710
That is to say, I have all
sorts of plans of exercising

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.847
next week and so on.

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:07.680
The next week comes.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.340
Surprise, I'm not
following through.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.010
That essentially means my
preferences are inconsistent.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.230
And that's sort of evidence
against the exponential

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.250
discounting model.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.200
OK.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.910
Number three, demand
for commitment.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.169
Yes?

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.192
There are [INAUDIBLE] people
will often do that [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:31.780
and that shows that
people [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.820
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.560
So one sort of key
assumption or one sort

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.545
of key insight from sort
of economics in general,

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.440
or classical economics, and it's
like, more choices are good.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.180
Like, if you have more
options available,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.760
that's great for you, because
you can take advantage of them.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.260
You never know
whether there's going

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.392
to be uncertainty or certain
circumstances change.

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:51.100
So you should never
restrict your choices

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.058
because you never know.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.790
Maybe in the future, maybe
circumstances change.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.650
Maybe I got really
busy, or whatever.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.620
Things happen.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.350
So more choice tends to be good.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.810
So in the neoclassical or
classical economics model,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.360
there's no scope
for or no reason

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.900
to restrict your choices because
more choices in the future

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.190
are always good.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.813
However, if you're worried about
your future self misbehaving

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.230
in certain ways,
if you're worried

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.200
about your future
self not exercising,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.660
eating too many potato chips,
and so on and so forth,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.910
you might want to engage
in commitment devices,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.950
either by taking
away certain options,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.220
like restricting your choice
set to a smaller choice set,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.155
or, less drastically, making
future choices more expensive.

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:32.530
That is to say,
for example, if I

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.480
say I'm going to
submit or write a paper

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.820
by the end of this week,
if I'm going to tell you

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.370
if I don't do that I'm
going to give you $100,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.530
well, what I'm going
to do essentially

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.610
is I'm making not writing
the paper more expensive.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.402
And the neoclassical
or the classical model

00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:48.943
had the exponential
discounting model

00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:50.570
has essentially
no scope for that.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.030
Why would I ever do that?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.780
Because who knows.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.137
Maybe I'll get sick
or stuff happens.

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:56.470
So there's no reason to do that.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.845
There's no benefit
of doing that.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.750
And it's a potential cost.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.800
So if I see myself or somebody
else restricting their choices,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.640
that's a violation of the
exponential discounting model.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.360
And the reason, of course,
for that is number two.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.920
We know there's
preference for it.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.437
If you think there are
future preference reversals,

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:16.270
if I think that in the
future I might change

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.550
my preferences in a
way that I don't like,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.190
if I want my future self
to behave in certain ways

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.460
that I prefer right now, I might
want to restrict my choice set.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.040
I might certain unpreferrable--
like, less preferable

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.242
options more costly.

00:06:30.242 --> 00:06:31.970
OK.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.470
Good.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.730
So then what we did next
is to say, OK, now--

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.960
so I showed you a bunch
of evidence of that.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.250
And then what we did is
then we sort of presented

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.620
a slight deviation from
the exponential discounting

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.840
model, which is the
quasi-hyperbolic discounting

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.740
model.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.210
That model is, in
some sense, very

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.790
similar to the exponential
discounting model

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.280
that I showed you, except
for some small difference.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.070
There's an additional
parameter that's called beta.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.120
What does this beta do?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.440
It's like a short term discount
factor that essentially guides

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.230
all discounting or
determines all discounting

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.780
between the present
period, right now,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.180
versus anything
that's in the future.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.000
One broad question is like,
what are the time periods?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.810
Is it daily?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.410
Is it yearly?

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.950
Is it monthly or whatever?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.950
There's actually quite a
bit of research on this

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.660
that people try to
figure this out.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.270
Usually we think the beta or
the time horizon of the beta

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.200
is actually just a few
days, even just a few hours.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.728
So for our purposes, we can
say it's daily or today.

00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:30.520
And anything that you'll
see in the problem

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.530
sets and so on, it needs
to be always defined.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.660
But think of beta
essentially anything

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.390
that's like today or in
the next couple of days.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.900
Anything outside of that
scope is essentially outside

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.450
of the scope of beta and
sort of in the future.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.890
Now, what does this beta do?

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.640
Well, it helps us to
separate discounting

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.160
for short horizons
and long horizons,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.310
because if you think about
discounting between the present

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.570
and anything in the future,
the data can steer that, right?

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.260
If beta is 0.7, 0.6,
or 0.8 or whatever,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.060
I can now be impatient
for the present.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.960
I can now prefer, say, $10
today versus $12 in the future.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.430
The beta will make
sure that that happens.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.160
But when you look at
all future periods,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.960
the beta is in all
future periods.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.090
It appears everywhere
in the utility function

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.570
in all future periods.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.990
So the beta does not
affect how am I discounting

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.800
any future time periods.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.970
So then the delta
is steering that.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.390
We usually think that
delta is close to 1.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.590
It's something like yearly
0.95 or 0.99 or the like.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.860
So delta is essentially
reasonably close to 1,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.900
such that I can
be fairly patient

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.110
between 10 years from now and
11 years from now and 15 years

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.140
from now.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.490
It doesn't matter much to me.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.580
There's only going to be
some slight discounting.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.860
I prefer probably things
that are happening five years

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.260
from now from things
that are happening

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.580
30 years from now for the
same sort of stuff happening.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.718
But people tend to
be fairly patient.

00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:02.260
Do you have any
questions about that?

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.480
OK.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.760
So let me now sort of spend, in
fact, the rest of the lecture

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.040
just talking about
details of this model,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.540
in part sort of
building intuition,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.730
sort of showing you the
mechanics of how that works

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.630
and how, essentially, having
an additional discount

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.940
parameter of the data
affects people's choices.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.190
And second, we're going to
talk about something that's

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.523
quite important, which is the
question of sophistication

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:35.850
versus naivete.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.880
What do I mean by that?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.320
Well, in the exponential
discounting model,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.530
by assumption, the preferences
are time consistent.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.370
What does that mean?

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.470
If I make plans
for the future, I

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.792
will follow through
with those plans.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.250
So in some sense,
it doesn't really

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.020
matter what I think I'm
going to do in the future,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.370
because essentially,
I'm going to do anyway

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.840
what I'm going to plan anyway.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.460
So the only thing
I need to know is

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.420
right now what I'm going to do.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.200
And then if I make that plan,
unless circumstances change,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.318
I'm going to just
follow through.

00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:05.610
That's not true here anymore,
as I'm going to show you.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.490
So now it's the case that if
I make some plans right now,

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.470
these plans might change
in the future because

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.090
of my preferences.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.830
Even in the absence
of new information

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.160
or new circumstances, once
tomorrow comes or next week

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.170
comes, I might sort of
prefer different things.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.890
So now the preference are not
dynamically consistent anymore.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:28.080
So what I prefer today might
not be what I prefer next week.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.730
So that now leads
to a complication.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.323
Now I need to
understand, well, what

00:10:32.323 --> 00:10:34.740
are my beliefs about what I'm
going to do in the future is

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.340
quite important.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.270
Do I have correct beliefs?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.973
Do I understand that
I'm present biased?

00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:39.390
Do I understand
that in the future

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.160
I might be impatient, as well?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.300
Or am I naive?

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.940
Do I think right now I'm present
biased, but tomorrow comes

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.430
or next week I'm going to
exercise, do the problem set

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.240
early, and so on and so forth?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.650
And as we're going to see, that
will lead to quite different--

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.820
starkly different
conclusions or implications

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.890
that are quite important for
outcomes, welfare, and so on.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.670
OK.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.330
So let me give you
some examples first.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.460
So first, if you have a
discount function for beta

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.895
equals 1/2 and
delta close to 1--

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:15.270
for our purposes,
often I'm going

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.460
to set delta to 1, not
because I necessarily

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.410
think that delta is 1.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.530
Delta is probably 0.99,
0.95, or the like.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.960
I'm just setting it to
1 to make the algebra

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.510
or sort of any
problem set exercises

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.870
and so on being less messy.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.620
Speaking of which,
problem set exercises--

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.440
Pierre-Luc who sits in
the very back and checks

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.023
whether you are using
your laptop only

00:11:36.023 --> 00:11:39.540
for classwork, Pierre-Luc
sort of mostly in charge

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.870
of doing the problem sets.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.505
So he also has office
hours, to which

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:44.880
you can come and ask specific
questions about the problem

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.150
sets.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.275
Of course, he's also very
happy to answer questions

00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:51.150
about Piazza or
in any other way.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.668
When are your office hours?

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:54.437
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:55.770
FRANK SCHILBACH: 1:30 on Friday.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.540
And where are they?

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.828
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:00.870
FRANK SCHILBACH: Perfect.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.585
So it's on the course website.

00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:03.960
So if you have
specific questions

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.530
about the problem set,
again, in the recitation,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.960
we'll discuss quite a few
issues related to that.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.335
But then if you have specific
questions about the problem

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:16.840
set, Pierre-Luc will be the
best equipped to answer those.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.520
OK.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.440
So if you have quasi-hyperbolic
discounting preferences,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.080
with beta equals 1/2
and delta equals 1,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.750
your discounting function
looks, essentially, as follows.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.900
The first period is
sort of normalized to 1.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.410
[INAUDIBLE] like one
about the current period.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.530
In the future then it's, like,
beta delta, beta delta square,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.790
beta delta to the
power of 3, and so on.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.053
But if you sort of now
use delta equals 1,

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.220
you get, essentially-- you
care about the present 1.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.570
And everything in the
future is discounted by 1/2.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.160
OK, so relative to
the present period,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.900
all future periods
are worth less.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.340
So I care a lot
about the present.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.980
That's why we call it sort of
present bias or present focus.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.290
I care a lot more about
the present than anything

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.800
in the future.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.610
Now, second, all discounting
in this specific example

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.470
takes place between the present
and the immediate future.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.870
So I only care about--

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.707
in terms of discounting--
all future periods

00:13:08.707 --> 00:13:09.540
are the same for me.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.915
I don't care about
whether things

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.170
are in five periods or six
or seven periods from now.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.720
That's all the same for me,
because delta, in this case,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.040
is 1.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.750
Instead, what I care
about is that today

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.500
versus tomorrow or today versus
three days from now, and so on.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.680
Again, usually delta
would not be one.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.330
So if you had a delta that's,
like, 0.99 or the like,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.880
there would be some discounting
in the future, as well.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.290
But not in this case.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.280
So that's sort of capturing the
intuition that the long run--

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.500
in the long run, we
are relatively patient.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.690
There is essentially no
discounting happening anymore.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.110
And so the utils a
year from now are just

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.050
as valuable as utils
in two years from now.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.312
So then that also means that
the timing of decisions or--

00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:52.020
the decisions are
sensitive to the timing

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.080
of costs and benefits, when
exactly did they occur.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.910
It matters a lot
whether stuff happens

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.985
today versus tomorrow or today
versus three days from now.

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:03.360
It matters much less about
whether stuff happens in three

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.652
days versus four days from now.

00:14:04.652 --> 00:14:06.578
I'm going to show you
some examples of that.

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:08.370
But just to sort of
give you some sense of,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.662
like, why is this called
quasi-hyperbolic or hyperbolic

00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:12.760
discounting?

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.005
So have your three functions.

00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:15.630
I'm not sure how well
you can see this.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.460
But there's, like,
a sort of pink line

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.472
that's essentially like
an exponential curve.

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:22.680
That's essentially what
exponential discounting looks

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.240
like.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.740
Essentially what you see is
sort of a constant, if you want,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.690
sort of decline of like
the discount function.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.447
And then I've also
plotted to you

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:35.280
hyperbolic discounting,
which is essentially

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.810
like a true hyperbolic curve.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.352
That's essentially
the thing that you

00:14:38.352 --> 00:14:43.640
see on the left, the one
that's sort of like much

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.190
steeper at the beginning.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.880
And then there is
quasi-hyperbolic discounting

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.830
that's essentially
quite similar in shape,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.440
as you can see, to the
hyperbolic discounting,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.750
except for the fact that
it's not continuous.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.710
There's a jump from going one
to beta at the very beginning.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.480
It's not a continuous function.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.980
Essentially, there's
a discrete jump

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.410
between today and the future.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.690
And then essentially it
behaves very similarly

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.842
to the exponential
discounting curve.

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:10.800
But that's just to tell
you it doesn't really--

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.600
you don't have to worry about
the hyperbolic discounting

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.100
and so on.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.480
We're not going to
discuss that very much.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.070
But that's just for
you to understand

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.690
why is that the name?

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.150
Well, it's because essentially
it's quasi-hyperbolic.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.942
It's not really hyperbolic
because it's not

00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:24.840
really hyperbola.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.520
But in fact, it looks
quite similar, effectively.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:37.295
So then when you think about
goods that you might consume,

00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:38.670
there's different
types of goods.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.890
There's leisure goods and
there's investment goods.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.515
Let's sort of start
with leisure goods.

00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:43.515
What's a leisure good?

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:46.650
A leisure good is a good
that has immediate rewards

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.780
and delayed costs.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.760
One example would
be eating candy.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.700
So eating candy, of course, you
get immediate utility benefits.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.800
It's pleasurable to eat candy.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.030
So that's positive.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.680
In this case, suppose the
benefits are the pleasure

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.420
of eating candy right now.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:09.150
But often eating candy, it
leads to delayed health costs

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.120
or delayed costs at
the dentist's office,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.280
which summarizes C health
of 3 in the future.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.270
If you now say, well,
if beta equals 1/2

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.380
and a delta equals 1, well,
you can sort think about,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.620
would you eat candy today
or candy in the future?

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.320
So first starting off
with eating candy today--

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.040
well, if you sort of calculate
the costs and benefits

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.540
of eating candy, the pleasure
that you get from candy is 2.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.690
If you discount
the future by beta,

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.240
essentially everything in the
future is discounted by beta,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.310
it's like 1/2 times 3.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.140
So if you sort of
do that calculation,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.330
you get something positive.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.320
So if you think about
eating candy right now,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.250
the answer is yes, because 2
minus 1/2 times 3 is positive

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.990
and you're going to do that.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.490
If instead you think
about, should I

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.050
eat candy in the future?

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.820
Well, you get
different implications.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.680
The answer is no.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.589
Why is the answer no?

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.079
Because if you're in
the future, everything

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.510
is discounted that's
happening in the future, both

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.119
the pleasure that comes
from eating candy next week,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.680
but also the delayed costs are
essentially discounted by beta.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.690
So then you essentially
just have, like, 1/2.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.540
This is the beta for everything
in the future times two,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.950
which are the benefits,
minus 3, which are the costs.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.730
And that's smaller than 0.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.740
So you're not going to do that.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.110
And that's sort of a
general feature for leisure

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.440
good, as we call them.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.455
These have immediate rewards
and delayed benefits.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.830
And so what you
tend to do is you

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.300
tend to overconsume them
in the present relative

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.890
to long run plans.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.608
Yeah?

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:47.473
AUDIENCE: Are you only
considering [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:47.473 --> 00:17:48.390
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.840
So yeah, you can think of
this as, like, a shorthand

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.340
form of saying, for example,
suppose you eat a lot of candy

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.597
or, like, on one day you
eat candy and suppose

00:17:58.597 --> 00:18:00.180
you know-- these are
repeated choices,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.730
but I'm sort of
aggregating it into one.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.400
You'll have, essentially,
health costs in the future.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.390
Suppose you get dental
pain in the future.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.310
Each period you have dental pain
starting at age 30 or 40 or 50.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.660
Now, you can sort of think
of this as like each day

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.368
you're going to have
negative utility.

00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:19.410
What I'm doing now is I'm
sort of collapsing that

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.350
into one day in a sense of
just making sure that-- to make

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.520
it sort of tractable.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.140
So you can think of
the delayed health

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.200
costs as a summary of
the health costs overall.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.680
Instead you could also
write down 0.1 for your 40,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.830
0.1 for your 41, and
so on and so forth,

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.560
and sort of aggregating
in that way.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.050
But that's just for
simplicity here.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.320
Similarly, you could
also say each day

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.300
you'll have essentially
a choice to eat candy.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.673
And these things sort of add up.

00:18:46.673 --> 00:18:48.840
And again, sort of simplifying
in a sense of saying,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.300
like, should I
eat candy overall,

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.920
which is a number
of different choices

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.420
that each are between the
present and the future.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.410
That's just like changing the
units in some way overall.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.380
I think the structure of
the problem is the same.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.694
Yeah?

00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:04.955
AUDIENCE: So
obviously this is kind

00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:07.473
of comparing apples and oranges.

00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:15.490
But I the one kind of
[INAUDIBLE] is your health is

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.382
kind of the sum of a bunch
of actions that you did over

00:19:19.382 --> 00:19:20.965
your lifetime that
affect your health,

00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:25.590
versus candy is something that--

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.630
the pleasure that you get
out of candy is exactly--

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.640
fully [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.280
So when people-- when you
do this kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.670
discounting and you're trying
to compare health in the future,

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.580
like, pleasure now, the fact
that the candy contributes such

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.670
a small amount to
your overall health,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.843
it seems kind of like
an apples to oranges--

00:19:47.843 --> 00:19:48.760
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.820
To some degree, I
think that's right.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.860
I think it's, in some sense,
that's just an example.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.260
So I could show you
many different things

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.940
that are sort of
similar in structure.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.520
I'm using candy just
to make it concrete.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.580
You could do the same with
problem sets and other pain,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.010
or exercising, and
so on and so forth.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.950
I think at the end of the day,
I think that's exactly right.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.910
For a lot of choices
that people make--

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.845
be it brushing their
teeth, be it exercising,

00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:13.600
be it eating
healthily and so on,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.610
often the costs or
the benefits are

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.900
very salient in the present.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.007
They're very salient
and concrete.

00:20:19.007 --> 00:20:20.840
Right now you have a
cookie in front of you.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.465
You can eat it.

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:23.620
You'll be happy,
and that's for sure.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.540
Sometime in 20
years from now, you

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.160
might be sort of like unhealthy.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.800
You might get dental problems
and so on and so forth.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.970
Not only is it sort
of very far away,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.640
but it's also very diffuse.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.322
It's also maybe unlikely.

00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:37.030
Like, there's a chance
of getting a heart

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.680
attack at age 70.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.610
Maybe, maybe not.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.220
Maybe you'll be just fine.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.760
So it's more complicated in
a lot of health decisions.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.120
So there's other research
saying, like, well, partially

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.380
it's about uncertainty.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.930
Partially it's about
the future being diffuse

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.540
and very sort of unclear.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.150
One part of that people tend
to think is time preferences.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.590
But I think what you're
saying is the world is

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.730
more complicated than that.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.710
And that's for sure true.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.260
What I'm sort of saying is,
like, thinking about time

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.690
preferences can help you
understand some choices

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.722
that people make over time.

00:21:06.722 --> 00:21:08.680
Having said that, there's
lots of other aspects

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.990
here, which we're sort
of grossly simplifying.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.850
But I think the key part here--

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.310
I think what's really important
for a lot of health choices

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.320
tends to be that people--

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.690
that exactly as you
say, there's a lot

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.928
of-- like, thousands
of really small choices

00:21:21.928 --> 00:21:24.220
that sort of add up to
something like-- what we call it

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.200
unhealthy behavior in some way.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.290
And each of them are concrete
in some sense in terms

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.490
of the costs and benefits.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.890
Like, brushing your teeth
is like costly in some sense

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.290
for five minutes or whatever.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.710
Eating candy is happy
for a few minutes,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.480
as well, very concretely.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.710
And then the costs are
often diffuse in the future

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.210
and so on.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.470
That's really important.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.303
We're going to talk a
little bit about this.

00:21:46.303 --> 00:21:47.740
But we sort of--
for now at least

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.530
abstracting,
essentially, that away.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.838
Yes?

00:21:52.838 --> 00:21:55.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.841
Why is it better
than the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:03.997
Why is it [INAUDIBLE] and
what actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:03.997 --> 00:22:06.622
better than the
exponential model?

00:22:06.622 --> 00:22:08.330
FRANK SCHILBACH: So
the exponential model

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.110
would not predict you
this type of behavior.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.320
So if you think about now
we get to this-- like,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.960
if you sort of say you want to
make choices for the future,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.120
the exponential
discounter would give you

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.330
the same choices for
the future versus what

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.040
actually-- when
the future arrives.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.500
So I'm going to show you a
sort of-- more in the context

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.500
of problem set, I'm going to
show you this behavior that

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.330
the exponential model cannot--

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.380
just not explain.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.190
Like, the exponential discounter
would say, either I like candy

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.900
and I don't care about--

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.450
or I just don't worry that much
about the health costs and I

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.940
eat candy, or I don't.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.690
I'm really worried
about the health costs,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.400
and therefore I don't eat candy.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.900
And that choice
is the same today

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.770
versus next week versus
two weeks from now,

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.850
and so on and so forth.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.240
So once I make a choice
for eating candy--

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.120
so here notice that the
person who will make the plans

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.570
to not eat candy in the future,
once the future arrives,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.427
that person will
change their choice

00:23:02.427 --> 00:23:04.010
and then actually
surprise themselves,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.989
potentially by eating candy.

00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:07.426
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:16.560
FRANK SCHILBACH: There's just
behaviors in the world that

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.960
the exponential discounting
model cannot explain.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.840
That is one of them.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.682
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:21.682 --> 00:23:22.890
FRANK SCHILBACH: So there's--

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.160
yeah.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.750
So I think there's
a question on what

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.347
other models can explain this.

00:23:26.347 --> 00:23:28.680
I think the hyperbolic model
is, in fact, quite similar,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.750
as it sort of showed
you in the curve here.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.440
You sort of see the discount
functions are quite similar.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.430
There's research using
the hyperbolic model.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.340
In economics in the last sort
of-- in behavioral economics

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.080
in the last something
like 20 years,

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.540
the quasi-hyperbolic
model is the model

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.810
that everybody uses, partially
for tractability and simplicity

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:53.190
for no other good
reasons in many settings.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.440
But in some sense, what we
care about-- in some sense,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.050
I don't care actually that much
about which model among sort

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.870
of a class of model that are
quite similar can explain

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.640
things sort of--

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.368
if two models explain the
same thing in similar ways,

00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:08.160
I don't care about
which one we should use.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.452
In a sense, the simpler model
is sort of easier to use,

00:24:10.452 --> 00:24:12.322
and that's why we sort of do it.

00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:14.280
What I care about is
there are some predictions

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.310
from the exponential model
that are sort of just not--

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.540
that are just false.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.400
And those we need to improve on.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.640
That could be either
through a hyperbolic model

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.170
or quasi-hyperbolic model.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.170
To keep things simple, I'm using
the quasi-hyperbolic model,

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.750
in part because it
nests very simply

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.350
in the exponential model.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.933
And the reason why
a lot of economists

00:24:33.933 --> 00:24:36.267
have used it is to say, OK,
here's an exponential model.

00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:37.590
We know how to use that model.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.450
Now we're going to
add one parameter

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.950
and things look very similar.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.800
And beta equals 1 essentially
collapses that model back

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.120
to the exponential model.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.460
And therefore,
people have used it.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.740
And that's essentially
what we do.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.430
OK.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.790
So now the flip side of
those kinds of choices

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.993
are investment goods.

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.910
Investment goods are
essentially very similar.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.618
These are goods that
have immediate costs

00:24:58.618 --> 00:25:00.450
but delayed benefits.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.130
An example would
be go to the gym.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.780
Like, you can go to
the gym right now.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.840
Some people find that
fun, but many people also

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.950
find it costly.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.050
There's some effort cost
of, say, in this case, 2.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.020
There's benefits,
health benefits, of 3.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.210
Again, that's really sort
of like a stark example.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.877
But I'm just trying to make sort
of a point to make this simple.

00:25:17.877 --> 00:25:21.720
Now, again, if we have beta
equals 1/2 and delta equals 1,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.970
if you think about should
you go to the gym today,

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.330
the answer is no.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.590
And the reason is that you put
a lot of weight on the present.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.850
You put sort of weight
of 1 on the present,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.150
the cost of minus 1--

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:33.780
sorry.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.370
You put a weight of 1
on the cost of minus 2.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.310
So you have minus 2 costs.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.700
The benefits are in the future.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.220
You discount them by beta.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.810
So you have 1/2 times 3,
which is smaller than 0.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.860
Now, if you think
about, then, are

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.680
you planning to go to the gym
next week, the answer is yes.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.345
Why is that?

00:25:50.345 --> 00:25:52.470
Well, now you're essentially
discounting everything

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.472
that's in the future, including
the costs of going to the gym.

00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.930
So you can think about, should
you go to the gym next week?

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.120
The answer will be yes.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.200
The reason is because the
health benefits overall

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.870
are larger than the costs.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.120
Now, again, what we're
going to see then

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.840
is people deviate from
their long-run plans.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.090
Now they under-consume
investment goods

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.100
relative to long run plans.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.710
So we saw previously that people
over consume leisure goods.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.390
They do too much
fun stuff that has

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.220
bad consequences in the future.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.150
And people tend to do too
little of tedious stuff

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.650
that will yield benefits
in the future relative

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.810
to their long run plans.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.480
Again, you look at sort
of timing consistency

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.420
in a sense of, like, if I plan
to go to the gym next week,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.680
I'm going to say yes.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.695
Now unless things change,
once next week arrives,

00:26:44.695 --> 00:26:46.320
I'm going to be at
the choice of, like,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.610
should I go to the gym today?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.540
I'm going to say no.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.630
I would like to not do
that because now I'm

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.700
essentially discounting the
future but not the present.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.930
Any questions on that?

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.820
Yes.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] one
more time why you discount

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:08.302
the efforts as in
the future and not--

00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:09.260
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.490
So think of these as different
periods-- so the effort--

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.070
so if you think about, should
you go until the costs are

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.713
today--

00:27:17.713 --> 00:27:19.380
think about these are
different periods.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.910
Period right now.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.210
Health benefits are,
like, say, a week later.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.240
OK.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.710
In the choice about
doing it today,

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.060
the costs are right now--
that's the present period.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.780
So if you go back to
the discount function,

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.515
you put a weight of 1 on
anything that's in the present.

00:27:33.515 --> 00:27:35.640
And anything that's in the
future, a future period,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.448
you put in a weight of 1/2.

00:27:37.448 --> 00:27:39.906
AUDIENCE: OK, so we can see
every [INAUDIBLE] in the future

00:27:39.906 --> 00:27:40.788
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.788 --> 00:27:41.830
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.140
So the effort right
now is in the present.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.252
So for like-- so start with
a choice of, like, today.

00:27:47.252 --> 00:27:48.460
The effort is in the present.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.252
That's why I'm not sort
of discounting that

00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:51.930
in the first choice for today.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.740
But if I think about
doing it next week,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.360
then next week is
also in the future.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360
I'm discounting everything
that's in the future,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.290
whether it's a week
away or two weeks ago.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.160
I don't care.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.070
And therefore, everything
is discounted by 1/2.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.030
OK.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:11.150
So now one important distinction
now is demand for commitment,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.520
or is there
commitment available?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.260
So what we're going
to do is think

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.940
about like students who have
to do problem sets with very

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.340
simple beta delta preferences.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.580
So consider a student with beta
equals 1/2, delta equals 1.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.503
There's three periods.

00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:27.920
And this is sort
of getting pretty

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.087
close to what you're going
to do in the problem set,

00:28:30.087 --> 00:28:31.140
actually, yourself.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.480
There are three periods.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.770
You have to do the problem
set in exactly one of three

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.270
periods.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.395
That's, of course, contrived
and a little stylized.

00:28:37.395 --> 00:28:40.340
But that's just an
example for now.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.400
So there's periods T equals
0, T equals 1, T equals 2.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.460
The instantaneous utility
is of minus 1, three halves,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.240
and five halves.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.800
So the problem set becomes
more and more painful the later

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.440
we actually do it.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.500
OK.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.190
And there's only one day in
which you can actually do it.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.158
So now the first thing
that I think about is

00:28:58.158 --> 00:28:59.700
suppose there's
commitment available.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.220
What does that mean?

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.803
Suppose a student
can essentially just

00:29:01.803 --> 00:29:03.860
pick, when is she going
to do the problem set,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.180
and actually stick to that.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.805
Suppose they could
just sort of dictate

00:29:06.805 --> 00:29:09.600
what she's going to do in the
future, what would she choose?

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.577
Well-- and then she actually
has to sort of stick with that.

00:29:13.577 --> 00:29:16.160
So now we can sort think about,
from the perspective of period

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.000
zero, remember the person
is a hyperbolic discounter

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.520
with beta equals 1/2.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.630
From the perspective of right
now, I'm going to say, well,

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.100
the discounted utility
today is minus 1.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.030
There's no discounting happening
for today if I do it today.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.730
For tomorrow, I'm going to
discount the future by 1/2.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.770
So I'm going to get minus 3/4.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.140
And in the period 2
in 2 days from now,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.700
I'm going to do 1/2 minus--

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.030
times minus five halves,
which is five quarters.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.940
So if I could sort of predict--
if I could sort of say what

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.025
I would like to do, I
would say, well, I'm

00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:51.650
going to do it in
[INAUDIBLE] equals 1.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:57.700
I'm going to do it tomorrow if I
could follow through with that.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.320
Is that clear?

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.100
OK.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.810
So that's if commitment
is available.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.700
That is if I could
essentially just force

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.890
myself to do stuff
in the future and not

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.990
deviate from that at all.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.420
Now if no commitment
is available,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.430
how does that thinking change?

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.240
Yes.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.730
AUDIENCE: T equals
1 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.980
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes, exactly.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.150
Once T equals 1 arrives,
I might actually

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.100
prefer not to do
it in T equals 1

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.137
but rather say I'd rather
do it in T equals 2.

00:30:36.137 --> 00:30:38.220
And this is exactly what
you're going to see here.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.018
This is the exact same problem
that I showed you before.

00:30:41.018 --> 00:30:42.810
Now, suppose the student
has no [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.995
so the commitment
technology is just to say,

00:30:44.995 --> 00:30:47.370
what if the student can just
choose in every period, what

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.220
is she going to do, would she
actually do it in period one?

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.670
Well, if period one arrives,
if the problem set is not

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.610
done, if she does
it at period one,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.440
from the perspective
of period one,

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.240
the discounted costs
are minus three halves.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.240
That's just because that's
in the current period

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.520
from the perspective
of period one.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.100
If she instead sort of were
to do it in period two,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.130
she now discounts, again,
period two from the perspective

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.630
of period one by 1/2.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.290
So 1/2 times minus
5/2 hops is 5/4.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.790
Well, 5/4 is less bad than 3/2.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.000
So she is going to say, I'm
going to do it in period two.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.060
So that's to say that students'
preferences are dynamically

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.653
inconsistent.

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:29.820
Again, that's sort of
something that the exponential

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.880
discounting model would not
predict or cannot explain

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.690
and the quasi-hyperbolic model
is one way of simply creating

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.920
such timing consistency.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.720
Yes.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.220
AUDIENCE: I was wondering how
we should think about the fact

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.845
that, for example,
you know that you're

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:46.890
going to experience [INAUDIBLE]
on the second period.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.070
So should then your second
period activity function

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.070
be the one that matters?

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.820
Shouldn't you, as a
sophisticated [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.010
minus 3/2 that it's worse from
your perspective [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.490
That utility function should
be the one that matters

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.140
and is used [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.440
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right so
you're sort of saying--

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.357
and sounds if I understood
right-- is to say--

00:32:10.357 --> 00:32:12.300
and let's see
whether that's true.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.730
You're saying, well, if no
commitment is available,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.070
I should never let
it get to that point.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.900
If I'm in period
zero, I should know

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.000
I'm not going to do it
actually in period one.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.190
Therefore, I'd rather
do it right now

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.220
to avoid that all sort of like
procrastinated from period one

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.282
to period two.

00:32:27.282 --> 00:32:28.740
And if I'm not in
period 0, I might

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.115
say I do it rather right now,
because otherwise I'm going

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.430
to just do it in period two.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.140
And from the perspective
of period zero,

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.570
I'd rather do it right now,
compared to period two.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.280
I would prefer to
do it in period one,

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.820
but that's not feasible because
my period one self will not

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.920
behave in the absence
of commitment.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.170
AUDIENCE: I was more thinking
in a way that, why would

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.230
you want to commit your
previous one [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.780
that your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.280
Because you have a
different utility

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.690
function in that period.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.170
FRANK SCHILBACH: It's just a--

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.753
I mean, something
that's an assumption

00:33:03.753 --> 00:33:06.850
in the sense of from the
perspective of period zero,

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.220
you make certain choices.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.270
You're going to say, I
could do it right now.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.530
I could do it in period one.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.150
Or I could do it in period two.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.830
Now, you have
certain preferences.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.150
And you're saying
maybe your preferences

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.983
should be different.

00:33:16.983 --> 00:33:18.280
And that's obviously fine.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.310
I sort of specified the
preferences for the student.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.350
I said that beta is 1/2.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.493
So she cares about
1/2 about anything

00:33:25.493 --> 00:33:27.160
that happens in the
future in period one

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.930
and two compared to period zero.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.200
And then sort of
just sort of like--

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.120
you just look at what
the utilities are and it

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.030
sort of turns out that from her
perspective, from period zero,

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.830
she prefers period one.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.960
Now, you could sort of
specify the utility function

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.647
differently.

00:33:42.647 --> 00:33:44.230
But for that specific
example, I guess

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.560
that's what sort of
the algebra tells us.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.060
Yeah.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.060
So now the key question
now is to say, OK,

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.197
now the preferences are
dynamically inconsistent.

00:33:57.197 --> 00:33:59.530
So now what I said-- well,
what's really important now--

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.510
and in some sense, maybe
you were asking about that,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.110
as well--

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.890
is, well, it's the
question on, like,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.560
is the student aware of
this time of consistency?

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.347
So you could say, well, when
deciding in period zero,

00:34:12.347 --> 00:34:14.889
you might sort of say, well,
I'd like to do it in period one.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.920
If I believe that in period
one, I'm time consistent,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.409
or if I believe that I'm
an exponential discounter

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.960
in the future, I will be
very virtuous in the future,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.300
well then, I'm very happy
to wait until period one.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.060
And then I'm going to follow
through with my plans.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.130
If instead I know
that in period one

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.238
I'm going to be
present bias, well then

00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:34.780
what's going to happen is then
I can't trust myself in period

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.650
one to actually do it.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.358
I know I'm going to
procrastinate further

00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:38.199
until period two.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.120
So I'd rather do
it at period zero

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.139
to avoid sort of having to
deal with it in period two.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.070
Let me sort of walk
you through that.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.719
So I guess we need sort
of additional parameters

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.000
to start with which
is called beta hat.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.520
Beta hat does essentially
the sophistication or naivete

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.570
parameter.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.760
Beta hat is your
belief about what

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.460
you think your beta
will be in the future.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.220
So beta is like what
the actual beta is.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.520
That's the true value of beta in
the present and in the future.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.590
And beta hat is
like what you think

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.260
your beta is in the
future, what you

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.310
believe your true or your
beta is going forward.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:17.560
It's not what you believe--
you know your beta today.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.140
You know that essentially
your present bias today.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.670
Everybody understands that well.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.620
That's an assumption, as well.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.120
But people do not
know or may not

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.140
know what their beta
is in the future.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.925
And that's what the parameter
of beta hat measures.

00:35:29.925 --> 00:35:31.300
You're going to
have three cases.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.790
I'm going to talk
about two cases today.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.390
There's going to be a third
case starting on Tuesday.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.390
And so the two cases that we
are discussing is full naivete.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.940
That's to say my
beta hat equals 1.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.470
That's to say I
think-- essentially,

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.803
I know I'm present biased today.

00:35:45.803 --> 00:35:49.900
But I think I'm an exponential
discounter in the future.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.570
OK, so that's to say
I know I have self

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.010
control problems right now.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.200
But next week surely
will be different.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.510
Like this is like in the
beginning of the semester,

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.850
you know you kind of like
screwed up in the past.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.950
But this semester will
be very different.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.390
You'll be virtuous and so on.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.750
That happens kind
of every semester.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.790
So that's beta hat equals 1.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.370
So the person does not realize
that she will change her mind.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.070
She thinks that she's going to
follow through with her plan.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.320
Her plan is to do
it in T equals 1.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.990
She thinks she's going
to follow through.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.740
There will be surprises
about present bias

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.990
because you think you're
going to do it in period one.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.350
Period one arrives, and
surprise, she's present biased.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.150
She misestimated what
she's going to do

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.830
and then ends up
sort of not doing it

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.020
and has to do it
then in period two.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.670
There's a sort of
like false optimism,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.490
if you want, about future
plans and sort of the attitude

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:37.852
of this time is different.

00:36:37.852 --> 00:36:40.060
From tomorrow onwards, things
will be very different.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.690
We'll be all virtuous
in the future.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.580
And then the second
part is sort of like--

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.170
call it like perfect
sophistication.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.150
That's bets hat equals beta.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.848
That is essentially
rational expectation

00:36:50.848 --> 00:36:53.140
in a sense-- this is a person
who perfectly understands

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.100
their preferences.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.150
I know I have seen
this movie before.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.780
I know tomorrow I'm
going to procrastinate,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.670
or I'm going to
be present biased.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.590
I perfectly understand
what I'm going to do.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.710
And therefore I take
into account that when

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.380
making choices right now.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.320
And so she understands perfectly
that she will change her mind.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.360
So she understands that she has
plans to do it in period one.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.985
But she understands
that the period one

00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:17.560
self has different preferences.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.900
The period one self prefers
to do it in period two

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.700
rather than in period one.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.320
So she's kind of like, in
some sense, sort of correctly

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.210
pessimistic about
her future self.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.030
And sort of then in the case
of these kinds of investment

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.030
goods, that's a good
thing, because she doesn't

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.030
sort of leave stuff out.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.400
She doesn't delay things
a lot for the future.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.590
She doesn't let things
get bad because she knows

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.140
if she procrastinates
further, she'd

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.850
rather do it right
now, anticipating

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.430
that the future self
will not follow through.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.350
And here in the perfect
sophistication case,

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.410
there will be no surprises.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.140
The person always follows
through with their plans.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.330
The third case I'm going
to talk about next week

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.220
is when beta hat equals--

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.140
is between beta and
one, which is we

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.920
call a partial sophistication
or partial naivety.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.140
So it's a little more
complicated, but in fact,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.130
quite similar.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.338
I think there was a question.

00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:08.308
Yeah.

00:38:08.308 --> 00:38:11.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:11.284 --> 00:38:14.260
But the future self
actually can [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:18.420
FRANK SCHILBACH:
Sorry, say that again?

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.000
AUDIENCE: So the
person does not realize

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.984
that she will change
her mind over the course

00:38:22.984 --> 00:38:28.285
of the semester, but she
[INAUDIBLE] her plans.

00:38:28.285 --> 00:38:29.660
FRANK SCHILBACH:
So you would not

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.097
sort of-- so you wouldn't
really carry-- so if you change

00:38:32.097 --> 00:38:33.680
your mind in the
future, you would not

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.188
carry through with your plans.

00:38:37.188 --> 00:38:40.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.750
FRANK SCHILBACH: So either
she will change her mind

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.420
in the future or not.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.420
So if she doesn't change
her mind in the future,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.003
there's no problem, because then
there is nothing to be aware.

00:38:50.003 --> 00:38:53.110
That's kind of like the case
of the exponential discounter.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.240
So if beta hat-- sorry, if beta
is actually one to start with,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.525
which is kind of like
exponential discounting,

00:38:58.525 --> 00:39:00.400
then there's no problem
because in the future

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.680
she will just want the
same as in the present.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.160
So then sort of by construction
or by sort of assumption,

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.550
then beta hat equals
beta equals 1.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.190
And now if she changes
her mind in the future

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.140
about her preferences--
essentially

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.220
if her beta is smaller than
1, then the question arises,

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.090
what's the beta hat?

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.080
Is it like one?

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.540
That's the perfect
sophistication case.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.600
Or is it beta, which is--

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.630
beta hat equals beta.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.540
That's the perfect
sophistication case.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.580
Or if beta hat equals 1,
that's the full naivete case.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.330
And then there's sort
of cases in between,

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.510
where she sort of-- she does
understand that the beta is

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.270
smaller than 1 in the future,
but doesn't fully understand

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.190
that and underestimates--

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:48.220
overestimates her beta, but
at least only to some extent.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.701
Any other questions?

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.010
OK.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.870
So now when we sort
of look at now,

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.640
what does a naive
student actually do?

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.080
So what does the naive
student do at T equals zero?

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.550
Well, from above,
we sort of know

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.720
that the self zero prefers to do
the problem set at T equals 1.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.120
So since she's naive,
she thinks she's

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.950
going to follow through
with those plans.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.460
So she believes that she will
actually do it at T equals 1.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.717
So she doesn't do
it at T equals 0.

00:40:17.717 --> 00:40:19.300
Now, of course, what
does she actually

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.430
do at period T equals 1?

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.640
We already said that.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.640
She does actually not
want to do the period in T

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.330
equals 1, the p set
at period T equals 1.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.360
So then hence the person sort of
surprises herself and actually

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.580
ends up doing it in period two.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.010
Right.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.760
And so what's sort of
the summary of that?

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.770
And this is a more
general phenomenon.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.890
If you read the paper
for class today,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.380
that's sort of much more
general in that paper

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.660
and you could do that in a
much more complicated way.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.890
So essentially, there is
the belief in period zero--

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.840
she thinks, well, I can
not do it right now.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.830
I can delay it.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.930
The cost of delaying it
will not be that large

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.928
because I'm going to
just do it in period one.

00:40:57.928 --> 00:40:59.470
But it turns out
the cost of delaying

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.330
is actually much larger,
because in period one,

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.140
she doesn't do it.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.497
She'll do it in period two.

00:41:03.497 --> 00:41:05.080
Now, if you had more
and more periods,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.630
you could sort of have a whole
cascade of doing it every day--

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.672
every day you say you're
going to do it tomorrow,

00:41:09.672 --> 00:41:11.480
but you're never
actually going to do it.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.930
And so that can lead to
actually very large costs

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.990
of procrastination, because you
can essentially delay things

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.000
infinitely by
every time thinking

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.870
you're going to do
it in the future.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.738
And so that kind of behavior
might persist for a long time.

00:41:24.738 --> 00:41:26.530
And it's sort of an
example, as we call it,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.995
like naive procrastination.

00:41:27.995 --> 00:41:29.620
Every day you think--
or every week you

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.810
think you're going to do it
tomorrow or next week and so

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.310
on.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.280
But you're never going
to actually do it.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.873
And then that can lead to
really large welfare costs,

00:41:37.873 --> 00:41:40.290
because there's stuff that's
actually not that hard to do.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.410
But you just don't
do it every day

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.240
and it gets more and
more costly over time.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.750
And you never end up doing it.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.770
And it's way worse to do
it in 50 periods from now.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.270
You could have just
done it early on

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.240
if you had understood
that you were not

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.650
going to do it any time soon.

00:41:56.353 --> 00:41:57.270
Any questions on that?

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.650
Yeah.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:01.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what's
the interplay between learning

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.790
and sophistication [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.190
What type of people [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:15.605 --> 00:42:16.480
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.970
So one big question is,
how is this even possible

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:19.720
that we have here?

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.270
Here's a person who
keeps surprising herself

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.000
every period.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.640
I mean, like, OK, actually, I
thought I was going to do it.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.557
But surprise, I'm actually
not going to do it.

00:42:26.557 --> 00:42:29.002
But I'll tomorrow I'll do it.

00:42:29.002 --> 00:42:31.210
In a way, that's sort of
surprising, in the sense of,

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.380
like, there are these
behaviors-- like, for example,

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.047
when people think
about-- when do people

00:42:35.047 --> 00:42:36.970
go to bed, for example?

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.730
And people think
people systematically

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.770
under invest in sleep.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.570
And in some sense,
it's an odd sort

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.027
of behavior in the sense of,
you go to bed every night.

00:42:47.027 --> 00:42:49.360
You kind of know that you're
going to be tired tomorrow.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.340
Yet, every day you sort
of have this belief

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.545
that tomorrow
you'll be just fine.

00:42:53.545 --> 00:42:56.030
And from tomorrow,
things will not change.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.780
So there are some behaviors
that people tend to not learn.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.510
And we don't quite
understand why that is.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.720
In general, sort of like
learning about beta hat

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.590
is sort of--

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.200
kind of like at the frontier
of research right now.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.090
People have started
estimating beta hat.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.980
They have found people
tend to be fairly

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.227
naive in various situations.

00:43:14.227 --> 00:43:16.060
But then the question
is, how is it possible

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.340
that people are so naive
in situations where, like--

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.660
we're going to the gym.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.390
Every week you're going to have
the choice of going to the gym.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.430
You should have
learned by now what

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.573
your type is, in some
sense, what your beta is.

00:43:26.573 --> 00:43:28.240
And you should have
sort of then updated

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.510
your beliefs accordingly and
sort of changed your decisions.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.490
But somehow people
have not done that.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.098
And people tend to be
naive in situations

00:43:36.098 --> 00:43:38.140
where really they have
lots of situations or lots

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.510
of occasions to learn.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.260
Similarly, if you think
about problem sets

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.790
that you're doing,
in some ways you

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.180
know at the beginning of
the semester kind of what's

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.690
going to happen, in some ways.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.150
We should now.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.490
Yet, people tend to
be overoptimistic

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.510
in various cases.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.340
I was an undergrad
advisor for a while.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.058
And I was sort of advising
students on course choices.

00:43:57.058 --> 00:43:58.600
Every semester it
was the same thing.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.570
I would say, like, four
classes are grades, and so on.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.850
Students would take,
like, six or seven.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:08.290
And then I would say, well, you
know, that tends to not end up

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:08.980
very well.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.230
Students are like, no, no, no.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.270
This semester is different.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.520
I'm going to work really hard.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.320
It's going to be all great.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.050
And then a month
later, we would meet.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.800
And then we would go
down to five classes.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.523
And I'd be like, well, maybe
four classes are also fine.

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.650
They're like, no, no, no, no.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:21.640
Five classes are great.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.100
And then at the end, we
end up at four or three.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.340
So in a way, there are
a bunch of behaviors

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.390
that repeat over time.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.807
And in some sense,
you would still

00:44:29.807 --> 00:44:31.630
think, why are
people not learning?

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.338
One explanation why people
don't learn is in some sense,

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:35.380
they don't want to learn.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.780
In the sense of like,
I like to be a person.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.520
I like to think of
myself as a person who

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.940
is virtuous, who is hardworking,
who is going to be really doing

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.600
great at classes and so on.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.100
So I want to be that person.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.610
I feel better about
myself by wanting that.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.280
And therefore, I might not
learn as much as I could,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.905
even though that's
costly for me to do.

00:44:52.905 --> 00:44:54.697
And we're going to talk
a little about this

00:44:54.697 --> 00:44:57.340
in terms of overconfidence and
so on, where essentially people

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.750
have motivated
beliefs and people

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:01.900
want to be the person
with beta equals 1.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.170
But in fact, they might not be.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.340
OK.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.680
So now what does the
sophisticated student do?

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.020
We already discussed that.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.868
Essentially, the
person already knows.

00:45:12.868 --> 00:45:14.410
The person has
rational expectations.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:17.020
So the person knows that if she
doesn't do it in period zero,

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.645
she's not going to
do it in period one,

00:45:18.645 --> 00:45:21.160
because the period one self
will change their minds

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.870
and not follow through
with her plans.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.730
So she's going to
do it in period two.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.335
Now anticipating
that for a choice

00:45:26.335 --> 00:45:28.210
is essentially, effectively,
between doing it

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.700
right now versus in period two.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.411
That's the effective
choice that she has.

00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:36.220
And we can now just
make the choice.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.980
Does she prefer doing it
period zero versus period two?

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.860
Well, she prefers doing
it in period zero,

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.930
because period two is
too costly for her,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.880
even if that's in the future.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.400
And therefore, she does
the problem set at period T

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.570
equals zero.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.260
OK.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.537
Any questions?

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:57.640
OK.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.530
So what's the summary of that?

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:04.390
Well, the sophisticated student,
for a case of investment goods,

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.370
the person knows that if she
delays, she'll delay even more.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.950
So once you start
procrastinating,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.120
you know this is
going to unravel.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.537
I'm never going
to actually do it.

00:46:11.537 --> 00:46:13.460
And anticipating that,
she's going to say,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.920
well, I'd rather
do it right now,

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.280
because I know this
is going to unravel

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.988
or this is going to
derail in the future.

00:46:17.988 --> 00:46:20.512
I'd rather not have to do
it very late, late at night,

00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:21.470
and so on and so forth.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.290
So let me do it right now.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.040
So that student in
that specific case

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.930
does better than
the naive student.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:32.140
And for the case of
investment goods,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.090
sophisticated
procrastination does not

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.410
cause large welfare costs.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.530
It's not possible for a
perfectly sophisticated person

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.430
to procrastinate things for
a long time and sort of lead

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.250
to a very inefficient or
costly outcomes, the reason

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.890
being if you know that's going
to be costly in the future,

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.490
if it's really that bad, you
would rather do it right now.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.980
And so therefore,
they cannot be--

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.608
there can be some
costs of delaying.

00:46:55.608 --> 00:46:58.150
You might do it tomorrow-- you
might do it a little bit later

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.920
than optimally.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.800
But it cannot be that you
procrastinated for a long time

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.110
and never do it and therefore
get like really large costs

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:06.610
of that.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.290
OK.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:17.275
So one question that also
came up in the online forum

00:47:17.275 --> 00:47:18.650
that you also saw
in the readings

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:20.670
that we're going to also talk a
little bit about in the problem

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.980
set is, well, is
sophistication always good?

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.170
And it's very intuitive to
think that sophistication always

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:26.670
helps.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:29.040
After all, knowing
things better,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.242
having correct beliefs
about yourself,

00:47:31.242 --> 00:47:32.700
that seems to be
the correct thing.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.980
So intuitively, it feels
like that should only help,

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.070
should only make things better.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.470
If I understood
my biases better,

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.720
I should be doing better.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.563
Now, it turns out that's
true for investment goods.

00:47:42.563 --> 00:47:43.980
So for investment
goods, these are

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.313
the goods where you have to
do something in the present,

00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:48.660
but the costs-- sorry, the
benefits are in the future.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.280
For that,
sophistication is always

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.320
better, or weakly
better, the reason

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.660
being that, again, you
can sort of understand

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.190
your future misbehavior.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.740
And by that understanding
of future misbehavior,

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.500
you can sort of avoid bad
things happening in the future

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.820
by doing it right
now and earlier.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.960
So in that case, sophistication
is always better.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.520
Now, it turns out
for leisure goods,

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.820
that's actually not the case.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.640
So leisure goods,
again, are goods

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.890
where you can enjoy
something in the present

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:17.590
and there may be some costs
delayed in the future.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:22.740
And so let's look at-- and this
is very close to now the paper

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.390
that you read.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:25.770
Suppose there's
a student who has

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.920
beta equals 1/2 and delta
equals 1, as before.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.730
Suppose the student can go
to only one movie in exactly

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:33.810
one of the four periods.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.643
There's only one movie
ticket that she could

00:48:35.643 --> 00:48:37.313
use in period 0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:48:37.313 --> 00:48:39.480
By the way, Matthew Rabin
is a huge Johnny Depp fan,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.000
in case you haven't noticed.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.520
So he uses Johnny Depp
in various of his papers,

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.520
and so on.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.100
He also had a huge Johnny
Depp poster in his office.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.590
So the instantaneous
utilities are

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:57.880
such that they're 1, 3/4,
9/4, and 27/8, so they're

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.850
sort of increasing over time.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:01.830
So if you-- so
there's essentially

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.287
one day where it's like the
most fun to watch the movie,

00:49:04.287 --> 00:49:06.120
perhaps because you can
go with your friends

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.610
or whatever-- like, it's
a better day to do it.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.160
Maybe you're a bit better
rested or whatever it is.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.028
But sort of delaying
would be good.

00:49:13.028 --> 00:49:15.570
Now, the problem, of course, is
that the person is impatient.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.620
The person might not want to
wait because the person is

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.245
present biased.

00:49:18.245 --> 00:49:19.958
He might want to
watch it earlier.

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.750
The question now is,
when does she actually

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.880
go watch that movie?

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.810
So now there's a way in which
you can sort of write this down

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:32.340
in a very simple form, which
is a table of discounted

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:32.850
utilities.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.857
That's a simple tool for
solving these kinds of problems.

00:49:35.857 --> 00:49:37.440
This is supposed to
come sequentially,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.435
but it isn't today,
it's on something that's

00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:40.560
already filled out for you.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.040
So that's easier for you.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.550
So what I have filled
out for you here

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.860
is the instantaneous utility.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.050
So the first row
here is essentially

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.450
to say, these are sort of
the assumptions that we have.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.033
You have the
instantaneous utilities--

00:49:53.033 --> 00:49:56.022
U0, U1, UT, U3, and so on.

00:49:56.022 --> 00:49:57.480
So this is essentially
what you see

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.910
on the first row of this table.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.700
Second then I filled out for
you sort of the utilities

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.880
from the perspective of period
zero, period one, and period

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.230
two.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.880
So from the
perspective of T equals

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.070
0, the first period T equals
0 equals just the same.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.585
That's just 1, because she
puts weight one on that.

00:50:14.585 --> 00:50:15.960
But then everything
in the future

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.460
is discounted by 1/2,
because the beta is 1/2.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.120
Yes?

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.040
And then from the
perspective of T

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.652
equals 1, of course T equals
0 is sort of irrelevant

00:50:27.652 --> 00:50:28.860
because that was in the past.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.440
By definition, we
only care about stuff

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.023
that happens in the
future, because we

00:50:32.023 --> 00:50:32.965
can't change the past.

00:50:32.965 --> 00:50:34.340
Notice that's also
an assumption,

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.590
but it's a common assumption
made in economics.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.860
So there 3/2 now
is in the present.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.180
So that gets weight 1.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.560
And everything that's in
the future gets weight 1/2.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.180
So you have 9/8 and 27/16.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.670
And now for period 2 again--

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.310
period now 0 and
1 are in the past.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.260
Now she cares about
the present [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.480
T equals 2 with the weight of 1.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.470
That's 9/4.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:00.110
And now T equals 3
is in the future.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.200
That's discounted by 1/2.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:02.960
OK.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.520
And now what I also
have done, I've

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.610
written down the ranking
of these different periods

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.050
from the perspective of--

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.965
from the sort of just looking
at the instantaneous utilities,

00:51:11.965 --> 00:51:13.340
three's better
than two is better

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.290
than one is better than zero.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.770
From the perspective of T equals
0, you prefer three over two

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.180
over zero over one.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.700
From T equals 1, you prefer
three over one over two.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.590
And from the perspective
of T equals 2,

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.080
you prefer two over three.

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.696
Does this all make sense
what I've written down here?

00:51:29.696 --> 00:51:31.330
I'll let you look at
this for a second.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.410
OK.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:40.320
So what does the naive person
do with beta hat equals 1?

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.140
Yes.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.950
AUDIENCE: Oh, wait, hold on.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.108
FRANK SCHILBACH: We can
do this step by step.

00:51:57.108 --> 00:51:58.960
AUDIENCE: OK, so
[INAUDIBLE] zero.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.900
And then from the
perspective of T equals 0,

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.980
you would most prefer to
do something at time three.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.480
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.280
AUDIENCE: So I guess
that means that you

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.164
don't do it in period one and
then move on to T equals 1.

00:52:11.164 --> 00:52:13.164
And then again you want
to do it in period three

00:52:13.164 --> 00:52:15.840
so you don't do it
in period one here.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.400
And then you end
up at T equals 2.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.205
And then you'd rather do it in
period two than period three,

00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:22.330
so you do it in period two.

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:22.650
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:23.190
Correct.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.770
So let me do that
in slow motion.

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:29.600
So in period T, she
makes some plans.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.640
You wrote down what is her
preferred plan in period

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.810
T equals zero.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.730
We have our ranking
at the very right

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.980
in the right-- in the
last column on the right.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.720
She prefers to do
it in period three.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.670
She thinks that she's going to
follow through with her plans.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:44.580
So she's not going
to do it in period 0

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.590
because she thinks she
prefers period three.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.390
So let's just wait.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:55.800
So she doesn't go in
in periods T equals 0.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.120
And period T equals
1 is the same thing.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.180
And now she essentially
says, well, she

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.980
prefers three over one over two.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.490
It's better to do
it in period three

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.970
so let's just wait
until period three.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:07.710
Now, of course,
period two comes.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.680
Once period two
comes, it turns out

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.160
we cooked up the number such
as like prefers a period

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.450
two over period three.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:18.300
So she surprises herself by
actually watching the movie

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.440
in period two.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.950
OK.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.242
Any questions?

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:27.640
OK.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.160
So now instead, what does
a sophisticated student do?

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:36.220
So this was the perfectly naive
student doing it and watching

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.540
the movie in period two.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.740
No, if you're sophisticated,
what do you do?

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:40.928
Yes.

00:53:40.928 --> 00:53:43.060
AUDIENCE: She starts
thinking that if she waits,

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.235
[INAUDIBLE] equals 2,
she's going to at two--

00:53:47.235 --> 00:53:48.714
wait.

00:53:48.714 --> 00:53:50.193
FRANK SCHILBACH: Correct.

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.668
AUDIENCE: So then she
knows that at T equals 1,

00:53:52.668 --> 00:53:53.960
she's not going wait until two.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.640
She's going to--

00:54:03.647 --> 00:54:04.730
FRANK SCHILBACH: Any help?

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:05.230
Yes, OK.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:16.970
AUDIENCE: So first student,
at T equals 2, she would go.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:24.190
So if she were at T equals 1,
she knows that if she waits,

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:30.160
then she would go at
two instead of three.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.190
But she likes one.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:35.860
So her choice is not
between one and three,

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.930
but between one and two.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:42.250
So if she were at time period
one, then she would go--

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:43.720
choose to go at one.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.250
And then if she's
at time T equals 0,

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:53.810
her choice is going to be
between zero and one, not zero

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:54.310
and three.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:58.840
So that if she were
at time period zero,

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.248
she would just end up
going at time period zero.

00:55:01.248 --> 00:55:02.290
FRANK SCHILBACH: Correct.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.930
So let me also say that
a little slower again.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.130
So if we look at
perfectly naive people,

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:12.520
they're going to start from
the beginning and go forwards.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.400
We have a naive person who
has plans going forward.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.620
And then we just look at
how does this plan evolve?

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.920
So you start at how
does this person person

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.910
decide at period T
equals zero, thinking

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.160
she's going to follow through?

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.750
Then we go to
period one thinking

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:26.740
she's going to follow through.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.060
Then we go to
period two thinking

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.310
she's going to follow through.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.150
And that's how we sort
of solve the problem.

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.057
Now, for the
sophisticated person,

00:55:34.057 --> 00:55:35.390
you would do things differently.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.682
We essentially do this
backwards deduction, essentially

00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:39.610
to say let's start
at the very end.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.980
The reason that we can
use backwards induction

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.260
is because people have
rational expectations.

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.410
The person knows exactly
what she's going to do,

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:47.680
which is she's going
to start from the end

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.472
and say, OK, how is
this going to play out?

00:55:49.472 --> 00:55:51.100
What am I going
to do in the end?

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.080
And sort of anticipating
that perfectly, we're

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.510
going to then solve backwards.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:00.503
OK, so as you just
said, in period two,

00:56:00.503 --> 00:56:02.920
we know that she's going to
go, if she hasn't, because she

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.125
prefers two over three.

00:56:04.125 --> 00:56:05.500
That's the last
row that we have.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.970
She likes two better than three
once she comes to period two.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.350
Now, in period T
equals 1, she knows

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.350
that she's not going to
wait until period three.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.270
So period three is actually
not an option for her.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.500
She knows that's not credible.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.920
She's not going
to follow through.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.370
So then it's just a choice
between one and two.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:22.780
She prefers one over two.

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.660
So she's going to--

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.220
going in period one.

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.470
Now then, in period
one two equals 0,

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.090
now we know-- she
realized that she

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.945
won't wait until two or three.

00:56:32.945 --> 00:56:34.570
Two or three are not
an option for her.

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.510
She would actually prefer
both two and three.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.910
But that's not possible because
her future self will not

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.440
stick to her choice.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.610
So then the choice really just
becomes between zero and one,

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.312
and she prefers zero over one.

00:56:48.312 --> 00:56:50.020
Now, essentially, she
goes to that movie,

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.940
and gets a trilogy of one.

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.568
But actually, she would prefer
any of these other outcomes--

00:56:54.568 --> 00:56:56.110
actually, any of
her other self would

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:57.550
prefer her to not do that.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.580
But she actually
picks period one.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.290
So that's an example.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.820
And there's several
examples of that

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.910
where sophistication can hurt.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.800
Now, why is sophistication
hurting here?

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.470
What's the key
part, and why is it

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:15.250
worse for the student
to be sophisticated?

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.750
In some sense, if
you think about it

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:20.560
from the perspective
of T equals 0,

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.830
she would prefer a three
over two over zero over one.

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.700
Or overall, if you look at
the instantaneous utilities,

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.450
period two is better.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.220
So from the perspective
of T equals 0,

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.400
period two is better
than period zero.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.630
Yet, he ends up
going in period zero.

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.480
So a sophisticated
person actually

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.340
would be better off
if she were naive.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.470
If she could sort of commit
to something and say,

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:45.250
I would prefer to go in
period two, if she could say--

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.200
if I only could be
naive, that would sort of

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.060
help her to actually
do it in period two.

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.330
Of course, you can't
sort of choose that.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.930
But here she's worse off
from being sophisticated.

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.040
But what's going on here?

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.532
Like, why is that happening?

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.620
Yes.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.650
AUDIENCE: So she almost
mistrusts her future self

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.980
and so preempts that by
taking the previous decision.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.600
But then also
preempting that, she

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.400
would preempt her future self.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.250
She would take the
previous decision again.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.475
And so that makes it so
that she does the action

00:58:21.475 --> 00:58:24.130
at the very start instead.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:27.010
For us, the naive person
always blunders through

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.530
and manages to take the more--

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.982
the action with
the higher utility.

00:58:31.982 --> 00:58:32.940
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:38.800
So in some ways, the problem is
set up in a way that, in a way,

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.380
realistic pessimism--
the sophisticated person

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.300
is, like, realistic
in their pessimism.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.570
She knows, essentially,
that in the future

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:48.290
she's not going to behave.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.180
So she would love to wait.

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.770
But what she needs
to do to wait,

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.550
she needs to have a sufficiently
high benefit of waiting.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.440
Now, how high is the
benefit of waiting?

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.900
It depends on what your
future self is going to do.

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.840
If you only wait a little
bit, the person will say,

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.970
if I go-- if the choice
is between zero and one,

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:04.928
it's not worth waiting.

00:59:04.928 --> 00:59:06.620
I might as well go right now.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.550
So if I can wrongly sort of
have the illusion to myself

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.340
that I say, well,
I'm going to not

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.750
go in one, or in two, for that
matter, then in some sense

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:19.600
the benefits of waiting-- the
perceived benefits of waiting

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.470
are higher than
they actually are.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.820
And in this case, it mitigates
the self-control problem

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.630
or the present bias.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.630
The present bias person
wants to do it right now

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:32.140
and needs a sufficiently
high reward for waiting.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.270
So if you can sort of perceive--

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.100
if you can sort of
deceive yourself

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.450
into thinking that the
rewards of waiting are high,

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:39.700
you're going to actually wait.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.760
And that's good for
you in this case.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.023
If, instead, you're realistic
about your future self,

00:59:45.023 --> 00:59:47.440
you know that waiting is not
really helping you very much.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.050
You know that essentially,
if you wait for one period,

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:52.300
you're going to go and go
in the next period, anyway.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.300
So then the reward--

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.800
and that's in part because the
numbers are set up that way--

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.807
but that's now essentially
sort of telling you,

00:59:58.807 --> 01:00:00.640
well, waiting is not
really doing very much,

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.100
because your future self
is also misbehaving.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.190
It sort of makes it
impossible to actually wait

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.525
all the way until the very end.

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:10.900
And therefore, it sort of
makes the self-control problem,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.850
the present bias,
worse, because now it's

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:16.270
like it's not worth-- why even
bother to wait a little bit,

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:18.280
because that's literally
not worth doing?

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.150
Really what you would need
is wait all the way through.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.153
Yeah.

01:00:22.153 --> 01:00:23.986
AUDIENCE: So I think
this is related to what

01:00:23.986 --> 01:00:25.470
I was trying to ask before.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.676
If you're sophisticated, you
know you have [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:28.676 --> 01:00:30.100
If you are in
period zero, you'll

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.550
know that on the next
period, you're [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.090
So why would you prefer to
experience [INAUDIBLE] one now

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.920
[INAUDIBLE] experience
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:48.892 --> 01:00:51.820
FRANK SCHILBACH: No,
but I think it's--

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.902
in a way, there is
a preference over--

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:56.860
and something like that's,
again, an assumption

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.060
how people behave.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.930
People care a lot
about the present.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.160
And that's sort of
like, in some sense,

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.243
in a bunch of experiments
and so on, people really

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:05.560
want stuff right
now, even if they

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.790
know that they will prefer
stuff in two days from now

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.300
or three days from
now and so on.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.050
You just-- you are
impatient right now.

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:16.780
And that's what the
utility function is like.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.610
And so you put less weight on
stuff that's in the future.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.858
Now, if you sort think about
your future preferences,

01:01:22.858 --> 01:01:25.150
there's a question on-- that's
a philosophical question

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.067
in some ways-- how do
you think about the fact

01:01:27.067 --> 01:01:29.260
that your future self
wants something different?

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.860
That is to say, for example,
if I want to exercise a lot

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.640
and I also like to sit on
the couch and watch TV a lot,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.270
now my current self wants to
exercise a lot in the future.

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.700
My future self wants
to-- and I know that--

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.290
wants to sit on the couch.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.443
Now the question
is which-- and when

01:01:46.443 --> 01:01:47.860
you think about
welfare and so on,

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.573
which self should we respect?

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:51.490
And one assumption-- and
this is an assumption

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:55.270
that's built in here-- is
to say my current self has

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.652
certain plans for the future.

01:01:56.652 --> 01:01:58.360
And those preferences
are the preferences

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.250
that I'm using to maximize.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.650
I know that my future
self wants other things.

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:05.650
But in some sense, I'm assuming
I know that I know better.

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:08.590
This is the utility function
that counts is the current one,

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:10.030
not the future one.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:12.070
And so then I respect
that one and I'm

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.040
trying to maximize
that sort of subject

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.520
to my future preferences
being different.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.187
But in some sense,
you're exactly right.

01:02:20.187 --> 01:02:21.645
If you think about,
like, should we

01:02:21.645 --> 01:02:23.230
tax potato chips, for example--

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:24.880
talk about welfare and so on--

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.330
should we tax potato chips?

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.040
You could say, well,
on the one hand,

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.077
I might say I would like
to tax potato chips,

01:02:30.077 --> 01:02:31.660
because I know in
the future I'm going

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.100
to eat too many potato chips.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.630
That's good for me.

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.100
But there's a future self--

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.590
actually, myself-- who would
love to eat potato chips.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:40.900
That self would
be really unhappy.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.420
Now you get very tricky
questions of welfare

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.130
and a sense of
saying, like, well,

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.870
who are we to say
that the current self

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.420
is different or should get
priority over the future self?

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.820
The future self will
really be unhappy.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.250
So there are different
views on this.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.950
Some people, including Matthew
Rabin including David Laibson

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.367
and so on, would
sort of say, what

01:02:58.367 --> 01:03:00.670
counts is the current
self, or a self

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.077
that chooses for the future.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:03.910
That's sort of the
virtue of self and so on.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.340
We should use that for
welfare evaluation.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.542
That's an assumption.

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:10.000
There's other people who would
argue that no, like, there's

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.740
all sorts of self who
want different things.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.615
So if you think about,
is it good to increase

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:15.400
taxes for potato chips?

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.530
Maybe, because some
selves are better off

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:18.942
and some selves are worse off.

01:03:18.942 --> 01:03:21.400
And how do we ever aggregate
across those different selves?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.210
So you get very
tricky questions.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.210
But here for our purposes
what we're going to do

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.550
is we're going to say the
current self is essentially

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:30.820
disrespecting future
utility functions

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.580
and preferences in
the own maximization

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.960
and the maximization problem.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.450
That is to say, I have a
utility function right now,

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:40.270
and sort of discounting
function that tells me

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:44.260
how I want to aggregate my
future utility over time.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.920
That is what I want.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.000
And then I have essentially like
a-- sort of like constraints

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.460
which are coming sort of in
the-- when I think about sort

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.088
of like when you write down a
utility maximization problem,

01:03:54.088 --> 01:03:56.380
there's an objective function,
which is my maximization

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:56.880
problem.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.110
That's the utility function
that I want right now.

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.180
And then there's constraints
in your maximization

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.220
problem, which
are in the future,

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.760
my preferences will change.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.430
So some options
might not be feasible

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:09.122
because of these preference
reversals, and so on.

01:04:09.122 --> 01:04:10.080
But that's not to say--

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.610
I'm respecting your future
preferences to the extent

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:15.070
that I need to have
feasible plans.

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:16.960
I'm not respecting
them in the sense of,

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.070
like, I know right now.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.691
I know better what's
good for myself.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.060
Did that answer your question?

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.840
OK.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.372
Any other-- yeah.

01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:26.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.730
FRANK SCHILBACH: Sorry, what
exactly is the question?

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:42.720
AUDIENCE: So does that mean that
if you go see the movie in T

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.580
equals 2, do you evaluate
that as-- sorry, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.050
FRANK SCHILBACH: So from the
perspective of period T equals

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:52.870
2, you evaluate it with 9/4.

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:54.970
From the perspective
of period T equals

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.560
1 or T equals 0, that
is in the future.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.230
So you multiply
the 9/4 times 1/2,

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.167
which is the beta because
it's in the future.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.125
AUDIENCE: So then when
you say the student does

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:07.320
better [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:12.545 --> 01:05:14.920
FRANK SCHILBACH: I'm using
sort of from that perspective.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.553
So in some sense, that's a bit
of a question philosophically,

01:05:17.553 --> 01:05:20.220
what's better and worse, because
you have different perspective.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.770
You can take from the
perspective of T equals 0--

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.750
for example, a
sophisticated person

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.615
would much prefer period
two over period zero, one

01:05:28.615 --> 01:05:30.210
over zero.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:33.120
So I just showed you that
the sophisticated person

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.340
goes in period zero.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.340
But in fact, the person
would prefer a three and two.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.110
So the outcome of
the naive person

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:43.030
would be better for the
sophisticated person

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.830
from the perspective
of T equals 0.

01:05:48.613 --> 01:05:50.280
And so then there's
a bit of a question.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.200
From the perspective
of t equals 2,

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.333
if you had gone already
in the previous period,

01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.250
probably prefer if you
hadn't gone previously.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.740
But that's a bit
silly, in some sense.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.230
But you can essentially-- you
can write down for each self,

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.880
what would each self prefer?

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.760
And I think as it is in this
example, it's essentially,

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.400
the sophisticated essentially
does worse for all selves

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.980
compared to a-- weakly worse
compared to the naive person.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.250
OK, but happy to talk after.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.830
OK, so I think we
have all of that.

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.540
Sophistication can
make things worse.

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.930
So now overall let me--

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.830
so more generally,
the lessons are--

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:29.820
so the question is kind of
like whether future misbehavior

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.090
raises or lowers the cost
of current misbehavior.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.890
So essentially, whether
future and current misbehavior

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:39.755
are compliments or substitutes--
so if future misbehavior raises

01:06:39.755 --> 01:06:41.130
the costs of
current misbehavior,

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.100
then sophistication helps
in overcoming short run

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.150
impatience.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:47.085
That tends to be true
for investment goods.

01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:48.960
That was the example
that I showed you first.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.700
If I know I'm going to
misbehave in the future,

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.420
I'm not going to like--

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.090
I'm going to procrastinate a
lot if I don't do it right now.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.680
Then sophistication
is good because I

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.490
can sort of prevent that by
just doing stuff right now.

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:02.133
So those are the investment
goods with immediate cost.

01:07:02.133 --> 01:07:03.550
There are some
exceptions to that.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.550
But generally, that
tends to be true.

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:07.650
Now, if instead
future misbehavior

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.230
lowers the costs of
current misbehavior,

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.985
because essentially the
benefits of waiting in this case

01:07:13.985 --> 01:07:16.110
that I showed you for the
movie are just lower now,

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:19.117
so the costs of misbehaving now
have become lower, then I say,

01:07:19.117 --> 01:07:20.700
well, I might as
well do it right now.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.500
I might as well eat the
cake right now, or whatever.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.770
There's no point in waiting.

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.380
So then sophistication hurts
in overcoming short run

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.300
impatience.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:31.590
And that tends to be the
case for leisure goods.

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.050
So avoid immediate rewards.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.054
Now-- yes?

01:07:36.054 --> 01:07:37.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:45.835
FRANK SCHILBACH: It has to--

01:07:45.835 --> 01:07:46.710
it's a little tricky.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:47.752
It's kind of complicated.

01:07:47.752 --> 01:07:50.150
In some sense, it has to
do with specific cases.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:53.060
But the key question
is essentially is like,

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:57.740
in the future, does
sophistication or misbehavior

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.750
raise or lower the costs
of future misbehavior?

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:04.370
Does it raise or lower the
costs of current misbehavior?

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.580
And then depending on whether
that's the case, sophistication

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.700
or naivete go in
different directions.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.140
So essentially there's
a true answer to that.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.450
And then essentially if
you're naive to this,

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:17.330
it sort of flips the direction,
depending on the numbers.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:19.365
But it's more
complicated to that.

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:21.740
It sort of-- these are sort
of fairly general statements.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.090
So it's a little complicated.

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:25.830
But you'll see some examples
again in problem sets

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:26.330
and so on.

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:27.060
Yes.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.810
AUDIENCE: Does anybody
model [INAUDIBLE]??

01:08:32.762 --> 01:08:33.970
FRANK SCHILBACH: Not so much.

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.979
So usually people tend to-- so
that's an interesting question.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.920
So usually people think beta
hat or any preference parameters

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.899
are often independent of the
costs and choices that you see.

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:47.160
So the idea often
is you are born

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.200
with a beta and a
beta hat and a delta

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.630
and so on that fell
somehow from the sky.

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:54.342
There's some research on how
environmental factors and so

01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:55.259
on affect preferences.

01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:57.660
For example, we'll
show you some research

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.223
on how contact with
different types of people

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:01.515
affect your social preferences.

01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:05.939
For example, if you are
exposed to many poor people

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.378
as a rich person
in your life, you

01:09:07.378 --> 01:09:09.420
might become a nicer person
and things like that.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.260
I'll show you some
research about that.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.979
So there's some research on
how exposure to environments

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:15.960
affects people's preferences.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.120
In the case of time
preferences, usually people

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.220
just think by
assumption, somehow you

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.800
came with a certain
discount factor,

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.660
and that's how it is,
or beta delta and so on.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.540
That applies to all
sorts of settings.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.359
Yeah.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.760
But if it's less
costly, you should be

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.270
able to be more sophisticated.

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:42.932
So I mean--

01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:43.890
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:44.590
That's an interesting question.

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:47.130
So that's not what people
have done and thought about.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.870
In a way, there's
a bit of a question

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.910
whether your cost
and benefit structure

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:53.490
can explain your behavior
for a given beta hat.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:56.710
But it might also be that for
some case-- in some situations,

01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:58.025
you might say you want to be--

01:09:58.025 --> 01:09:59.650
for example, what I
was saying earlier,

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:01.717
it's like, why are
people not learning?

01:10:01.717 --> 01:10:03.300
For some behaviors,
maybe you actually

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.970
don't care if your beta
is 0.7 or whatever.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:06.872
It's like, fine.

01:10:06.872 --> 01:10:09.330
But some people really care
about being a good and virtuous

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:09.830
person.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:12.152
And therefore these might
be important choices in life

01:10:12.152 --> 01:10:13.860
that you would say,
I'm a serious person.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:14.460
I do this well.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.835
My beta hat--
you'd like to think

01:10:15.835 --> 01:10:19.718
of yourself as your
beta being high.

01:10:19.718 --> 01:10:21.510
That's not what people
have done very much.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.490
So there's a little
bit of research

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:26.580
of good, specific discounting,
like your discounting

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.180
for certain goods might be
different than for others,

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.930
depending on what kinds
of goods they are.

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:33.360
So some goods are temptation
goods and others are not.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.360
Even that is not really in
the mainstream of economics

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.470
very much, let alone sort of
saying your beta hat varies

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.280
by circumstance.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.613
I think that's a very nice idea.

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:46.870
I don't know any research
that has done that so far.

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:48.000
OK.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.620
So now one question
you might ask--

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.520
well, is it beneficial
to be sophisticated?

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.170
Couldn't we just all be naive
and everybody's better off?

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.780
So in theory-- at
least in principle--

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.300
it's sort of unclear whether
sophistication is good.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.070
As I told you--

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:02.320
I showed you just an example--

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.100
in some cases it's good
and other cases it's bad.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.040
If you think overall
many important decisions

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.120
or choices in life
tend to be decisions

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.830
that involve one term--

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:15.900
one time efforts that
yield future benefits,

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.220
these are investment goods.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.130
So in many cases in life, you
have sort of investment goods--

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:23.760
like finishing papers,
presentations, reports,

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.450
finding good investment
options for retirement,

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.510
quitting bad habits, quitting
smoking, finding a job,

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:31.810
and so on and so forth.

01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:33.540
So lots of choices
are essentially

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.480
immediate effort, or at
one time or several times

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.190
putting in effort right now
where you get future benefits.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:40.690
So a lot of important
things in life

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.630
tend to be investment goods.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:45.870
And in that case, I
guess sophistication

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.620
tends to be good.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.020
So essentially it helps you.

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:53.068
Now, in addition,
sophisticates take advantage

01:11:53.068 --> 01:11:53.985
of commitment devices.

01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:55.680
So I offer you a
commitment device

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.540
that I was discussing earlier.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.100
The sophisticated
person will say, great.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.600
The commitment
device might help me.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.100
Great.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.070
I'm going to demand it and might
be better off because of that.

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.350
I'm going to show you next week
commitment devices don't always

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.850
work.

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:10.240
Maybe sometimes they could
actually make things worse.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.500
But in principle, at least, you
think commitment devices could

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.500
improve things, and sort of in
that sense, being sophisticated

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.400
is good.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.140
So I think overall,
if I had to choose

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.720
if I'm sophisticated or
naive, I would probably

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.600
choose to be sophisticated,
at least in this case.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.920
Whether that's actually
true, I'm not so sure.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.520
There's one somewhat
more subtle thing here

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.100
is to say, like, is it sort
of-- is the issue here really

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:39.030
impatience or time
inconsistency-- in a sense of,

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.460
is it just about people not
caring sufficiently much

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.360
for the future?

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.050
Or is it about how important
is time inconsistency?

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.340
And as I said, some of the
behavior that I'm going to

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:48.840
show--

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.720
that I showed you is,
impatience is not really

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.950
the key issue here.

01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:55.350
It's not about people
not necessarily caring

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:58.620
about the future, but rather,
people switching their choices

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.780
and choosing dominated
options in the sense

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.580
of overall dominated.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.680
If you sort of commit,
there are some options

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.770
that you prefer that you end
up not choosing because you

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:09.300
change your choices over time.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.740
Impatience cannot create
this type of behavior.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.290
What I showed you, where the
sophisticated person says,

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.560
I would like these options
but I'm not choosing them

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.260
because I know my future
self will change their minds,

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.440
that is not possible.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.860
You cannot generate this
behavior coming from just

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.970
impatience.

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.310
A delta being 0.5 or
whatever would not

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:27.990
generate you this behavior.

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.550
What you need is
time inconsistency.

01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:33.900
You need, essentially,
preference reversals over time.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.880
OK, so then in
some ways I think--

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.810
perhaps more most practical
for your purposes, in part,

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:41.340
for the problem set--

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.080
how do we solve sort
of problems with

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.440
quasi-hyperbolic discounting?

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.820
So as I told you before,
for the naive person,

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.350
we can start from the beginning.

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.530
And why do we start from the
beginning as a naive person?

01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:55.040
Why does this work?

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.218
So I sort of showed you
already how to solve it.

01:13:57.218 --> 01:13:59.260
Now I'm sort of generalizing
that, in some sense.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.635
Why is that a
useful thing to do?

01:14:00.635 --> 01:14:01.258
Yeah.

01:14:01.258 --> 01:14:02.993
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:02.993 --> 01:14:03.910
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah.

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:06.360
So the naive person thinks,
I'm going to make plans now

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.570
for the future.

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:10.410
And by assumption,
the naive person

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.750
thinks they're going to
follow through on those plans.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.190
So what you can
essentially do is

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:17.400
you can start with
some plans, see

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.600
what the person is
choosing thinking they're

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
going to follow through.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.780
You don't have to
worry about what's

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:23.640
going to happen in the
future, because you

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.250
can explain perfectly what the
person is doing in the present

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.320
by making plans for--

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.087
sorry, by making your choice
for the future periods.

01:14:31.087 --> 01:14:32.670
You don't have to
actually worry about

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:34.170
whether the person is
going to follow through,

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.290
because the person doesn't
even think about that.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:38.020
So you say, I make a
plan for the future,

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.937
assuming I'm going to
stick through with that,

01:14:39.937 --> 01:14:40.830
or stick to this.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:42.622
And then you can just
sort of roll forwards

01:14:42.622 --> 01:14:44.460
and say, OK, I start
with period T equals 0,

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.450
make the plan for that, think
I'm going to follow through.

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.950
Surprise, maybe
period one I'm going

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.290
to do something different.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.707
But then I'm going to have the
same assumption, and so on.

01:14:51.707 --> 01:14:53.850
I can just go from T
equals 0 going forward

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:58.350
under the assumption that I'm
going to stick to those plans.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:59.790
For the sophisticated
person, that

01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:02.790
doesn't work, because a
sophisticated person knows

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.690
that if I make some
plans for the future,

01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:07.110
those might not be feasible
because the future self will

01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:09.220
misbehave and
change their plans.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.853
I know essentially that
some plans are not feasible.

01:15:12.853 --> 01:15:14.520
So what I need to do
is essentially just

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.830
start from the end and see,
OK, if certain options are

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:18.780
available, what I'm
going to do, and then

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.590
walk backwards to solve it.

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.800
And that's essentially
rational expectations

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.610
where essentially you perfectly
understand your future behavior

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.730
and sort of take into
account your future choices.

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.800
You're going to make them
current choices at the end.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.500
What about the
exponential person?

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.280
How does that person
solve the problem?

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.020
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
about what you just said.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:38.880
FRANK SCHILBACH: Go ahead.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.172
AUDIENCE: So to summarize a
sophisticated person, where

01:15:41.172 --> 01:15:43.940
they're going from the
end to the beginning,

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.690
as they move backwards, are
you just removing choices

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.030
that you know you won't ever--

01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.430
FRANK SCHILBACH: Correct.

01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.930
Exactly.

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.830
So what we did in
the movie choice,

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.530
if you go through this
example in more detail,

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.168
you'll notice that
essentially, if I know that,

01:15:57.168 --> 01:15:59.210
for example, suppose I
want to go in period three

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:00.877
but I know I'm going
to go in period two

01:16:00.877 --> 01:16:02.450
if it comes down
to that, then I'm

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:06.830
going to remove period three for
my choice set or for my options

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:09.380
when optimizing in period
one or period zero,

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.150
anticipating what I'm
going to do in the future.

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:17.390
So what about the
exponential discounter?

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.752
Yes?

01:16:19.752 --> 01:16:21.231
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:27.090
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:30.012
So there's two options, in fact,
for the exponential discounter.

01:16:30.012 --> 01:16:32.220
It actually doesn't matter
because you follow through

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.198
with your plans anyway.

01:16:33.198 --> 01:16:34.740
So you could start
from the beginning

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.070
and just walk forward.

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:38.740
In fact, what you can do is
you can start in period zero

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.902
make a plan for everything
and just follow through.

01:16:40.902 --> 01:16:42.360
You don't even have
to go to period

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.740
1, 2, and 3 because
you know you're

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.980
going to stick to that plan.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.590
So you can essentially
just do that.

01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:48.750
You could actually also
do backward transactions.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.940
And I'm pretty sure you
get the exact same answer.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.960
It doesn't matter.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.620
The much easier thing
to do, of course,

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.380
is to solve the
problem in period 0

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.570
and then just assuming you're
going to follow through.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.530
So sorry, this should
say readings for Tuesday.

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:05.650
The class is on
Tuesday, not on Monday.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:11.280
Please read the paper by
Ariely and Wortenbroch.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.850
Read the entire article.

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:15.240
We're going to discuss
applications from smoking

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.670
to drinking, setting
deadlines, and so on,

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:20.620
and apply these models
in real-world settings.

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.580
Thank you very much.

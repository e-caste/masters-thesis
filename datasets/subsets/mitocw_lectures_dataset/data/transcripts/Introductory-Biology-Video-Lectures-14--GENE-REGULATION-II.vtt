WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.496
There were some
other questions sort

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:06.500
of running along this
general idea of the fact

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.000
that the information
in DNA doesn't go,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
even though it encodes the
information for proteins

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.998
goes via this rRNA intermediate.

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:21.000
Someone asked what was the M.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.665
The M is for messenger.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.000
The idea being
that since the DNA,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.070
at least in eukaryotes
the DNA was in the nucleus

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.815
and proteins were made
out of the cytoplasm,

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:34.000
somehow that information had
to be carried from the nucleus

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where the DNA was
out to the cytoplasm.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.842
And that's where
the term messenger

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:41.284
was because the RNA was
seen as something that would

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:43.000
carry the information out.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.108
Now, a point here,
it's really critical

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:51.000
because we're going to continue
to talk about gene regulation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And that is when a cell is
making one of these mRNAs,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.663
it doesn't make one single
copy of all of the genes

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.816
that are in the
genome on one RNA.

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:06.936
Instead it does it either
one gene at a time,

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:09.120
which is the usual
case, or occasionally

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.178
as we see in the lac operon
a little tiny cluster of DNAs

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.000
that have related functions.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.375
And the beauty of
that is that it then

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:24.080
enables the cell to dial in
how much protein is being made,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.535
in part at least, by determining
how much RNA is being made.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:32.596
So you're going to make no RNA
and not make the protein at all

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:35.307
or make a little RNA and
get a little protein,

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:37.763
or if it's really
a thing you need

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:41.394
very large quantities of you can
really crank out a lot of RNA

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:43.000
and make a lot of protein.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.100
So the potential is
there for regulation.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.834
And in bacteria, as I said,
for almost all bacterial genes

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:50.000
it's pretty straightforward.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.394
You can look in the
DNA, and at least

00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.596
if you know where to start,
see the start of a protein,

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.400
you can just use that
table of the genetic code

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400
and read off the sequence.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.725
But eukaryotes in particular,
higher eukaryotes have this odd

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:09.536
business that what seemed odd
and surprising that when you

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:13.800
look at their genes, many
of them you cannot do that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.200
because it's as if there
are extra bits of DNA stuck

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.357
in the middle.

00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:22.213
And in some cases
you heard it could

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:27.688
be really huge amounts of DNA so
that there is this extra thing

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:30.000
where there's a pre mRNA.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.224
And this RNA splicing we
talked about has to take place

00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:35.922
to generate the mRNA.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:41.384
And once you have the mRNA then
the ribosome and the charge

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:44.456
tRNAs can be used to
make the proteins.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:49.000
And someone asked what
all that extra DNA is for.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.428
I mean we still don't
fully understand that.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:57.000
There are some
regulatory sequences

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and regulatory actors that are
buried in that non coding DNA.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.565
But another thing may
be that this is just

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:07.333
the way it's worked
in evolution.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:10.663
And as long as it works
there's no driving force

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:13.000
necessarily to get rid of it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If you look at
microorganisms, for example,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
yeast is a eukaryotic
that, like E. coli,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.541
has to replicate
pretty fast in order

00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.220
to compete with other
microorganisms for the food

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.000
and whatnot in its environment.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
And it has relatively little
of these extra intervening

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.496
sequences compared to
what we find in our DNA.

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:38.000
I gave you the
example of Factor 8.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.663
It didn't really particularly
matter what it was in the sense

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:45.456
that it was just an example
of something that has

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:47.454
a lot of intervening sequence.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:51.540
What it is, though,
it's one of a set

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.000
of proteins that are involved
in clotting of your blood.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.632
When you cut yourself,
we have this system

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:04.220
that prevents us from
bleeding to death,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.816
unless you have hemophilia or
something like that where's

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.000
there's a problem with
the clotting system,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.664
then a very complex
set of things happen.

00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:18.875
And Factor 8 is one of
the several proteins that

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.000
play critical roles in that.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.440
Somebody asked, I talked
about a few things

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.688
that were, this was
sort of the dogma.

00:04:29.688 --> 00:04:32.908
This was how information
was thought to go.

00:04:32.908 --> 00:04:35.632
And then how Dave
Baltimore found

00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:39.724
there was reverse transcriptase
that could take an RNA

00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:42.000
and make a DNA copy.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.178
And the question was
they didn't understand

00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:47.357
how the dogma could change.

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:50.213
I mean that's sort
of what I'm trying

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:52.832
to emphasize a
lot in this course

00:04:52.832 --> 00:04:56.576
is what I'm teaching you is
what human experimentation

00:04:56.576 --> 00:04:59.496
and thought has
brought up until spring

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:02.000
of 2005 of terms in biology.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.750
Some of the sort of
basic discoveries

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.332
were made in physics
so long ago that it's

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:09.000
very unlikely that you'll
come in and discover

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that the Newtonian mechanics
you learned as a freshman is not

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.998
operative anymore
when you're a senior,

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:18.776
but you can still have these
massive revolutions in biology

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.332
where just suddenly whole
things, like RNA splicing,

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:25.000
emerge from the woodwork
almost overnight.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.904
And that's, in fact,
what happened with that.

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:30.284
That's what happened with
reverse transcriptase.

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:33.140
So, in a sense,
it's almost a joke

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.565
that Crick called it dogma.

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:36.428
He didn't know
what he was doing.

00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:38.140
But it sort of took
that property on.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.128
And I'm trying to caution you
that even though some of you

00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:43.333
would like me to
stick to just facts

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.331
that we're continually
learning and there

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.000
are discoveries being
made even as we're

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
going on with this course.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.444
Now, I told you that there
were certain viruses, HIV

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:56.108
being the one I
really emphasized,

00:05:56.108 --> 00:05:58.000
that have this property.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Their genetic
material is not DNA.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.800
It's RNA.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.363
And the reverse transcriptase
makes a double strand copy

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:07.904
that it inserts into
the organism's DNA

00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:10.000
and becomes a permanent part.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.714
And I'm trying to
caution you that's why

00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:16.213
safe sex is such a big deal.

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:18.570
Because if you get
infected with HIV

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.135
you'll have it for
the rest of your life.

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:23.452
I mentioned there were
some cancer viruses,

00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:26.000
and someone said,
well, if you do

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.330
that how can you cure cancer?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.425
Well, in fact, we're
lucky in the sense

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:36.428
that we don't have to contend
at this point in a major way

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:40.307
with human cancer viruses, that
would be more of a problem,

00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:41.842
but your cats have to.

00:06:41.842 --> 00:06:44.888
You may have heard of the
feline leukemia virus.

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:48.454
This is a retrovirus
of this same class,

00:06:48.454 --> 00:06:53.000
and cats infected with it
have it in their saliva.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.998
And although it
can be transmitted

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.000
amongst pets in
the same household,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.978
the big problem is
usually cat fights.

00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:03.936
And then you get a scratch
and then it gets in.

00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:05.666
So if you have a
cat you probably

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.000
had to take it to the
vet and get vaccinated.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.456
And one of the reasons
is you're trying

00:07:11.456 --> 00:07:14.452
to get it vaccinated against
the feline leukemia virus.

00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:19.284
And it's just sort of
like that story I told you

00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:22.842
with the streptococcus, that
if your immune system has

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.307
seen the thing beforehand
then if you actually

00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:28.070
get an infection it has
a very quick response

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.178
and your cat doesn't get
infected by the virus.

00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:33.500
And therefore doesn't
become a candidate

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500
for getting leukemia
in later life.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.000
OK.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.458
So at least there's an effort
to try and response to at least

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:42.500
a few of the things.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.152
There were some very interesting
and thoughtful questions.

00:07:46.152 --> 00:07:50.921
So I want to now go back
to talk a little bit more

00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:53.684
about this issue of
regulation because that is one

00:07:53.684 --> 00:07:55.815
of the real secrets to life.

00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:58.000
And it's the
ability of organisms

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.995
to turn on and off
certain functions

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.333
and to have rheostats
where the can control

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:03.665
the levels of expression.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:07.000
But all of this has
to be in the DNA.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.664
And so before people
knew how this worked,

00:08:09.664 --> 00:08:11.000
it's a little mysterious.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And maybe one way you
might think about it, well,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.904
if I have a gene that
encodes something

00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:21.920
for lactose metabolism,
and I tell you there's

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.999
a sequence upstream of this and
somehow this gene is regulated

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:29.666
depending on whether I put
lactose in the medium or not,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:31.664
how is it going to work?

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:34.285
Does it have to fit
into little holes

00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:36.565
in between the letters
of the genetic code

00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:40.000
sort of the way Gamov
originally thought about it,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
or is there some
other mechanism?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.663
And what you'll see here is
one of the general strategies

00:08:46.663 --> 00:08:50.330
that evolution has chosen
is although there's

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.726
regulatory information
in the DNA,

00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:55.630
DNA isn't a particularly
good molecule for recognizing

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.000
things, but what it is good
at is encoding proteins.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.213
So the trick is to
have some proteins made

00:09:04.213 --> 00:09:07.500
whose role in life
are to be regulators.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.000
So that this is
what is underlying

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
this system that I started
to tell you about on Friday.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:30.496
So remember -- -- beta
galactosidase is the enzyme

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:34.800
that takes lactose which is
lactose beta 1,4 glucose.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.665
And somebody said it's
easy to get them mixed up.

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:44.600
I apologize, but
those are the names.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.800
And cleaves it,
just breaks the bond

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.800
to give galactose plus glucose.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.714
Both of those can be
metabolized by ordinary elements

00:09:57.714 --> 00:10:02.000
you'll find in most cells.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But taking lactose, which
you also know as milk sugar

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
because it's in milk,
needs this extra function.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.997
If you're lactose intolerant,
as a fraction of you

00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:17.500
will be because that's quite
common in the human population,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.565
then, although you had the
enzyme when you were baby,

00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:23.332
it's been shut off in
your body since then

00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:24.664
and it causes problems.

00:10:24.664 --> 00:10:27.815
Because if you eat lactose,
drink milk or something,

00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:30.571
the lactose goes right
through your stomach

00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:34.000
and ends up in your intestine.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And there are bacteria in there
that are able to break it open.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.641
And when they do that it leads
to gas and some other sort

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:45.856
of uncomfortablenesses
that are associated

00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:48.000
with lactose intolerance.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.541
So, as I'd said,
the major finding

00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.664
was that this enzyme beta
galactosidase or beta

00:10:53.664 --> 00:10:54.912
gal was regulated.

00:10:54.912 --> 00:10:57.000
That if you grow E.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.142
coli on glucose -- --
there was no beta gal.

00:11:07.142 --> 00:11:11.362
And if you grow them on
lactose as the carbon source

00:11:11.362 --> 00:11:15.000
then there were high
levels of beta gal.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And that then lead Jacques
Monod and Francois Jacob,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.996
the two French
scientists I mentioned,

00:11:23.996 --> 00:11:27.110
to begin studying this problem.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.000
And, like so many
things in biology,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.178
they were working
on a huge problem,

00:11:34.178 --> 00:11:36.000
how are genes regulated?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.072
But it wasn't so evident
at the beginning.

00:11:39.072 --> 00:11:43.000
What they were doing was
this very modest thing,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.771
why is beta galactosidase
there in one condition and not

00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:48.270
another?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.384
Just a little problem
in bacterial metabolism.

00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:54.072
And ultimately it
gave us the roots

00:11:54.072 --> 00:11:57.248
to the answer of how
genes are regulated.

00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:01.999
And I just have to leave out
all the beautify stuff that

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.664
led to what they found.

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:07.997
Let me just recapitulate what I
put on the board the other day.

00:12:07.997 --> 00:12:12.664
It turned out that the LacC
gene, this is the gene that

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:15.000
encodes beta
galactosidase, so that's

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the sequence, that has
the sequence of codons,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.280
that if you could
start at the beginning

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.912
and go along and just put all
the amino acids in you would

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.000
end up with beta galactosidase.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.580
That unit of
genetic information,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:41.538
which is called the lacC
gene, let's put it here.

00:12:41.538 --> 00:12:47.460
Then there were two
other genes just

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.748
downstream of this in the DNA.

00:12:52.748 --> 00:13:01.000
And this unit is made
as a single mRNA.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So this is a little bit
different than what I told you.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.815
It's not just one gene.

00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:09.800
It's actually two or three
because these bacteria

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.000
try to do everything very
efficiently because they're

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.888
growing quickly.

00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:18.600
This means it can turn on
three genes of related function

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.400
very efficiently.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.800
When you have several genes that
are expressed using one mRNA,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.000
as I said, the genes are said
to be organized in an operon.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.570
But the key point that
we talked about before is

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.816
you're going to have these
genes expressed everything

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:40.000
has to be written in the DNA.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.688
And it's not using
the genetic code.

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:46.110
It's using other words
that are written there.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:52.000
And you've seen this word
now in several lectures.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
That's a promoter.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And that means to
start transcription.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.565
And to stop the
mRNA there has to be

00:14:02.565 --> 00:14:04.000
something at the other end.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.330
And I'll show you the
sequence of at least one

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.666
of these promoters in a minute.

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:13.000
This means to stop
transcription,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.496
to stop making the RNA copy.

00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:18.000
If you didn't have
sequences like

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.377
that the cell wouldn't know
where should I begin the RNA

00:14:21.377 --> 00:14:23.500
and where does it end.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.000
And since there are
many, many genes,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
there have to be many
promoters and many terminators.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.840
And the other point
I tried to hammer

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.178
home the other day is although
the genetic code is universal,

00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:41.000
you can take that little
table and read the sequence

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
of human proteins or E.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.500
coli proteins, these
other languages

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.500
that are written using this four
letter nucleic acid alphabet

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.000
are not universal.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.330
So the sequences that E.
coli uses for a promoter,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.998
a start transcription are
very different than what

00:14:55.998 --> 00:14:59.110
our bodies use as a start
transcription thing.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.932
And when we get to the
recombinant DNA stuff

00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:06.262
that will be an issue.

00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:10.636
So this mRNA is then
used to make proteins.

00:15:10.636 --> 00:15:17.538
This would be beta galactosidase
or the lac Z gene product,

00:15:17.538 --> 00:15:22.380
and these other genes make,
so these are proteins.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.766
Here you see this flow of
information from the DNA

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:32.800
through the mRNA down to
being made into proteins.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.357
In the case of bacteria
there's no nucleus.

00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:40.927
Everything is in one big
pot so that mRNA doesn't

00:15:40.927 --> 00:15:43.920
have to go anywhere,
but it's all there

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.908
and it gets translated to
give copies of the protein.

00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:51.540
So, as I said,
somehow if the cell

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.086
is going to now regulate whether
these genes are expressed

00:15:56.086 --> 00:16:03.000
or not, depending on
whether lactose is present.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.926
And the way they do it
makes perfect sense.

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:06.921
Don't bother to make
the enzyme if there's

00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:09.070
no lactose in the
neighborhood, and only

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.532
make it if it's present.

00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:12.660
So how are they
going to do that?

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.088
Is the lactose going
to come along and stick

00:16:15.088 --> 00:16:17.000
into some little hole
here or something?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.995
That's not a general
strategy and it

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:22.600
wouldn't work if you look at
the structure of DNA anyway.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.998
It wouldn't have access
to the sequence of bases.

00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:35.165
So what was discovered was that
there was another gene very

00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:37.664
close called lacI.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:45.844
And the protein that it encodes
is called the lac repressor.

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:56.250
And since it's a gene it
has to have a promoter,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.000
a start transcription.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.918
But this one, be careful now,
don't get yourself mixed up,

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:09.800
this is for the lacI gene.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.544
This is a different promoter
over here for this thing.

00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:21.583
And then there is
also then a terminator

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.915
or a stop transcription.

00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:28.700
And, again, this is
for the lacI gene.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:35.000
So this gets made
into an mRNA as well.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.726
And this gets translated
into a protein

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:44.750
that's known as lac repressor.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:53.000
And what that lac repressor
has is the ability to bind

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to a particular sequence in
DNA that's located right here.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:16.998
This is a binding site right
here for lac repressor.

00:18:16.998 --> 00:18:23.000
So let me just try
to blow that up

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.326
just a little bit because
this could be a little bit

00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:31.000
confusing.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:50.815
So here's the promoter --
-- for this LacCYA operon.

00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:53.307
Here's the beginning
of the LacC gene.

00:18:53.307 --> 00:18:55.763
And so this is where
the RNA polymerase,

00:18:55.763 --> 00:18:59.456
the machine that's going to
make the RNA copy has to bind.

00:18:59.456 --> 00:19:01.000
And here's the binding site.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.400
-- for lac repressor
or the lacI protein.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.800
So how does this circuit work?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.140
And I sort of pose that as
an issue for those of you

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.000
who had followed it at
least to that point.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So let's consider
the two situations.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.998
If there's no
lactose present what

00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:37.110
we know from just scientists
knew from experimentation

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.440
was there was no
beta galactosidase

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.200
activity inside the cell.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.771
You could crack them open and
you wouldn't find this enzyme

00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:47.270
there.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.454
And when you added
lactose they knew,

00:19:50.454 --> 00:19:53.178
from that experiment
described on Friday,

00:19:53.178 --> 00:19:55.625
it was synthesized de novo.

00:19:55.625 --> 00:20:00.000
So if there's no
lactose present --

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And what happens is we have the
lacI gene, mRNA is being made,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.500
this lac repressor
is being made,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:21.000
here's the promoter for LacCYA,
and here's the sequence.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.331
And this repressor goes
up and binds to that.

00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:34.400
And by binding to this
particular sequence

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.000
what it does is it
covers up the promoter.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.632
It covers up the start
signal, the signal

00:20:41.632 --> 00:20:44.428
that says "start
transcription here".

00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:48.000
Are you guys with me?

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.815
It's a relatively
simple strategy.

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:52.768
It's just by lac repressor
having that ability

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:55.456
to bind to a particular
sequence it's

00:20:55.456 --> 00:20:58.666
able to prevent
the RNA polymerase

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:02.000
from seeing the promoter.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.270
And therefore it's
able to prevent

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.000
the RNA from being made.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So there's no mRNA.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.500
And if there's no mRNA
over here then there's

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.400
no beta galactosidase
being made.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.000
This is an exercise in futility.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.380
Why has the cell gone and
made this useless protein

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:32.375
that isn't doing anything
in terms of helping

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:35.000
it metabolize lactose?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.128
But now take a
look at the system

00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:40.332
compared to what I described
when we were first doing it.

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:43.416
If we had to do all
the regulation directly

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.328
with the DNA we
have this problem

00:21:46.328 --> 00:21:48.855
that lactose would
somehow have to be

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:51.705
able to see a sequence in
DNA and somehow determine

00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:52.357
what happened.

00:21:52.357 --> 00:21:55.213
But what this cell
has done now is

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:58.228
it's set this system
up so that the ability

00:21:58.228 --> 00:22:00.377
to make lactose or
not make lactose

00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:06.000
is conditional on this protein
called the lac repressor.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.086
If lac repressor is
bound, as it's shown here,

00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:12.816
it's basically covering
up the promoter,

00:22:12.816 --> 00:22:17.362
the cell cannot make RNA and
cannot make beta galactosidase.

00:22:17.362 --> 00:22:23.000
If it was absent, if we just
got rid of lac repressor

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
then the promoter
would be exposed

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.080
and the cell could make
beta galactosidase.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.875
And so it's now lac repressor
that has the conditionality.

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:37.000
It's, in essence, a sensor.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.328
It can at least be
considered a sensor

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:42.454
for whether lactose is present.

00:22:42.454 --> 00:22:47.000
And indeed that is the property
that lac repressor has.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.080
It's able to bind lactose.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:23:00.000
So if we think lactose
is present what happens?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I mean this lacI gene is
a pretty uninteresting,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.178
uninteresting from the
standpoint of regulation

00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:09.776
in the sense that it's
made all the time.

00:23:09.776 --> 00:23:13.842
The cell just continually cranks
out a bit of lac repressor.

00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:15.377
It doesn't need very much.

00:23:15.377 --> 00:23:18.565
It just needs to make enough
so that the one binding

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:21.332
site for lac repressor
has somebody bound to it.

00:23:21.332 --> 00:23:24.750
So it can get away
with pretty low levels.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:30.545
But over here then we
have this promoter,

00:23:30.545 --> 00:23:36.000
and we have the LacC
gene and so on here,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.664
and there is the binding
sequence right there.

00:23:40.664 --> 00:23:46.000
But this lac repressor has
the ability to bind lactose,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.500
which I'm going to draw
as a little triangle here,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:57.000
even though you know
it's a disaccharide.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
It has a different property.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
But the fundamental
characteristic

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
of the lac repressor
binding lactose

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.912
is it undergoes a
change in confirmation.

00:24:09.912 --> 00:24:14.000
So if it's got a binding
pocket, and lactose

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.768
fits into that
binding pocket, those

00:24:16.768 --> 00:24:20.224
alpha helices and beta
sheets and so on move

00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:21.768
around a little bit.

00:24:21.768 --> 00:24:24.456
And what happens
then is it perturbs

00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:27.816
the part of the protein
that would normally

00:24:27.816 --> 00:24:31.000
be able to recognize
this DNA sequence.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:44.200
And this cannot -- -- bind
to the DNA sequence up here.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.180
And I'll tell you the special
name for that binding site.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:55.544
It's just one of these terms
that you'll see in biology.

00:24:55.544 --> 00:25:00.000
Everything has to
be given a name.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.250
It's called an operator,
for historical reasons.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.000
But, in any case,
the lac repressor,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.461
once it's hanging
onto a lactose it's

00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:14.766
unable to bind this sequence.

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:19.635
That means that the start site
for transcription is made.

00:25:19.635 --> 00:25:25.000
And so you get the
mRNA made and then

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
you get beta
galactosidase present.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.267
A little bit complicated,
but sort of underlying it

00:25:33.267 --> 00:25:35.710
is this idea that
now the cell is

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.000
using a protein rather
than DNA to tell

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.816
whether lactose is present.

00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:44.200
And hopefully you can see
this is really general now

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.000
because you can design
a regulatory protein.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.856
And basically it's got
to have two things.

00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:54.220
It's got to have a part
that talks to the DNA

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.832
and recognizes some
sequence, and it's

00:25:56.832 --> 00:26:01.000
got to have another part
that senses whatever it is.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.500
Histidine, temperature,
you name it.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.920
But once you understand
that design principle then

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.428
you can begin to see how
it is that the cell is

00:26:11.428 --> 00:26:15.416
able to turn genes on and off
just by encoding information

00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:16.664
in the DNA.

00:26:16.664 --> 00:26:20.416
And, as I say, one
of the big tricks

00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:25.000
there is to let the protein
do the sensing for you.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.680
Now, I just want to give you a
little bit of a blowup of what

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.800
this things looks like.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.800
Because sort of all
I've done is kind of

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.200
put it here as a sequence.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200
I've called it a promoter.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.885
What a promoter
then is, again it

00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:50.000
means the start
for transcription,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
the process of making RNA.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.360
And I've tried to stress
that these promoters are not

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.000
universal.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So when I tell you this for E.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.400
coli, this is what a promoter
for E. coli looks like,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.664
but it doesn't look at all
like a promoter in our bodies.

00:27:17.664 --> 00:27:20.000
And so it's basically
a word that's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.996
written using this
nucleic acid alphabet.

00:27:23.996 --> 00:27:27.998
And it looks
something like this.

00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:35.000
There's TTGACA and then there
are about 17 base pairs that

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
can be just about anything.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.400
And then there's TATAAT.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.428
And then there's
another little bit here

00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:46.996
that's about ten
base pairs long.

00:27:46.996 --> 00:27:52.725
And then this is the start
of the mRNA which is usually

00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:58.400
given the convention of being
called the plus one position.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.875
So you'll notice this word
I've called it, written,

00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:09.304
that says start transcription
has even got two parts to it.

00:28:09.304 --> 00:28:13.152
And this is usually referred
to the minus ten region

00:28:13.152 --> 00:28:17.000
of the promoter, and this
is the minus 35 region

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
because that's the distance
from the start of transcription.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.120
It maybe seem sort of
weird to you to see

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.875
what I'm telling you
is sort of word written

00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:32.000
in the nucleic acid language.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
It's got some bits in the
middle that don't matter.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.377
But remember the DNA is a
helix and things going around

00:28:38.377 --> 00:28:39.000
like this.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.500
So if you were just
to take a DNA helix

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.776
and then lay something
down on one side of it,

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:48.535
it would contact it here, it
wouldn't contact it there,

00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:52.665
and then when it came back up
again it would contact it here.

00:28:52.665 --> 00:28:56.330
And so as these things hang
on along the sides of DNA

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.726
it's not at all uncommon to
find this sort of broken where

00:28:59.726 --> 00:29:01.904
you can have something
that matters,

00:29:01.904 --> 00:29:04.998
something that doesn't
matter and something

00:29:04.998 --> 00:29:07.000
that matters again.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.994
The RNA polymerase in
E. coli, it's a machine.

00:29:12.994 --> 00:29:19.500
It's got four proteins
that are the core.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.818
That's the part that
actually synthesizes

00:29:24.818 --> 00:29:34.776
the RNA plus one protein, which
is known as the sigma subunit.

00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:43.100
And it has the special job
of recognizing the promoter.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.000
And so when we
start asking where

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.104
does this regulatory sequence
that the lac repressor

00:29:55.104 --> 00:29:59.330
binds it in all of this.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:18.416
It turns out that the sequence
for binding lac repressor -- --

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.912
overlaps with this
minus ten region.

00:30:20.912 --> 00:30:24.248
So when the lac
repressor is sitting down

00:30:24.248 --> 00:30:27.160
it's covering up a
very important part

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.000
of transcription.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.332
You guys with me?

00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:30.915
OK.

00:30:30.915 --> 00:30:36.285
So this is an interesting
kind of regulation.

00:30:36.285 --> 00:30:53.000
It's given the general term
-- -- negative regulation.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.331
And the reason that
term is applied,

00:30:55.331 --> 00:31:11.500
it means that the
regulatory protein -- --

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:19.000
interferes with transcription.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.072
And let's take a
brief foray into we're

00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:28.332
going to talk about genetics
as our next subject.

00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:41.284
And I think maybe we can
let you sort of already

00:31:41.284 --> 00:31:57.000
get a sense of how some
of this was figured out.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:09.304
So there's a substance
called X gal, which

00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:21.724
is a galactose with some
chemical entity hanging off

00:32:21.724 --> 00:32:24.086
that's colorless.

00:32:24.086 --> 00:32:30.285
But yet it's a
substrate textbook.

00:32:30.285 --> 00:32:31.544
And so if we grow E.

00:32:31.544 --> 00:32:33.377
coli on plates that
have glucose plus X gal,

00:32:33.377 --> 00:32:35.627
the colonies would be we
learn all this kind of thing.

00:32:35.627 --> 00:32:37.250
It just doesn't
come out of a whose

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.000
bond can be cleaved
by beta galactosidase.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.918
experimentally I'm
not doing too good

00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:41.142
a job of conveying
to you how colorless.

00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:42.683
And if we were to
grow them on plates

00:32:42.683 --> 00:32:45.499
that had lactose plus but
I think if you don't have

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:47.184
some sense of how this is done

00:32:47.184 --> 00:32:48.600
Someone said they
thought this was

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.610
too much lab stuff, X gal
then all of the colonies

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.235
would be colored
because they're making

00:32:52.235 --> 00:32:55.768
And this is a very useful thing
for bacterial geneticists.

00:32:55.768 --> 00:32:57.684
And it gives galactose
plus the free X entity.

00:32:57.684 --> 00:32:59.600
And this is colored.
beta galactosidase.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:07.090
And part of the way that
this stuff that I've

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:12.545
been telling you was figured
out was by bacterial geneticists

00:33:12.545 --> 00:33:14.180
looking for something.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.000
What they looked
for was back here

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.270
on this plate that had Xgal.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.750
Almost all the colonies
were colorless.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:31.090
These were colored because they
could make beta galactosidase.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:39.330
So if I gave you some plates
of this, you looked in the lab

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:46.181
and then you found a colored
colony, it's a mutant.

00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:52.000
I'll define these terms
for you very shortly.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.150
But it's got an alteration
in the DNA that affects

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:08.356
the regulation -- -- of beta
gal or the product of the lacC

00:34:08.356 --> 00:34:08.856
gene.

00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:14.000
And on the basis of what I've
told you about this model,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.800
can you guys come up with two
types of things, two places

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.900
or kinds of mutations that
could break this system that

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:31.662
would lead to beta galactosidase
being on even though there's

00:34:31.662 --> 00:34:35.250
no lactose in the medium?

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:39.000
Anybody see one of them?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.844
Why is it off?

00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:42.688
Because of lac repressor?

00:34:42.688 --> 00:34:47.000
In a wild type strain
it's because lac repressor

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.500
is bound to that
sequence and it's

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.200
shutting off transcription.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:35:03.500
So we had a variant that
could now transcribe.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:10.000
Yeah.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.304
OK, so that's a good idea.

00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:16.500
So if we could somehow mutate
that little binding sequence

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.555
in a way that didn't screw
up everything else then,

00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:26.000
even though there was
lac repressor being made,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
if it couldn't bind here because
the sequence had been changed

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.125
then you'd get it made.

00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:37.000
That's exactly right.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.580
That's one of them.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.080
Yeah.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.000
OK, it was a
problem making lacI.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.248
What would happen?

00:35:43.248 --> 00:35:47.800
Well, if we couldn't make this
and it couldn't bind there

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.000
we'd be on.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
And that's the other class.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.328
Can you think of
a kind of mutation

00:35:54.328 --> 00:35:56.908
that we learned
about, think back

00:35:56.908 --> 00:36:00.086
to the genetic code,
that would prevent

00:36:00.086 --> 00:36:10.000
lac repressor from being made?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.149
I'm trying to give you a clue.

00:36:12.149 --> 00:36:15.142
There were 61 codons
encoded for amino acids.

00:36:15.142 --> 00:36:15.713
Yeah.

00:36:15.713 --> 00:36:18.000
Oh, that would work.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.178
Yup, if we messed
up the promoter.

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.000
That's a sophisticated answer.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.330
Yeah, if we messed up the
promoter for making lacI

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.800
that would certainly give that.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.500
Can you think of
another type of thing

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:38.000
that would affect the lacI
gene, would prevent lacI

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.333
from being made?

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:45.666
Somebody?

00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:48.773
Yeah.

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:49.272
OK.

00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:52.000
If the sequence was wrong
so that they could bind,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.228
that would be good.

00:36:53.228 --> 00:36:56.000
The one I'm trying
to tease out of you,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.526
but I won't take longer now,
is remember those three stop

00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:01.150
codons that didn't
encode for anything?

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.332
There should be one of those
at the end of the protein.

00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:07.307
But if you changed
one of the amino acid

00:37:07.307 --> 00:37:09.763
codons into a stop
codon that would also

00:37:09.763 --> 00:37:11.333
prevent you from making it.

00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:15.000
So there are at least a
couple of kinds of mutations.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.712
And what I've sort
of done here is

00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:19.452
I've skipped all the evidence
and given you the model.

00:37:19.452 --> 00:37:23.815
And I cannot give you all the
evidence that lead to this,

00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:26.400
which is a pretty well
established model.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.000
I don't think this is
going to change likely.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.331
We've been studying
it for so long.

00:37:32.331 --> 00:37:36.816
But this is the kind of
evidence on which it was based.

00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:40.908
In was by people finding
things and figuring out

00:37:40.908 --> 00:37:46.090
that parts of the machinery
were broken and then working on.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.360
So there's another
kind of regulation

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.454
known as positive regulation.

00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:55.540
And for a long time people
though maybe everything

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.250
was negative regulation.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:03.220
But it turns out positive
regulation is far more common.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.625
In this case, the
regulatory protein

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:09.125
instead of inhibiting
transcription

00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:12.000
assists with the transcription.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.362
And it turned out,
after people had

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:19.632
been studying the
beta galactosidase

00:38:19.632 --> 00:38:26.000
system for a number of years,
that it had a positive control

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.328
system superimposed or together
with the negative regulatory

00:38:31.328 --> 00:38:32.000
system.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.328
The same thing engineers
do all the time,

00:38:35.328 --> 00:38:39.856
pile up regulatory
circuits and get all kinds

00:38:39.856 --> 00:38:42.000
of additional conditionalities.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.664
And the thing I've
told you saw far

00:38:44.664 --> 00:38:48.333
was we asked whether
beta gal is present.

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:57.331
And the carbon source
-- -- is glucose.

00:38:57.331 --> 00:39:02.000
This is low or not there.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
If it's lactose it's high, but
if cells were grown on both,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
glucose plus lactose, then beta
galactosidase is low again.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And this makes some
physiological sense because E.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
coli likes to use galactose.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
It's its favorite food source.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.224
And so if it's got its favorite
food source around then

00:39:28.224 --> 00:39:31.140
it doesn't want to
make proteins that

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.875
are used to eat all its sort
of less favorite food source.

00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:40.307
So there's a nice
conditionality here.

00:39:40.307 --> 00:39:42.456
In order for it,
the circuitry is

00:39:42.456 --> 00:39:46.800
set up so that it only makes the
enzyme for metabolizing lactose

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.724
when the cell realizes its
favorite food source isn't

00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:54.000
there and then it
senses there's lactose.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.856
So only under those conditions
does it make the enzymes

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:02.000
for making lactose.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.800
And, again, the way
this circuitry works,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.665
this positive regulation
needs two things.

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:11.000
Once again, it needs a protein.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.912
This one has given the name CRP.

00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:17.071
And, again, it's something
that's able to bind

00:40:17.071 --> 00:40:18.856
to a sequence in DNA.

00:40:18.856 --> 00:40:21.666
And then it's also
got a conditionality.

00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:25.416
It's able to recognize
something else.

00:40:25.416 --> 00:40:29.576
And what this one recognizes
is this small molecule that's

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:35.142
known on cyclic
A&P. It's just the

00:40:35.142 --> 00:40:39.428
familiar [ribomonophosphate?
that you've seen

00:40:39.428 --> 00:40:46.000
before but it's looped around
and formed an ester bond here.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.998
And that's why it's
called cyclic A&P.

00:40:49.998 --> 00:40:54.000
But the important
thing about this

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
is that the levels of cyclic
A&P are dependant on glucose.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.557
So if you have high glucose
you have low cyclic A&P

00:41:08.557 --> 00:41:17.076
and if you have low glucose
you have high cyclic A&P.

00:41:17.076 --> 00:41:23.857
And here again is
what's going to happen.

00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:29.856
So this is the
promoter for LacCYA

00:41:29.856 --> 00:41:36.570
and here's the start
of the lacZ gene.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:46.000
And I told you this is where
the operator would be finding.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:59.250
This CRP protein is
able to bind to -- --

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:12.000
a site that's even a little bit
farther upstream of the LacC

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
gene than is the promoter.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:26.250
And the idea of this is that
if this CRP [lacs?] -- --

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:36.228
just by itself, it
doesn't bind to the DNA.

00:42:36.228 --> 00:42:40.571
But it has a little
binding pocket that

00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:47.423
senses the levels of cyclic
A&P. So if the cell is starving

00:42:47.423 --> 00:42:51.766
for glucose, there are
high levels of A&P,

00:42:51.766 --> 00:43:00.328
then the CRP bound to cyclic
A&P, this is capable of binding

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:03.000
to this sequence.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000
So that sounds weird,
but what we've, again,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:19.704
got now is we've got a protein
whose binding to DNA is

00:43:19.704 --> 00:43:24.272
conditional to something
inside the cell.

00:43:24.272 --> 00:43:30.692
And rather than getting
in the way, what

00:43:30.692 --> 00:43:36.228
this does, if you
have a situation where

00:43:36.228 --> 00:43:42.750
you have CRP with
cyclic A&P bond to it

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:51.750
and it's next door to this
promoter, what it's able to do

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:57.000
is help RNA polymerase
recognize the promoter.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.090
So this helps RNA polymerase.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:07.428
Whereas, when we were talking
about the lac repressor what

00:44:07.428 --> 00:44:10.284
it was doing, if you
recall, was getting

00:44:10.284 --> 00:44:13.000
in the way of RNA polymerase.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And this actually has a
relatively simple sort

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.500
of molecular explanation
for what's going on.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:37.178
The RNA polymerase -- The best
sequence for the minus ten

00:44:37.178 --> 00:44:42.688
region of the promoter, that
I showed you over on the other

00:44:42.688 --> 00:44:46.428
board, is something with
the sequence TATAAT.

00:44:46.428 --> 00:44:50.461
So the RNA polymerase
machinery, it

00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:53.227
can recognize more
than one sequence,

00:44:53.227 --> 00:44:58.499
but if it sees a promoter that
has a minus ten region that

00:44:58.499 --> 00:45:01.461
is TATAAT, it really
binds well and that

00:45:01.461 --> 00:45:07.000
would be a very strong promoter
and you get lots of mRNA.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.816
Now, the LacC promoter
actually has two nucleotides

00:45:12.816 --> 00:45:15.000
that are different.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:26.000
It's TATGTT.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:38.000
So this is a very weak
promoter without help.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So in this lac system, if
we got rid of lac repressor

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
entirely so that the promoter
was just exposed all the time,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.808
as I showed you up
here, I've left out

00:45:50.808 --> 00:45:57.285
a detail in this first part
in that this promoter is not

00:45:57.285 --> 00:45:59.000
very strong.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.394
And we'd only get
a little bit of RNA

00:46:01.394 --> 00:46:03.000
and a little bit of protein.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And so what the cell does is if
it knows there is no galactose,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.840
knows there's no glucose around
and cyclic A&P levels are

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.664
high then it uses the
binding of the CRP to here

00:46:15.664 --> 00:46:18.416
to assist the RNA
polymerase and get on.

00:46:18.416 --> 00:46:21.328
I understand this is
a bit complicated.

00:46:21.328 --> 00:46:23.624
Some of you probably have it.

00:46:23.624 --> 00:46:26.120
Some of you will
be lost and you'll

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.710
have to sit and look at your
textbook for a little while.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:33.200
But it comes down to a couple
of really simple principles.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.999
One is to detect what's
going on the cell makes

00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:39.663
a regulatory protein, the
regulatory protein binds DNA

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.452
and it also senses something.

00:46:41.452 --> 00:46:44.363
And these things can
work in two ways.

00:46:44.363 --> 00:46:48.000
They can either bind
DNA and get in the way,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.995
they can be a negative
regulatory element,

00:46:49.995 --> 00:46:52.726
or they can bind
to DNA and they can

00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:56.000
help something happen and be
a positive regulatory element.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
All the rest are just
the details of lac.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.763
And we could spend the
entire course or regulation

00:47:02.763 --> 00:47:05.071
and barely scratch
the surface, but it's

00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:08.284
one of the huge secrets
of life that cells

00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:11.178
are able to individually
turn on different genes

00:47:11.178 --> 00:47:13.454
in different ways
at different times,

00:47:13.454 --> 00:47:17.540
have rheostats for levels,
coordinate great sets of genes

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.000
in response to various stimuli.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.500
OK?

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.650
See you on Wednesday.

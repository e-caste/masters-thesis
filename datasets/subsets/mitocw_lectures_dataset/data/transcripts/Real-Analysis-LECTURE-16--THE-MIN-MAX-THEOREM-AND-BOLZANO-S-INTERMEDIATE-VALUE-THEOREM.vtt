00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK, so let's
continue with our discussion

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.020 align:middle line:84%
about continuous
functions, no pun intended.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.715 align:middle line:84%
First, let me
recall a few facts.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is not a definition.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But this was a theorem
we proved last time.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I won't recall the
definition of continuity.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But we proved this theorem
characterizing continuity.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we have a subset
of R, an element in S,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and a function f going from S
to R, then f is continuous at C

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.702 align:middle line:84%
if and only if for
every sequence x sub n,

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
we have elements of S such
that xn converges to C.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We have limit as
n goes to infinity

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
if x sub n equals
f of C. So this was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
a theorem we proved last time.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And let me recall an older
theorem, which I said

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
was very powerful, but
never really gave you

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
any powerful
application, which we'll

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
start giving some
powerful applications now.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
which states that every bounded
sequence of real numbers

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:90%
has a convergent sub-sequence.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use
these two theorems today

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and in the next lecture to
prove that a continuous function

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
on a closed and bounded
interval is very well-behaved.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to show,
let's call it the theme,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is that so if f from a
closed and bounded interval

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is continuous, meaning it's
continuous at every point,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:90%
then it is well-behaved.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.525 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the first
thing that we're going to prove,

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
this will be a combination
of two theorems,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is that the image of a
closed and bounded interval

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
by a continuous function is
another closed and bounded

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:90%
interval.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And E could equal D. So this
could just be a single point.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, if f is
a constant function,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:84%
then the image would
just be a single point.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is a theme of this
lecture and the next lecture.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
And so, let's start.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we're going
to prove two theorems.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
min-max theorem,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and the other is called
Bolzano's intermediate value

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The min-max theorem will tell
you that f of an interval

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.905 align:middle line:84%
is always contained in
an interval of this type.

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the intermediate
value theorem

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
will tell you everything in
between two certain bounds

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%
is attained by f.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's start off with showing
that f of a closed and bounded

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.052 align:middle line:90%
interval is a bounded set.

00:04:59.052 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
recall what it means

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:90%
for a function to be bounded.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We say that a function from
a subset S to R is bounded.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So here, S is a subset of R--

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
is bounded if there exists
a non-negative B such

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that for all x and S, f of x
is bigger than or equal to B.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I take
f of x to be 3x plus 1.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And here, S is closed and
bounded interval 0, 1,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.245 align:middle line:90%
then f is bounded.

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So pictorially,
what does this mean?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, f of x equals 3x plus 1.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:90%
So at 1, it's going to be 4.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And pictorially, a
function is bounded

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
if the graph is always bounded
between two real numbers.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And for us, for f of x, it's
always bounded between 0 and 4

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in terms of this absolute value.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:90%
So f of x equals 3x plus 1.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or
equal to by the triangle

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
inequality 3 times the
absolute value of x plus 1.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:90%
X is between 0 and 1.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolute
value is bounded by 1.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.845 align:middle line:90%
So this function is bounded.

00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, how about a function
which is not bounded?

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Remember, whenever
we see a definition,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
we should try to negate it
to understand it better.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So f is unbounded if for all
B bigger than or equal to 0,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
there exists some bad x such
that f of x in absolute value

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to B.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So if a bounded
function is supposed

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to have a graph bounded
between two real numbers,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
an unbounded one is one in
which at least part of the graph

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is going off to plus
infinity or minus infinity.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So most basic example
we could think of

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is, let's say if we wanted
to go from 0, 1 to R. Again,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
we could take f of x to be
well, 0 at x equals 0, 1 over x

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:90%
if x is not equal to 0.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So this function
looks like 1, 1,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and goes up to infinity as
you approach x equals 0.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:90%
So why is this unbounded?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
We have to verify the
negation of the definition.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:90%
So claim f is unbounded.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Let B be bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
We now have to find an x
in 0, 1, so that 1 over x--

00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or so that f of x is bigger
than B. And this is pretty easy.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So let x be in R such that
1 over x is bigger than B.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So if B is equal to 0, we
take x to be anything in 0, 1.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
That's fair enough-- i.e.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
x [? less than ?] 1
over B. So if we like,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
we could make this explicit.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just keep it here.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, now if we take x
here and look at the graph,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be bigger
than B. And that's it.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So several of these proofs will
have the same flavor of what

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:90%
we're going to try and prove.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And this one is a nice one to
start off with, and necessary.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So my first theorem
that I want to prove

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
about continuous functions
on a bounded interval--

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
closed and bounded interval--
is that they're bounded.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a function from
a, b to R is continuous,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's continuous
at every point in a, b,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.945 align:middle line:90%
then f is bounded.

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So the proof of this theorem,
and several of these theorems,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
will be by contradiction.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we're on the
closed and bounded interval

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:84%
or that we're in
this setting is what

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
allows us to use
Bolzano-Weierstrass,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
this powerful tool.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- so assume
and, so like I said,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:24.245 align:middle line:84%
this proof is by contradiction,
that the conclusion is false.

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Which the precise
meaning is right here.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
For all b, there exists
an x and S such that that.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So for every b, I
can find an x and S

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
so that the absolute
value of f of x

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to b.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So I could take b to
be N, for example,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.045 align:middle line:90%
where N as a natural number.

00:12:57.045 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Then for all N,
a natural number,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
so I'm taking b to be N, there
exists x sub n in a, b, such

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that f of x sub n
in absolute value

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to n.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.948 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So now I have this
sequence, which

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.815 align:middle line:84%
is bounded because it's in this
closed and bounded interval.

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Then xn is bounded, because
it's in this closed and bounded

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:90%
interval a, b.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:54.908 align:middle line:84%
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass,
there exists a subsequence

00:13:54.908 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
x in sub k, of the sequence
x sub n and x in R, such

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that limit as k goes to infinity
of x of n sub k equals x.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I claim that this x is
actually in the interval a, b.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Since x of n sub
k is a subsequence

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n, which are
in a sub b, or a comma

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
b, so I have for all k x sub
n sub k is between a and b.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
This implies by what we
know about limits that

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:90%
limits respect inequalities.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, a is less
than or equal to limit

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
as k goes to infinity of x sub
n sub k, which is less than

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:90%
or equal to b.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is x.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:90%
So i.e.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
x is between a and b.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.682 align:middle line:84%
Another way, instead of
going through this is,

00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe we did
in the assignment,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that an interval of
this form is closed.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And you proved that
for a closed set--

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
so when I say an interval
of this form is closed,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's a closed set.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And you proved on the
assignment that for a closed

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.495 align:middle line:84%
set, if I have a
convergent sequence,

00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
then the limit of that sequence
has to belong to the set.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is really a
consequence of the fact

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that this interval
is a closed set.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So I have this
subsequence x sub n sub k.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It's converging to
x, which is in a, b.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And I know the function.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I haven't used
anything about f yet.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming
it's continuous.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at f of x.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:44.737 align:middle line:84%
Since f is continuous,
and the x sub n sub

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
k is converged to x as k goes to
infinity, I know by the theorem

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
up top over there, that f
of x equals the limit of f

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of x sub n sub k.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
absolute value of x

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the limit
as k goes to infinity

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.035 align:middle line:90%
of the absolute values.

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But now, f of x sub n is always
bigger than or equal to n.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
That's how the x
of n's were chosen.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
We assume that f is
unbounded, and therefore,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
all of these x sub n's in a, b
were chosen so that f of x sub

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%
n is bigger than or equal to n.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is bigger
than or equal to--

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so each of these is bigger
than or equal to n sub k.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:02.082 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.665 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, how to
write this without--

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.067 align:middle line:90%
So we'll write it this way.

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to write
the limit of something

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.358 align:middle line:84%
equals infinity,
because we haven't

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
said what it means for the limit
of something to equal infinity.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So then, the limit
as k goes to infinity

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of f of x sub n sub k
exists, which implies

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:90%
that the sequence is bounded.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.355 align:middle line:84%
A convergent sequence
is always bounded.

00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And since n sub k is always less
than or equal to f of x sub k,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is a bounded
sequence, this

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
tells me that the sequence
n sub k is bounded.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%
But this is impossible.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, to form a
subsequence, the n sub k's

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
are increasing integers,
which is a contradiction.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is always because n sub
1, is always less than n sub 2,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
is less than n 3, and so on.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So these are always getting
bigger without bound.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have
our contradiction.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, here's the
structure of the proof.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to assume
some property of f.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So we assume not.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
We get this kind of bad sequence
of numbers in this interval.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And using Bolzano-Weierstrass,
we get to pass to some limit x.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the continuity of f at x
essentially breaks the badness

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:90%
of this sequence x sub n.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see another
argument where

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of the same flavor.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:14.316 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So we'll soon
state that f always

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
achieves a maximum
value and minimum value.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So let me first on the closed
and bounded intervals-- so

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
let me precisely define
what these absolute mins

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
and absolute maxes are.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So let f be a function
from S to R. S

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:90%
is a non-empty subset of R.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We say, f achieves
an absolute max.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.046 align:middle line:90%
Let me write it this way--

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
an absolute min at
c in S if f of c

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:84%
sits below f of x for all x in
S. If for all x in S, f of c

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to f of x.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:90%
So this is an absolute min.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
f achieves absolute max
at d and S if f of d

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:90%
sits above everything.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Every x you stick into
f, if for all x in S,

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.592 align:middle line:84%
f of x is less than
or equal to f of d.

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
So for example.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.095 align:middle line:84%
So what's the picture
that goes with this?

00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:16.217 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.217 --> 00:22:18.425 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine we're on a
closed and bounded interval.

00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Then d-- so f achieves
absolute max at d.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The graph of f sits
below the value f of d.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And sits above the value f of c.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, absolute max
and mins at points

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
are so that the
function is always

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
sitting above f
evaluated at that point.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.002 align:middle line:90%
Just a quick Warning.

00:23:15.002 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, we're looking at--

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
all right, so this
is not to scale.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But let's say our
function looks like this.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is one,
two, three halves.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Then, this function does
not have an absolute max,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
does not achieve
an absolute max,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.795 align:middle line:84%
or achieve an absolute
min on the set 1, 2.

00:23:53.795 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
What you would like to say is
that f achieves an absolute min

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:90%
at 1.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But the graph does not sit
above f evaluated at 1.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Just like over
here, the graph of f

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
does not sit below
f evaluated at 2.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So absolute f achieves an
absolute min at a point

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
if the whole graph sits above
f evaluated at that point,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily some number,
it sits below the whole graph.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what boundedness means.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.376 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to clarify that
distinction between the graph

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
of a function being bounded
below by a number and f

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
achieving a min at
a certain point.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
graph of this function

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:90%
is bounded below by 1.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But f does not achieve an
absolute min at c equals 1.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So our next theorem
is the min-max theorem

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
for continuous functions,
which is the following.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Let f be a function from a,
b to R. If f is continuous,

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's continuous
at every point in a,b,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:84%
then f achieves absolute min
and absolute max on a, b.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So another way of stating
this, so let's just

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:19.215 align:middle line:84%
make this a remark, it says that
they there exists c, d, and a,

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:84%
b, such that f of a, b is
contained in f of c, f of d.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do the proof
of an absolute max.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And the proof of the absolute
min, I'll leave to you.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple change
in the argument that's

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
not too difficult.
And again, we're

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
going to use this powerful
tool, Bolzano-Weierstrass,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to go from an
arbitrary sequence in a, b,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:90%
to a convergent subsequence.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:26.388 align:middle line:90%
So this equals f from a to b--

00:27:26.388 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
let me write it this way.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
If this function is continuous,
then by what we've proven--

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:90%
where?

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
This implies f is bounded.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Then the set E given
by the range of f,

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
so f of x, where x is in a,
b, this set is bounded above.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
If the absolute value
of f of x is always

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal
to some b, then

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:84%
f of x is always bounded
above by b for all x and a, b.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
So this set is bounded above.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, let L be the
supremum of E, which

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
exists, because the real
numbers have the least upper

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we have a non-empty
subset which is bounded above,

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:90%
we can always find a supremum.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, since L is a supremum of
this set, we did this, I think,

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:90%
in an assignment.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I definitely
did an assignment.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists a
sequence of elements

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:08.640 align:middle line:84%
of this set E converging
to L. And to express

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that, that means there exists
some sequence of elements.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So there exists a
sequence of the form

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
f of x sub n such that
limit as n goes to infinity

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:90%
of f of x sub n equals L.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we would like to
show that L is equal to f

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.845 align:middle line:90%
of d for some number d.

00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And how we're going to do
that is, well, this is--

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the x sub n's are just
some sequence in a, b.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can pass to a subsequence,
which converges to some number,

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:90%
call it d.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to show
that f of d equals L.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we use continuity.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, that's
the whole proof.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Which we saw a
little bit over here.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:90%
We passed a subsequence.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to say that
the limit of this subsequence

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.015 align:middle line:84%
has the same property as
the original sequence.

00:30:11.015 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass, there
exists a subsequence x sub n

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:90%
sub k.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is a subsequence
of the sequence x sub n.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And as before, the
same argument and limit

00:30:46.110 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
d, but as before, d
will be in the set a, b,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
such that limit as k goes
to infinity of x of n sub k

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.118 align:middle line:90%
equals d.

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So we use
Bolzano-Weierstrass to pass

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to a subsequence
of the x sub n's,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and a convergent subsequence.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so, all of these x sub
n sub k's are between a and b.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So their limit d will
be between a and b.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But now, since f
is continuous at d,

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:84%
it's continuous at
every point in a, b.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's certainly continuous
at d-- f of d, this

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the limit
as k goes to infinity

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of f of x of n sub
k, since the x of n

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:90%
sub k's are converging to d.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, f of x
sub n sub k, this

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is also a subsequence of
the sequence f of x sub n.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And f of x sub n is a
convergent sequence.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So any subsequence has to
converge to the same thing.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Since f of x sub n converges
to L, and f of n sub k,

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
k is a subsequence
of f of x sub n.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And remember, what was L?

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:56.960 align:middle line:84%
L was the sup of V. And
therefore, for all x in a,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
b, f of x is less than or
equal to f of d, which means f

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:90%
achieves an absolute max at d.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.545 align:middle line:90%
And the absolute min is similar.

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:22.608 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.608 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'll leave it to you.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So just rerunning
through the proof.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:84%
We did use the fact that a
continuous function is bounded.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And we extracted the sup, if
you like, of the range of f.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, which is by this
exercise we did in one

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:84%
of the assignments, means
that this supremum is equal

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to the limit of f of x sub n's.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:84%
We would like to show L is
equal to f of d for some d.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
So we passed a subsequence
of the x sub n's.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
That does converge to
something in the interval a, b.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And we can show using
the continuity of f.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And how this original sequence
was chosen, that f at that

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
point is actually equal to
the supremum of that set.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, f achieves
an absolute max at that set.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
As beginning
students of math, one

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
of the things we
should be curious about

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:84%
is what hypotheses are
needed and what are not

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:90%
in the statements of theorems.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:90%
So our main hypothesis--

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
so we had two hypotheses
really in the theorem,

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that f is going from this closed
and bounded interval to R,

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and that f is continuous.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if we drop
one of those hypotheses?

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Is the conclusion still true,
that f achieves an absolute max

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and absolute min?

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So this example that
I drew right here

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
shows that we need to have the
function be continuous in order

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:84%
for it to achieve
an absolute max

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and absolute min on the
closed and bounded interval.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But it also needs to be on a
closed and bounded interval.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have some
continuous function from S

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
to R. Can we drop
the assumption that S

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is equal to this closed
and bounded interval?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Meaning could it be,
say, an open interval?

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.195 align:middle line:90%
Does the same conclusion hold?

00:36:12.195 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.025 align:middle line:84%
let's say f is from
an open interval.

00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, no.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Simple example is, if I take
the function f of x equals,

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
for example, 1 over x,
minus 1 over 1 minus x.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And on the open
interval 0, 1, so what

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:90%
does this guy look like?

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Here's 0.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Let me draw a dotted line there.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Here's 1.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the graph shoots
up to positive infinity

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.145 align:middle line:84%
as you approach 0 and
as you approach 1.

00:37:20.145 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So where does it equal 0?

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I guess there's 1/2.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So this function
does not achieve

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.320 align:middle line:90%
a absolute min or absolute max.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But it is continuous
on this interval.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But because the interval
is not closed and bounded,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
this function does not
achieve an absolute min

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:90%
or absolute max.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.708 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to say is
that the assumptions that two--

00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:55.500 align:middle line:84%
so there's two assumptions
here, that we're

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
working on a closed
and bounded interval,

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and that f is continuous.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:84%
These two assumptions are
necessary for the theorem

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:90%
to be true.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, they are not
the most precise way

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of stating this theorem.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You could replace a closed
and bounded interval

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:84%
with what's called a compact
set, which maybe I'll

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.810 align:middle line:84%
put in the assignment
or on the midterm,

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:90%
depending on where there's room.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But just in the
setting of intervals,

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
the interval has to
be closed and bounded.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And the function has to be
continuous for this theorem

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:90%
to hold true.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
wanted to get at.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.790 --> 00:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we've proven, as I
said in this remark here,

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is that there exists two
numbers c and d in a, b,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.595 align:middle line:84%
so that f of a, b is
contained in f of c, f of d.

00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:15.610 align:middle line:84%
c would be where f
achieves an absolute min.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.955 align:middle line:84%
d would be where if f
achieves an absolute max.

00:39:18.955 --> 00:39:26.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is absolute max.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So now the question becomes,
do I hit everything in between?

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Does this inclusion
become equality?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I gave the game away at
the beginning of the lecture

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.860 align:middle line:90%
by saying, yes, it will.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's actually a theorem.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:58.927 align:middle line:84%
So this was the min-max theorem,
which I didn't call it that.

00:39:58.927 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I should have.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It's actually called
that in the notes.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to move
on to the intermediate value

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.840 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And first we're going to do
what looks like a special case,

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.515 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll prove
the general case.

00:40:14.515 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem,
which I'm actually--

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not called this
in the textbook.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to call it this,
which I'll call the bisection

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
method, is the following.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Let f be a function from a, b
to R if f of a is less than 0--

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and so, I need one more--

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:90%
be continuous.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're always in
the continuous setting

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:90%
for this section.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So if f of a is less than 0
and f of b is bigger than 0,

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
then there exists c and E in the
interval a, b such that f of c

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.660 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So the picture that goes on
with goes along with this is,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.960 align:middle line:90%
here's a, b.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Here's f of a.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:90%
f of b is positive.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if
it's continuous,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and you believe the
definition of a continuity

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that is
that I don't have

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.380 align:middle line:90%
to pick up my piece of chalk.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:90%
It pains me to say this.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's, again, not
the official definition,

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:90%
but one you keep in your head.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Since somebody probably
told you that at some point,

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
if I don't have to pick
up my piece of chalk,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
then eventually, I have
to cross the x-axis.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, at this
point c, f of c will be 0.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do I call this
theorem the bisection method?

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:84%
As we'll see, the way you
determine this c is by what

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:84%
in calculus books is called
the bisection method.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So for the proof,
let-- we're going

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to define a sequence
of numbers a in b

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.600 align:middle line:90%
and with special properties.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm first going to tell
you what a1 and b1 are.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.780 align:middle line:84%
a1 is just going to be
a, b1 is going to be b.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, now I'm
going to tell you

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:84%
how to choose the next element
in the sequence knowing

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.318 align:middle line:84%
the element in the
sequence before.

00:43:23.318 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to--

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:37.670 align:middle line:90%


00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:44.570 align:middle line:84%
first to find two
sequences a n and bn.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you
how to do that.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And the way we're
going to choose this

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.260 align:middle line:84%
is so that f of a sub n
is always less than 0,

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and f of b sub n is always
bigger than or equal to 0.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And there obtained from
the previous two guys

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
by taking the midpoint, so
bisecting the ones before.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:11.846 align:middle line:84%
So to get this started, a1
will be just a, b1 will be b.

00:44:11.846 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, for in a natural number,
we're going to define--

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:90%
so we know a1.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to
tell you how to define a2

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:90%
based on now you know a1.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm about to
write down will also

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:84%
tell you how to define a3,
since you now know how to do a2.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
write it this way.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:42.895 align:middle line:84%
For in a natural
number, knowing a sub n,

00:44:42.895 --> 00:44:52.265 align:middle line:84%
b sub n, we define a sub n
plus 1 and b sub n plus 1 as

00:44:52.265 --> 00:44:52.765 align:middle line:90%
follows.

00:44:52.765 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So if f of a sub n plus
b sub n-- so the midpoint

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:84%
between the two
guys that I already

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:18.910 align:middle line:84%
know-- so if you like, take n
to be 1 for when you first read

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:90%
how to define a sub 2, say.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm writing
down applies to every in.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:31.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So we take f of a sub n
plus b sub n over 2 to be,

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.770 align:middle line:84%
if this is bigger
than or equal to 0,

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:47.160 align:middle line:84%
then we define a sub n
plus 1 to be a sub n,

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and b sub n plus 1
to be the midpoint.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And if of the midpoint
is less than 0,

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:84%
then a sub n plus 1 is going
to be the midpoint, and b sub n

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.370 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 will be the
previous point.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:23.778 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- in fact,
so this is how you

00:46:23.778 --> 00:46:25.070 align:middle line:90%
define the sequence in general.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's walk through what
this means just for n

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.460 align:middle line:90%
equals 2 so that you see--

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.795 align:middle line:90%
you get the idea.

00:46:32.795 --> 00:46:34.295 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should have
done this first.

00:46:34.295 --> 00:46:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's draw a picture to go--

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.270 align:middle line:90%
in fact, I don't need this axis.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll just-- b.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So and this is a sub
1, this is b sub 1.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, we look
at the midpoint.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:03.450 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So we know that f of a
sub 1 is less than 0.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:14.760 align:middle line:84%
f of b sub 1 is
bigger than 0, which

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is certainly bigger
than or equal to 0

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:90%
if it's bigger than 0.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Now we look at the midpoint.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And based on the
sign of this guy

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.860 align:middle line:90%
will be how we define a2 and b2.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So for the sake of me
going through this,

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose that f of
this thing is less than 0.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Then I take, a2 will
be a1 plus b1 over 2.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And b2 will be b1.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, I look at the
midpoint of these two guys.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm at this stage, f
of a2 is less than 0, f of b2

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.010 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than 0.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in the picture
before, except now I'm

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.790 align:middle line:84%
at half the distance
between the two endpoints.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, I look at this point
now, a2 plus V2 over 2.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And I look at the sign of that.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And let's suppose
f of this thing

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:23.840 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 0.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I will take
this point to be a 3,

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and this point will now be b3.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I have is f of
a3 is less than 0, f of b3

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.745 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 0.

00:48:44.745 --> 00:48:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that the left
endpoint is always negative

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.120 align:middle line:90%
when I stick it into f.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The right endpoint is
always non-negative

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.490 align:middle line:90%
when I stick it into f.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And that the distance
between the two midpoints

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.745 align:middle line:84%
is always getting cut in half
by the previous distance before.

00:49:04.745 --> 00:49:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But we're always in the picture,
but kind of in the setting

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.760 align:middle line:90%
we were in the step before.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have three properties of
this sequence of a n's and bn's

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So for all n, they're
always bounded

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:42.510 align:middle line:84%
between the original
two endpoints.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, the a sub n's
are always moving to the right.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, a sub n
is always getting

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
replaced by the midpoint between
a sub n and b sub n, possibly,

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:00.970 align:middle line:90%
or staying the same.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So a sub n is always less than
or equal to a sub n plus 1.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, let me
write it this way.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.860 align:middle line:84%
We always have a sub n is
less than or equal to b sub n.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We always have a is less than
or equal to a n plus 1, which

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to a n.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:90%
And then, we also have--

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:46.500 align:middle line:90%
so for all in b.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm making a mess of
what I'm writing down.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's start this over.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So the first property
I want to write,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:08.710 align:middle line:84%
for all N natural numbers,
we have b, a sub n

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.410 align:middle line:84%
is always less than or
equal to a sub n plus 1.

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And b sub n plus 1,
remember, whenever--

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
change b, it's always

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.480 align:middle line:84%
to change it to the midpoint
between the previous guy

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and the a from
the previous step.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is always less
than or equal to b sub n.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, two, if I
look at the difference,

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:84%
this is always equal to 1/2
of the previous distance.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Because either one
of these are getting

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.250 align:middle line:90%
changed to the midpoint.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a sub
n plus 1, then b

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:84%
sub n plus 1 minus a sub n plus
1, is b sub n minus a sub n

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.955 align:middle line:84%
plus b sub n over 2,
which gives me this.

00:52:11.955 --> 00:52:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Three, for all n,
a natural number--

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is just based
on how we are choosing--

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.060 align:middle line:84%
we are doing this construction,
f of a sub n is less than 0,

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and f of b sub n is
bigger than or equal to 0.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.700 align:middle line:90%
So I hope this is clear.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.020 align:middle line:84%
All of these, if you like,
you could prove by induction.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:84%
For equals 1, this
is certainly true.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Assume it holds for
n equals m, and then

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.460 align:middle line:84%
prove all of these statements
here for n equals m plus 1.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.000 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just stating it as
clear from the construction,

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully it is.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.260 align:middle line:90%
So what does this give us?

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, by one, the
sequence is a sub n

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and b sub n are bounded,
because they're always

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:42.170 align:middle line:84%
bounded between a and
b monotone sequences.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:46.190 align:middle line:84%
a sub n is increasing,
b sub n is decreasing.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Thus, there exists limits.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
call them c and d.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But it has nothing to do with
the c and d from over here.

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:14.095 align:middle line:90%
Thus these sequences converge.

00:54:14.095 --> 00:54:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I.e, there exists
element c and d in a, b,

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:31.380 align:middle line:84%
such that limit as n goes to
infinity of a sub n equals c--

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:84%
again, the a sub n's and b
sub n's are between a and b.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So their limits will
also be between a and b--

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:41.960 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:90%
b sub n equals d.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, I claim c equals d.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Why should this not
come as a surprise?

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, the a n's and bn's
are getting very close.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.738 align:middle line:84%
They're always-- the distance
between any two of them

00:55:04.738 --> 00:55:05.780 align:middle line:90%
is always getting halved.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, a sub m minus b sub n,
this equals a sub n minus 1,

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:26.180 align:middle line:84%
minus b sub n minus 2 over 2,
which equals 1 over 2 squared,

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:84%
a sub n minus 2, minus b sub
n minus 2, dot, dot, dot.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this equals
1 over 2n minus 1 b sub 1

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:84%
minus a sub 1, equals 1 over
2 to the n minus 1, b minus a.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, c minus d,
which is equal to the limit

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:04.560 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity
of a sub n minus

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:11.100 align:middle line:84%
b sub n equals the limit as n
goes to infinity of 1 over 2

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to the n minus 1, b minus a.

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:84%
1 over 2 to the n minus
1 is converging to 0,

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:21.960 align:middle line:84%
times this fixed number,
b minus a, equals 0.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, these two
numbers, these two limits

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.160 align:middle line:90%
c and d equal each other.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So this step here is by
the second property here.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.912 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.912 --> 00:56:43.245 align:middle line:90%
And now, we're essentially done.

00:56:43.245 --> 00:56:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:58.312 align:middle line:84%
Using the third property,
by three and continuity,

00:56:58.312 --> 00:57:03.950 align:middle line:84%
if I look at f of c, since the
a sub n's are converging to c,

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:04.880 align:middle line:90%
this is equal to--

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.450 align:middle line:90%


00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and f of a sub n is
always less than 0.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So its limit is less
than or equal to 0.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:23.255 align:middle line:84%
And now, remember, c is also
equal to the limit of the b sub

00:57:23.255 --> 00:57:24.050 align:middle line:90%
n's.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by continuity, f
of c is equal to f of b sub n.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And the f of b sub n's
are always non-negative.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So their limit is also
bigger than or equal to 0.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So I've shown that
this number f of c

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.380 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to 0, and that it's also

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to 0.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, f of c equals 0.

00:57:48.260 --> 00:58:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.480 align:middle line:90%
So we use the--

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.010 align:middle line:84%
why I put the
bisection method here

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.570 align:middle line:84%
is because we used
a bisection method

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:11.490 align:middle line:84%
to prove this
theorem, which looks

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:20.320 align:middle line:84%
like a kind of a special case
of a certain intermediate value

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:20.870 align:middle line:90%
property.

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that I can always find
something, that if I have--

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that I can always find
something in the interval that

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.910 align:middle line:84%
achieves something in
between f of a and f of b.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.530 align:middle line:90%
In this case, it's just 0.

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:36.715 align:middle line:90%
But I can in fact upgrade this.

00:58:36.715 --> 00:58:39.385 align:middle line:90%


00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:46.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the following
theorem due to Bolzano

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.730 align:middle line:84%
so Bolzano's intermediate
value theorem.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:58.540 align:middle line:90%


00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Let f from a to b,
R be continuous.

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:20.210 align:middle line:90%
If y is between f of b--

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:23.330 align:middle line:84%
so meaning, let's say, so
we're in one of two cases.

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's say f of a is
less than f of b.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If y is between f
of a and f of b,

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:45.950 align:middle line:84%
then there exists a c in a,
b, such that f of c equals y.

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:53.740 align:middle line:84%
If f of a is, say,
bigger than f of b,

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and we take
something in between,

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.090 align:middle line:90%
the same conclusion holds.

00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:07.450 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So in short, if I take
anything between the value

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:14.290 align:middle line:84%
of the function evaluated at
the two endpoints a and b,

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
then the function achieves
that value at some point.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.930 align:middle line:90%


01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So if I take any
y between here, f

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
has to cross this
horizontal line.

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's achieved
at some point c.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And we'll deduce this from--

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
so this looks like a special
case of this intermediate value

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
theorem, if f of a is less than
0, f of b is bigger than 0,

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.340 align:middle line:90%
and y is equal to 0.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, you can reduce
this general statement

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to that special case
just by a simple trick.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So proof, suppose f of
a is less than f of b.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So we're in this first case.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And y is in f of a, f of b,
let g of x be f of x minus y.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
function of x and y. y

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
is a fixed number between
f of a and f of b.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is a function
going from f to b to R,

01:01:55.910 --> 01:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and which is continuous.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So sum of two continuous
functions is continuous,

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
f is a continuous
function by assumption.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.660 align:middle line:90%
This is just a constant minus y.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
So their sum is also continuous.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But now, if we look
at g of a, this

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.955 align:middle line:90%
is equal to f of a minus y.

01:02:20.955 --> 01:02:24.110 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, y is bigger than f of a,
since y is in f of a, f of b.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is less than 0.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And g of b is equal to f of
b minus y is bigger than 0.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by
the previous theorem,

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
there exists a c in
a, b, such that g of c

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:58.250 align:middle line:90%
equals 0, which means i.e.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
f of c equals y.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.480 align:middle line:90%


01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And the proof, assuming f
of a is bigger than f of b

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is similar, you just now
put y here minus f of x.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you put-- now you define g
of x would be y minus f of x.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make
a remark about that.

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:29.420 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Is similar, look at g of
x equals y minus f of x.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%


01:03:53.190 --> 01:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So Bolzano's intermediate
value theorem tells us

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that if I take any value
between the function evaluated

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
at the two endpoints, then that
value is achieved by something

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.005 align:middle line:90%
in between a and b.

01:04:17.005 --> 01:04:20.050 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this will, in
fact, give us that f of a, b

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
is equal to f of c, f
of d for some c and d.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is a simple
theorem from this.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:41.544 align:middle line:90%


01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Is continuous if
f local n at c--

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%


01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
not local, absolute min
at c and absolute max

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:34.365 align:middle line:84%
at d, then the image by f of a,
b is equal to f of c, f of d.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.240 align:middle line:90%
And what's the proof?

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, apply Bolzano's
intermediate value theorem

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to f now going from the
possibly smaller interval, c, d.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It could be d, c or
c, d, depending on

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
if the thing that I have to
stick in to f to get the min

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.502 align:middle line:84%
and the thing I have to
stick into f to get the max

01:06:05.502 --> 01:06:06.965 align:middle line:90%
is smaller than the other.

01:06:06.965 --> 01:06:13.680 align:middle line:90%


01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So apply the Bolzano's
intermediate value theorem

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
to this function
now just restricted

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:20.840 align:middle line:90%
to the smaller closed interval.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's still continuous.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:39.600 align:middle line:90%


01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.567 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I was a little
too fast with that.

01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:47.745 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say a couple
of more words about this.

01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:53.520 align:middle line:90%


01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me that everything
between the two values

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
f of c and f of d is achieved
by f on this interval.

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%


01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is a possibly
smaller interval than a, b.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is contained
in the range of f now

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.685 align:middle line:90%
of f of this larger interval.

01:07:31.685 --> 01:07:34.460 align:middle line:90%


01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And since we already
know that f of a, b

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is contained in f of c,
f of d, and now we've

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
proven the reverse
inclusion, this

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:54.285 align:middle line:84%
implies that f of c, f
of d equals f of a, b.

01:07:54.285 --> 01:07:55.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%


01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So I think we'll stop there.

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Next time, we'll finish
with a few remarks

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
about an application of the
intermediate value theorem.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll move on
to uniform continuity.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%

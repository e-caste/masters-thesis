00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:28.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So
today, we're going

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.259
to talk about labor
and development.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.130
There are several
pieces to this,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.840
just to sort of get into it.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.160
One, number one, back to
risk sharing, full benchmark,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.240
but this time with endogenous
labor supply and wage risk.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.470
And I'll mention sort of some
tests using that framework.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.330
I dumped a lot of
the excess slides,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.090
because I don't want that to be
the sole focus of the lecture

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.990
today, although it's kind of
the obvious starting point.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.440
With those lotteries,
basically, you

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
end up dealing with
a non-convexity.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.070
And then that has a lot to do
with estimating elasticities

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.350
of labor supply from
micro data versus what

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.570
you see in aggregate data.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.430
And we've learned
a lot about that.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
So there is sort of the
complete market's version.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.000
And then, a la lecture last
time, the incomplete market's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.660
version, where the aggregate
elasticity is higher, sometimes

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.770
a lot higher, than it is in
the micro data for reasons

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.660
of the aggregation.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.730
And since we've talked
about zoom in, zoom out,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.420
you know, micro, macro, that
seems like a relevant thing.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.110
And then we, in fact, end
the lecture with Seema's,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.570
Jayachandran, paper
on labor supply.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.680
And I think it was
India, with rainfall

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.870
and agricultural shock.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:18.420
So sharing wage risk,
I just said this.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.740
We have non-labor income, which
is like the y moving around

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.580
we've had before.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.740
But we also have
income from wages,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.840
but hours are endogenous.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110
Labor is not supplied
inelastically.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.470
And we're going to allow for
heterogeneity among individuals

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.610
in a household and
heterogeneity across households.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.440
So let me just lead
off with an example,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.790
because I think it makes
the points pretty well.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.630
And then we'll generalize.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.710
So you have two people,
or two households.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.260
One is risk neutral.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.420
The other risk averse.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.920
Why is this an obvious example?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.970
Because the risk neutral guy
should absorb all the risk

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.040
and would in every setup
that we've seen so far

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.840
and take it away
from the risk averse

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.390
guy, who's got a strictly
concave utility function.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.380
However, this guy cares about
leisure and consumption, not

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.730
just consumption.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.160
So typical Cobb-Douglas
specification

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.695
with some curvature, making
him strictly concave guy.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.060
If you don't consume leisure
in your work, that's supplied.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.588
You get this wage, W2.

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:41.880
When we generalize, we're
going to allow different wage

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.920
processes for different people,
not modeling necessarily

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.660
why they have different talent.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.530
But for now, there's only
one guy supplying labor.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.540
Again, y is this
non-labor income.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.000
T is the time endowment.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.100
Consumption good
is the numeraire.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.770
Wages are real.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.860
And there is a budget constraint
for this two-person programming

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.560
problem, which is like a small
open economy in the sense

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.070
that it's partial
equilibrium, and they

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.810
face these outside wages.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.060
In fact, these wages
may be moving around.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.960
It could be a village with two
people, something like that.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.890
Wages are determined in the
district or national level.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.130
This is the standard
budget constraint though.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.520
Call this thing full income,
if you remember Becker price

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.020
theory.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.170
So basically, it's as if
you supplied all the time

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.880
you have, cap T, hours
and days times the wage.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.550
You have this non-labor income.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.210
The community as
a whole has this.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.660
And then, you have
consumption and Mr. 2 at least

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.710
buys back leisure.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650
You know, well, it's
obvious, you could just

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.270
take time minus leisure.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.660
That would be labor supply and
put it on the right hand side.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.192
But it's kind of useful to
talk about leisure as a good,

00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:10.950
because that's what enters
the utility function.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.950
And we have some standard sort
of consumption sharing rules,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.700
division rules.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.520
Who's going to bear the risk?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.780
Well, it's going to turn out
that as we've done so far,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.350
this non-labor income risk
is going to be shared--

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.400
taken away entirely
by household 1.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.350
But things are much
more complicated

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.150
when it comes to the wage.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.480
The wage moves around,
and it changes income.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.170
But the wage also
represents a rate

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.870
of substitution between
consumption and leisure

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.750
for the group as a whole,
even though person 2

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.630
has to supply it.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.410
You know, the wage
goes way up, there's

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.590
kind of a change to
opportunity set for the group.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.870
And you can imagine
things should

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.485
move in order to be efficient
to take that into account.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.010
So we solved the
problem in two steps.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:17.850
And that's also going to make
it familiar in the sense of it

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.820
integrates with what we've
been talking about so far.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.270
First, ex post
inefficiency, suppose--

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.700
ex post efficiency-- this
is like the second welfare

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.200
theorem.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.370
But I'll tell you what I mean.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.710
Any Pareto optimal
allocation can

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.780
be supported among households
with a suitable lump sum

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.700
taxes and subsidies.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.730
Remember that theorem?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.040
OK, so what does it mean for us?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.700
You can kind of decentralize
the problem of the two people,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.220
as if one or later both can
supply labor on their own.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.590
But this lump sum
tax or transfer

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.540
is like an internal
redistribution

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.200
within the household.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.590
So for any target Pareto
optimal allocation,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.300
you can find a transfer and
then have each act in isolation,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.240
maximizing utility.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.980
And then step 2 is to take
sort of those indirect utility

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.350
functions, take a
step back in time

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.200
and maximize the ex
ante expected utility.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.700
And that's going to look like a
standard risk sharing problem.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.610
And in this case, for
this baby example,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.880
only member 2 is
supplying labor.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.890
Remember it was Cobb-Douglas,
and the power was basically 2.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.230
So basically here it's easier.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.530
You take 1/2 of
your full income.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.700
And that's your consumption.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.700
So those are those easy kind of
consumption expenditure rules.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.900
This is actually the same.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.940
You put the wage over here.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.510
The value of leisure is again
1/2 of your full income.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.050
So those are with
that functional

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.940
form standard leisure
consumption for household 2,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.750
plug it back into the
underlying utility function,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:16.450
raise it to a power, and you
may remember working this out

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.290
at some point in
some other course.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.620
You get a standard
indirect utility function

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:29.090
with all this stuff going on
in terms of these coefficients.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.910
Well, it's kind of obvious
that it had to end up this way.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:37.730
Note that the wage is in
here a couple of times,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.880
partly because the
full income and partly

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.840
because this guy's optimizing--

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.130
as the wage changed,
say, the allocation,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.670
the maximizing
allocation would change.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.290
You've got an
indifference curve,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.623
and you're going to change
the slope of the budget line.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.180
So now we take that
step back and consider

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.470
the overall maximum.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.750
But instead of having utility of
consumption directly of the two

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.140
members, we can use
the indirect functions.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.810
I mean, if you believed me,
then the indirect function

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.590
is without any restrictions.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.080
It's a natural object that
represents efficient ex post

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.980
optimization.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.730
Here's that row.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.250
Did I-- I should
have emphasized it.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.390
Row is the amount that
say 2 is getting from 1.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.700
Those are the
internal transfers.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.650
And household 2 optimizes
for a given row.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:55.570
So the ex ante allocation is
set the marginal utilities

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:01.280
basically equal to each
other, or equal to a constant.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.540
This constant would be the
ratio of Pareto weights.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.720
I'm not saying that two members
have to be treated equally

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.480
within the household.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.160
It could be very asymmetric.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.700
We usually have lambda 1 over
lambda 2, or mu 1 over mu 2,

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.990
or some ratio of those ex
ante given Pareto weights.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.970
That's all embedded up
here in the constant.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.740
Of course, convenient part
is the indirect utility

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.580
of household 1 is just linear,
because that person had

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.910
a utility that depended
only on consumption.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.800
And it was linear
in consumption.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.040
So we can now,
with this constant,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.000
if we carry it around
and multiply, you know,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.390
keep track that parameters
get added or multiplied

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.840
to it, that we can get a
closed form solution from this

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.090
for the transfer rule.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.370
And we already know what
consumption and leisure

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.690
are for person 2 as a
function of the transfer.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.870
So we solve that.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.420
And I don't know,
it's just algebra.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.120
What do you want
to see down here?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.580
Well, person 1's consumption
is moving around one to one

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.380
with non-labor income.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.050
So as anticipated, member 1
is absorbing all of that risk

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.120
and member 2 is
absorbing none of it.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:32.990
But the wage is affecting
consumption and more obviously

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.620
labor supply of person 2.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.840
And that wage is actually
affecting person 2 as well.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.130
Here it is down here in--

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.980
person 1, sorry, in terms
of person 1's consumption.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.190
And it's doing it in a
particular way basically.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.310
So this paper is called
sharing wage risk.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.360
And both these members
will share the wage risk,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.020
even though only person 2
can work more or less hours

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.890
at that wage.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.480
So in some sense,
leisure pooling

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:26.680
is a bit different from
consumption pooling in the way

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.660
that they're going
to want to adjust

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.000
their hours is going to depend
on the outside opportunities.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.980
So that's the summary.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.130
And then we'll
generalize this case.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.950
It's not general, because
person 1 was risk neutral.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.210
Here's the general case.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.410
There are S states of the world.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.910
There's a risk sharing group
of households, as in a village

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.260
or township or something.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.655
And every household H
has individual members.

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:00.230
It could be more than one.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.750
It's likely to be two or three.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.670
This is meant to be realistic.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.090
And we actually go to the data
with these specifications.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.500
And we have hours and
labor force participation

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.780
for every member
of the household.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.740
So we normally only have
consumption for the household.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.550
So we kind of throw
up our hands a bit,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.498
but here, we have labor at
the level of individuals.

00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:25.040
And we definitely
want to keep track.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.990
The consumption
of household H is

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.200
a sum of consumption
of individual members.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.530
That's true in theory,
even if we don't measure it

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.930
individually in practice.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.700
Aggregate consumption
in the village

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.240
is a sum of consumption
across the households.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.470
Nothing surprising there.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.170
Utilities of everyone
stays strictly increasing

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.385
and concave.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:58.880
And household H faces a vector
of wage and non-labor income

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.960
variation.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.170
You know the S is a subscript
on the wages of person

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.590
1, the wages of person
2, for how many people

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.120
there are in this household.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.920
And again, here
although it really

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.302
doesn't matter because we're
going to added up anyway,

00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:19.260
you could say different
people in the household

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.580
have different occupations.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.110
Some are helping on the farm.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.900
Other people run the
business exclusively.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.300
You could talk about
the non-wage income.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.460
If there's perfect markets,
which we're going to assume,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.000
then the profits
of the firm are as

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.870
if they had supply their
own labor to the market

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.490
and hire other labor to run the
business, which is problematic.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.680
But, you know, then you get
the usual sort of separation.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.350
And so these are really
like profit numbers.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.630
But this is the aggregate
of overall individuals

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.280
in the household.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.520
This is what we've been
calling household profits.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.060
And finally, the
resources available

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.390
are household profits plus
gifts and other things.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.870
These taus are not
yet determined.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:22.607
They're given for this household
H in state S. In a minute

00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:24.440
they're going to get
determined endogenously

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.355
from the rest of the village.

00:15:26.355 --> 00:15:27.980
So, again, we're
going to kind of solve

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.312
individual problems, household
problems, village problems,

00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:34.395
and sort of build upwards.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.940
So what does the household do?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.620
It maximizes these
new weighted sums

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:52.310
of utilities of its individual
members, summing over states.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.320
And actually, we
could sum over dates.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.570
But you already know
that doesn't matter.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.960
There's nothing you know
particularly inter-temporal

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.300
about this--

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.550
well, these sub-problems
apply even when

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.560
the household as a whole
can borrow and lend

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.210
with the outside, et cetera.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.740
And just simplify by
getting rid of that for now.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.000
Common probability over states
S. Utilities are allowed

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.720
to depend on individual i.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.900
We're going to try to retain as
much heterogeneity as possible,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.390
although it's sometimes
problematic how much we

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.250
can allow in the data.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.030
And here's the sort of
collective resource constraint

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.200
for the household H.
It's the same as before.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.710
We're just summing over
all the individual members.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:47.950
This is the sum consumption,
sum of the valuation of leisure,

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.150
equal to full income,
including any taxes

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.632
or subsidies the
household is getting

00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:55.840
from the rest of the village.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.250
These Pareto weights mu
are kind of taken as given.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.190
That's not to say there aren't
forces that determine them--

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.089
you know, the marriage
market, one person

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.700
has a lot more income than the
other, all this bargaining.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.660
But any bargaining that takes
place here is entirely ex ante.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:24.710
And it is assumed to be fixed
and unalterable subsequently

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.869
as states of the
world are realized.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.370
You know, we haven't talked
about it in this class.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.590
I think you've probably
seen it in other classes,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.960
this whole literature
on the unitary household

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.380
and, you know, ex
post bargaining,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.160
when opportunities of the
spouse increase and so on.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.300
They may take more goods.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.690
They may better dictate
what household is consuming.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.070
That's all suppressed here.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:54.030
It's buried in these
fixed Pareto weights.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.810
The idea is to see how far we
can get even assuming that.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.850
OK, well, then we have
the Marshallian demand.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.280
I only say that with
emphasis because we're

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.130
going to go Hicks and
Frisch in a minute.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.030
But this is the regular
demand for leisure

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.450
that solves the individual's
optimization problem.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.410
This is an individual
i in household H.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.350
This, apart from the
more cumbersome notation,

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.870
is exactly what we
went through before.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.370
This is some transfer that
individual i is getting

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.013
in state S from the rest--

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:35.930
giving or getting from
the rest of the members

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.680
of the household.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.590
This is the
valuation of the time

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.210
endowment for individual i.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.900
And in the left-hand side
is the sum of expenditures

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.800
on consumption and leisure.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.720
And that after maximization
gives you the indirect utility

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.560
function, which clearly
depends on the wage

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.780
and on this transfer.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:16.310
So for the household to
have an objective function,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:22.570
we can call it sort of
the Pareto mu weighted sum

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.410
of the value functions
of the individuals.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.050
Again, we went through
this in the baby example

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.205
at the beginning.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.730
And then the problem
of the village--

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.640
note that now we summed over H--

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:45.780
is to maximize this household
by household expected utility,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.920
and now making it expected
because it's conditioned

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.590
on state S. And here's the
constraint that these transfers

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.230
stay within the
village have to add up

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.800
to zero if the village is
the risk sharing group you

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.590
want to be considering.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.800
One first order
condition, you know,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.740
basically says that the marginal
utility of the household

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:23.990
respective transfers in state
S is just pre-multiplied

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.900
by the probability and
then this lambda HS--

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.740
so this lambda HS is
like the shadow price

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.520
on the budget constrain
of the household at state

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.740
S. It reflects
how tight or loose

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.600
the optimization
problem is, just

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.360
like in standard price theory.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.040
It's just the
Lagrange multiplier

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.780
on the budget constraint.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.820
It's also going to
equal something else.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.452
But so far I haven't talked
about it in the notation.

00:20:55.452 --> 00:20:56.910
It's going to equal
something else,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.820
because these sum of
the transfers are zero.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.720
So there's like a collective
resource constraint that isn't

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.250
written out here explicitly.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.970
And that thing is going to
pick up a Lagrange multiplier.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.610
And that Lagrange
multiplier is going

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.630
to be common over
all the households,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.800
just like it was for
the consumption problem.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:27.160
OK, so here's an example,
Cobb-Douglas coefficients

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.350
are depending on i and
H raised to a power.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.570
This obvious generalization
of the example.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.990
We have a little corner
to worry about here.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.160
You know, the way to see
this is putting w over here,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.250
this is the
expenditures on leisure.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.815
And expenditures on leisure
ought to be equal to--

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.642
well, these add up
to 1, basically--

00:21:57.642 --> 00:22:00.400
I almost think that's a typo.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.490
Should be 1 minus alpha--

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.180
the expenditure
share on leisure.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:16.140
But what happens if this
amount, given this full income,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.480
this leisure that individual
i is supposed to be consuming,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.450
exceeds his time endowment?

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.825
Then you've hit
a binding corner.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.150
So hence the min, which is
this cannot exceed this.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.760
When it's less, it's no problem.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.830
You just when hours are
less, you do those hours.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.860
When hours are more,
you do the max.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:50.200
Now, let me just say this is
very natural in this problem

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.500
when the time
endowment is fixed.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.390
But you could also imagine
other indivisibilities.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.810
You could imagine that
you could only supply

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.280
discrete amount of hours.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.930
Or something like in
the US, typically you

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.660
have 8-hour days and 40-hour
weeks, and that's it.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.150
And you can't vary your hours.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.210
So you can load other
restrictions in here.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.310
And in the data, there
is enormous variability

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.230
in non-participation.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.510
Month by month,
households will sit out

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.660
for substantial periods
of times and then re-enter

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.540
the labor force.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.215
So something is
making that happen.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.000
And actually, it's
the other corner.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.380
It's more like zeros, not
working up to the max.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.420
Yes?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.420
AUDIENCE: So it only
gets a corner solution

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.160
if that household's Pareto bases
is too large for that agent?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.440
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
one of the factors.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.450
No, too small.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.000
So-- oh, too large,
sorry, leisure.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.730
And I just made a
mistake, absolutely, yeah.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.180
So when the Pareto weight is
high and leisure is valued,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.130
then they want to
do maximum leisure.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.710
They set leisure equal to the
time endowment and work hours

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.030
are zero.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:16.645
So that's one thing, but
it depends on the wage.

00:24:16.645 --> 00:24:18.020
And it's actually
going to depend

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.770
on how binding the household's
resource constraint is.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.360
So there's two other factors.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.610
But you're right about
the Pareto weight.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.800
So we can solve out for the
value functions in these work

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.390
and no work branches.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.280
I'm not sure that is
very enlightening.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.840
There is going to be a
critical wage, as I was just

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.080
anticipating, where that
constraint is binding

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.480
or not if the wages are higher
than this critical number,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.090
the individual would be working.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.110
And if it's lower than
that critical number,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.290
they're not going to be working.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.550
So there is a threshold.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.020
And it turns out it's
smooth as the wage-- there's

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.630
no jumps in this
problem, at least.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.490
You can see it in
the value functions.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.000
You can see it in the
way the wage moves.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.760
But again, I don't
think it's worth getting

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.870
bogged down in the algebra
to make that point.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.820
In other words, hours
will kindly smoothly

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.610
stay at zero until the wage
goes above this threshold.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:35.920
And then hours will start
to pick up in a regular way.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.940
So here's what I just
mentioned to Yeng,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.170
which is that households are
less likely to participate when

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:50.610
the wage is low, when the
household is doing well,

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.410
and when the Pareto
weight is large.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.310
Or conversely, you'll see
greater participation,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.400
and condition on
participation, greater hours

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.040
when the wage is high, when
the household is doing badly,

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:15.670
meaning that the shadow price on
the budget constraint is high,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.160
and when this person's
Pareto weight is small.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.630
You know, make the slaves work.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.480
This looks awful.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.330
It supposed to be a
good thing that we

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.740
are able to analytically solve.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.080
So let me highlight something.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.190
There's two equations
on the slide.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.130
There's a reservation wage
and an hour's equation.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.630
OK?

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.150
Actually look down here first.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.450
The reservation wage for
individual i in the household h

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:07.440
has a constant
term and something

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.230
that depends on the shadow
price of the budget.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.770
Now, when we did the
consumption risk sharing thing,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.070
we talked about the shadow
price of consumption.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.300
I'm kind of like tongue tied.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.920
I don't quite know
what to call it.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.620
It's more than
consumption, because we

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.970
have leisure in this problem.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.050
But we did have a
budget constraint.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.340
So it's the shadow price
on the budget constraint.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.480
And there's no H on this guy,
because this thing represents

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.570
that all the individuals and all
the households in the village

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.920
are pooling all this risk.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.270
So there's like a common
community level resource

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.740
constraint.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.510
That's the content
of the theory.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.580
And here's hours actually
worked when working.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.780
And again, it has
a constant term.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:03.170
It has this same shadow
price object, DS,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.200
in it, and also on the wage.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.760
Now, the wage just
reflects the fact that,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.720
as we said before,
the higher the wage,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.110
the more you're likely
to make someone work.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.450
And so now we can maybe get
the courage to go back up

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.910
and look at what all
these objects are.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.710
Look at all the
beautiful restrictions

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:42.230
that theory is placing on
these regression coefficients.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.750
First of all, why
all the i's and h's?

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.380
Well, we allowed a
lot of heterogeneity

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.410
in those Cobb-Douglas
coefficients and the curvatures

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.760
for each of the households.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.560
Let's spot some familiar--
this is all preference stuff.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.330
This is cool for me.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.830
This is the log of the
probability weighted shadow

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:26.190
price in the whole village.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.970
And what's this?

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.020
This is the risk aversion.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.770
So you remember that stuff
about risk tolerance?

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:40.050
So, you know, the greater gamma,
the less risk tolerant they

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.740
are--

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.085
sorry, going the wrong way.

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:46.730
This gamma is the curvature
in the utility function.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.890
So-- oh, there's a
negative sign there, right.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.400
So basically what it's
saying is the more risk

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.370
averse that an
individual is, the less

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.310
you should see that its
hours are moving around

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.660
with this aggregate state.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.780
So that's the leisure version
of the consumption equations

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.470
we had before.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.340
I mean here's Pareto weights
in here, for example,

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.610
in the critical wage threshold.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.590
This is the Pareto
weight of the household.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.020
This is the Pareto
weight of the individual.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.260
And the higher this thing
is, the higher that wage

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.810
is going to be, because
that's basically

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.370
the way you take your leisure.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.122
Yes?

00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:47.180
AUDIENCE: So before
we were talking

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.690
about it's great to see all
these restrictions because

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.340
of being familiar with the
data and doing regression.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.740
But we will never have data
on a Pareto weight, right?

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.350
That's not a real thing?

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.700
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.390
But--

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.640
AUDIENCE: If that's correlated
with other stuff that's

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.830
going to start moving
around the other betas

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.553
that we're estimating on
the stuff we can see, right?

00:31:09.553 --> 00:31:11.720
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, but
basically-- that's right.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.850
And that's what
this is basically.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.510
So you start looking at what
the regression coefficients are.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.970
For example, here's this
one thing, the risk aversion

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.900
of individual i and household
h, and there's an F on there.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.960
So where was the F thing?

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.450
The F thing was what I was
highlighting right here.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.290
So now this is a fixed effect.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.430
We don't see it.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.370
But you can put a time
bearing fixed effect

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.290
for the whole village.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.170
And then estimate this
regression coefficient.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.830
And the theory is telling you
that's 1 over the coefficient

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.750
of relative risk aversion.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:58.610
And so now you can work
backwards, you know--

00:32:03.268 --> 00:32:04.810
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
that be correlated

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.448
with the Pareto weight on me?

00:32:06.448 --> 00:32:07.750
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Mm, hmm.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.270
No.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.840
No, we didn't see that in the--

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.970
AUDIENCE: Oh, no,
sorry, what I meant

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.730
is if I don't have
the Pareto weight--

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.635
so that'll be like
fixed effect, right?

00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:21.760
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The Pareto
weights is like a fix--

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.140
this is a time
bearing fixed effect.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.070
And the Pareto weights
are going to show up--

00:32:30.705 --> 00:32:31.330
where are they?

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:32.860
Over here.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.142
Here's one.

00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:35.350
AUDIENCE: Can you have some--

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.642
ROBERT TOWNSEND: This is the
households' Pareto weight.

00:32:37.642 --> 00:32:39.790
This is the individual's
Pareto weight.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.850
Granted there's a little bit
of these alphas to worry about.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.540
So we'll have to grab them.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.170
But part of this
fixed effect, this

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.990
is not varying with time
or states or anything else.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.240
AUDIENCE: So you can have
like an individual effect is

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.370
what you're saying.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.287
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.500
So that's sort
of-- the algebra is

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.290
if you had all these regression
coefficients and so on,

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:13.450
then you basically can identify
almost all these parameters.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.780
The thing that you
can actually get

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:21.050
is the absolute value
of the risk tolerance.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.840
And we actually
saw that earlier.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.440
It's the ratio of the risk
tolerance of household i

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.560
relative to other members
that you're actually

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.270
able to identify.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.300
You can see who's more risk
averse than others, but not--

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.360
OK, and actually the paper
itself goes through--

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.090
it's long.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.060
I'm afraid it's quite tedious--

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.160
goes through, you know,
this parametric example.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.650
It actually goes through
non-parametric stuff.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.310
Pierre-Andre has figured
out with his co-authors

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.760
how to identify tons of stuff,
just based on labor supply,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.060
even though there's all
this underlying consumption

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.820
stuff going on.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.560
You use data from Britain.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.010
OK.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.491
So yep?

00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:08.699
AUDIENCE: So you starting
out with the multiplication

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:13.309
that consumption will
have to equal to waste.

00:34:13.309 --> 00:34:14.790
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.643
AUDIENCE: But your
paper in 1994--

00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:19.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.822
AUDIENCE: So how do you
reconcile with this?

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.090
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, I mean,
the first answer was, you know,

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.889
I assumed the problem away.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:31.909
Actually, not quite.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.989
If you look, you'll see that
I had put measures of hours

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.840
in the consumption equations.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.150
I was aware of this even then.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.820
But it certainly would be
easy to make a mistake.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.260
And people are often critical,
like puzzled, how can you

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.940
say income shouldn't matter?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.880
And here, we are
distinguishing the income

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.520
that's coming from labor
supply versus the income that's

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.230
non-labor.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.460
And it matters.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.450
The theory places
restrictions on how.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.650
So in some sense, consumption
does move with income.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.150
If the wage is moving income,
then it's moving consumption.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.874
And it's moving
consumption of everyone.

00:35:14.874 --> 00:35:17.580
AUDIENCE: Not quite generally.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.370
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, it's just
from the first order conditions

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.550
of the optimum problem,
the baby example

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.433
that I gave at the
very beginning.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.150
AUDIENCE: So why are we
testing a social planning

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.750
problem instead of
competitive equilibrium.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.365
Is that because Thailand
economy is centrally--

00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:43.240
ROBERT TOWNSEND: There
is no social planning.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.030
AUDIENCE: Isn't just to see how
close we get to the benchmark?

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.080
First of all, it's not
a particular benchmark,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.680
because those fixed effects--

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.264
we want to see where we are
in the whole frontier, right?

00:35:59.264 --> 00:36:01.295
AUDIENCE: I guess there's
a menu of benchmarks.

00:36:01.295 --> 00:36:02.170
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.680
So the idea is somehow like
sort of a closed thing,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.180
that you wouldn't leave,
quote, "surplus on the table."

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.450
That there must be
markets or institutions

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.010
or other arrangements that lead
them toward efficient outcomes.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.560
But, yeah, it's not like--

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.520
it's interesting that you're
against the social planner.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:31.390
It's-- and I often slip, and
you caught me the other day,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.910
saying, you know, social
planner this and that when I did

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.060
the capital asset model.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.250
That's just a metaphor for--

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.440
it's as if the
community as a whole

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.380
is allocating resources so
as to not lose any surplus.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.720
Now, you know, exactly
what the institution--

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.630
so I should tell you
about what we find.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.550
First of all, in these
villages, there's

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.090
something called labor
exchange arrangements.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.640
And it's partly
with the rice thing.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.240
You know, the low land
gets flooded early.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.310
They all go down and help
that guy farm his land.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:13.450
And then as the water rises,
they flood the other plots.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.420
But they don't charge
each other for the labor.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.120
It looks like free
labor exchange.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.410
And it doesn't necessarily
balance out either.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.530
Now, I'm not saying in any given
economy you'd be lucky enough

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.820
to observe something like that.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.120
But in these villages
you actually do

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.370
have a real institutional
counterpart that might explain

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.710
how they managed to do so well.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.290
Yes?

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.665
AUDIENCE: So I'm not sure it
would matter for this model.

00:37:41.665 --> 00:37:43.410
But the story you
told is that there's

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.160
several risk
sharing arrangements

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.250
for a different domain.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.490
That one was labor
opportunities.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.500
Maybe there's a separate
one for consumption.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.100
Would it matter-- from
what perspective would it

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.250
matter if there were
one unified arrangement?

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.130
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No,
it wouldn't matter.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.480
But, you know, it's nice
to be able to say something

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.610
about what the mechanism is.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.310
You know, for some people
just looking at outcomes

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.480
isn't totally convincing.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.940
I must say when
I started this, I

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.480
thought it was a virtue to
say we don't care how it's

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.100
done, I'm not going to look
separately as savings accounts,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.150
selling bullocks, borrowing,
running down your grain stores,

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.700
let's just look at the total.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:30.140
But still people want to know
how it could possibly happen.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.970
So what's going
on in these data?

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.590
Well, I spare you
all the details.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:42.510
But we put non-labor income
on the right-hand side

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.890
of the participation equations
and the labor supply equations.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:53.290
And the coefficient on it is
small and quite negligible.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.080
I mean, it's not zero.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.910
So we reject.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:59.730
But, you know, if
you come at this--

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.700
and we'll see this
in Seema's paper--

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.870
if you come at this from the
traditional point of view

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:10.920
in development, it would be
like labor supply is your safety

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.450
net.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.270
If you're getting your income
is really low from crops,

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.580
then migrate out,
work for wages.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.510
And this says,
well, not so fast.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:25.860
It might be done at
a community level.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.010
And the test of it would
be whether how well you're

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.580
doing on your own land has any
influence on your participation

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.540
and your labor supply.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.980
If they're pooling
risk like this,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.430
it shouldn't once you control
for, say, village level

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.250
fixed effects.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.110
And, in fact, you reject.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:46.710
But the coefficients are tiny.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.960
They really are sharing a lot
of this risk, not all of it,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.030
but a lot of it.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:00.790
OK, one last thing just to
tie some of this literature

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.420
to-- oh, god.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.810
So this thing, this is
like a famous parameter,

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.500
because it's called
the Frisch elasticity.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:19.500
And that brings to the next
part of this lecture, which

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.930
is this tension between the
small estimates, micro level

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:30.690
estimates, of labor elasticities
compared to what we seem

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:36.840
to need in a model to
get aggregate hours

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.890
and participation and
move around so much.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.895
Now, this literature spans
micro and macro and development.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:57.540
From the macro side,
Chetty reviewed all of it.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.400
But, you know,
Sargent, for example,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.320
but way back to Rogerson
and Hansen talk about a way

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.020
I'm going to show you
an indivisibility that

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:14.270
makes the overall aggregate
elasticities a lot

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.190
higher than you would get if
you looked at those individuals

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.990
in the data.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.190
So again, just to
anticipate, this

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.040
is a bit like zooming
out and zooming in.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.440
You zoom in to the individuals.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.120
If you have labor
supply and so on,

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.270
you can estimate their
micro level elasticities.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.430
And there's just
tons of literature,

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.530
which I suppressed
from the slides,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.220
because it will overwhelm
you of the interest

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.770
in estimating
those elasticities.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.990
But you could say all
these individuals reside

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.910
in a village or district.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.240
Let's look at what happens
when there's a rainfall shock.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.580
Let's look at aggregate--

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.120
how much the wage is moving
as a function of the rainfall

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.750
shock and try to
estimate from there

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.260
how inelastic labor supply is.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.720
And it's natural that
aggregate up over individuals

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.060
to get an aggregate
labor supply if you're

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:14.000
talking about how district
wages move around with rainfall.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.930
Well, that's Seema's
paper at the end.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:20.230
She's seemingly not aware,
and she didn't make a mistake.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.680
But it would be quite easy
to make a mistake if you were

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.160
quantitatively trying to
reconcile the data that you

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.400
use in the aggregate with
the micro level elasticities.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.310
And so that's, as
it turns out, been

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:41.510
the focus of this of
this macro literature, so

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.770
many elasticities.

00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:47.300
And partly because the
different literatures

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.270
developed different jargon.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:53.320
There is the
Hisksian elasticities

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.350
and the Frisch elasticities.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:01.210
A Hisksian elasticity is
basically compensated.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.490
So when you have
a wage change, you

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.840
don't just look at total hours.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.320
You push people back to the
original indifference curve

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.480
and slide along it.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.910
That's Hicks.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.510
Frisch has to do with
variation that you

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.330
would see if you held the
marginal utility of wealth

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.000
constant.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.920
Why does that come up for us?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.690
Oh, risk sharing.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.960
The marginal utility
of wealth is basically

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.980
at each date and state constant
over all the individuals.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.300
It's a very natural object and
related to the risk sharing

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.560
literature.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.410
And then macro, they call--

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.450
just to add Frisch elasticity.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.390
But it's of aggregate hours.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.660
And every one of these things
has extensive and intensive.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.800
And that's because there's a
big variation in participation,

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.060
not just hours in any data
that people have looked at.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.370
I'm not sure Chetty did this.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.800
I'm not so sure
how helpful it is.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:11.450
But the idea is the Hicks
effect is like shifting a wage.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.420
And you're going to shift it--

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.890
if you're going to
distinguish age,

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.220
you shift it over the
entire age profile.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.410
That's the way he
thinks about it.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.660
Whereas he thinks about
the Frisch elasticity

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.835
as just one little instant.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.280
I have trouble relating,
but anyway this is--

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.570
and then there's this table.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:50.460
These are micro estimates of
the intensive means conditioned

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.180
on working, how much your hours
are varying with your wage.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.790
These are, quote unquote,
"relatively low" numbers,

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.840
0.3, 0.5.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.040
The extensive margin is in the
micro data also not big, 0.1,

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.980
0.2.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.960
What this literature is
about is aggregate hours.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.220
Aggregate hours have
higher elasticities

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.590
than any of those numbers.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:29.570
And in particular this
thing, this macro level,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.325
Frisch elasticity is huge.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:44.440
So in order to generate this
number that we see in the data,

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.620
and keep the micro
parameters that you're

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.630
going to fit in, to be
consistent with that you have

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:57.630
to generate a huge elasticity
on the extensive margin somehow.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.255
So this is about trying to
reconcile micro with macro.

00:46:05.255 --> 00:46:07.710
AUDIENCE: Is that
bottom line, they're

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.940
not estimates from the data?

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.410
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Which one?

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.532
AUDIENCE: The bottom line.

00:46:12.532 --> 00:46:13.990
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, they're not.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:17.000
Although this is like that.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.890
So let's respect the
data on that dimension.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.230
And somehow create a very
big number here somehow--

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.360
and I'll tell you
how in a minute--

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.000
in order to get what we
see in the data over here.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.900
Now, in the original slides--

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.220
I'll give them to you--

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.310
there's like six
slides that now come

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.860
you know with all these other
who did this and which author

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.430
and so on.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:45.440
And I just felt that was going
to be bewildering and certainly

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.310
time consuming.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:47.220
So I'm skipping it.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.930
But here's what I
already went through.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.140
And I guess I said this too.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.030
So the punch line
is going to be if we

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:17.680
have a non-convexity
in participation,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.170
like you either have to work
full-time or not at all,

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:20.800
is an extreme.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.190
And then we go through the
mechanics of how people

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.260
would behave in that economy.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.580
We can generate a sort of
pseudo representative consumer.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.830
So that it looks as
if the aggregate are

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:41.543
generated as a solution to
that representative household.

00:47:41.543 --> 00:47:43.460
And the trick is that
representative household

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.830
is going to end up with
a Frisch elasticity

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:54.100
in the pseudo function, which
will allow huge variability

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.555
in aggregate hours.

00:47:55.555 --> 00:47:58.016
It responds to wages.

00:47:58.016 --> 00:47:59.690
Yep.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:05.810
AUDIENCE: This doesn't match
the extensive margin micro data.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.809
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Because
it doesn't have to.

00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:08.392
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:48:11.287 --> 00:48:13.620
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Because you
can populate the underlying

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.180
individuals with actual observed
micro estimates and then say

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.360
there is this inelasticity.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.370
I'll show you.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:23.970
I'll show you.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:31.060
OK, so we have labor,
capital, and output.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.160
Let's just do a single period.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.650
Imagine for a minute it's
not stochastic either.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:42.150
We have an aggregate
production function,

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:48.737
as a function of aggregate
capital and aggregate hours

00:48:48.737 --> 00:48:49.570
Why are we doing it?

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.600
This is basically
just going to allow

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.210
us to close the model
instead of having

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.720
it open partial equilibrium.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.050
So we're going to get the
wage and interest rate off

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.800
of this thing.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.990
It's convenient.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:10.750
There are a continuum of
individuals indexed by i.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.125
Each individual has one unit
of time, one unit of capital.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.277
Time is indivisible.

00:49:19.277 --> 00:49:21.610
And you got to choose, you're
either going to do leisure

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.300
or you're going to do work.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.358
So that's an extreme version
of the indivisibility.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.560
They care about
consumption and leisure,

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.200
or the disutility of work.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:43.380
But this work level is
either 0 or 1 by assumption.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.350
So let's just normalize
and say v of 0 is 0.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.800
But v of 1 is whatever it is.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.600
Let's call it m.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.740
It's just a real number,
because you're never

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.240
going to see at the
individual level

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.920
any other levels of hours.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:02.320
So remember m is the
disutility of working 1--

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.850
putting all your time into work.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.560
What's the consumption
set in this economy?

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.740
Consumption is non-negative.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.220
You can't supply more
capital than what you own.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:23.060
But you have this non-convexity
in the labor decision.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:23.810
It's 0, 1.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.580
This is not an interval 0 to 1.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.000
It's either 0 or 1.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.655
It's the set consisting
of just the two objects.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.920
So it's a non-convex
consumption set.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.895
Linear combinations of
0 and 1 are not allowed.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:53.520
OK, so what would be a
competitive equilibrium?

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.720
Households max, firms
max, markets clear.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.240
Here's the household
max problem.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:05.010
For any individual i, solve
for the consumption decision

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:09.300
about participation and the
capital respecting the budget

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:09.870
constraint.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.600
Namely, you can work or not--

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.610
so this is either 0 or something
positive-- at a given wage.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.810
And then you get the rental
rate on your capital stock.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:25.190
And that's that.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:30.020
Firms maximize profits,
paying factors of production.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.030
Clearly for a given
f, this is going

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.970
to generate marginal
products of capital and labor

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.050
in the whole economy.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:52.190
And if we just solve
the problem this way,

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.540
we could get an equilibrium.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.560
But it might not be optimal.

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:07.420
We can make people better
off by sort of randomizing

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.830
who gets to work.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.120
How are we going to do that?

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.960
We're going to basically create
this probability object phi.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:24.780
So here would be the
expected utility given a phi.

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.470
The realization with
probability phi,

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.190
you're going to be the
worker in this economy.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:34.700
With probability 1 minus phi,
you're just not going to work.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.930
And at the moment, you can
get different consumption

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.780
for the two different branches.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.280
Yep?

00:52:43.862 --> 00:52:45.320
AUDIENCE: I sort
of understand this

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.785
is getting at which the
market might be flexible.

00:52:48.785 --> 00:52:49.910
There's not much part-time.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.620
There's not much
intensive margin.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.800
So people turn to things like
household and they specialize.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.020
But how do you interpret
the lottery as--

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.060
like we imposed
lumpiness of working.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.090
And then we use the
lottery to break it.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:10.930
Why not have some other way
of having other types of labor

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:11.430
worked?

00:53:14.394 --> 00:53:24.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Um--
well, I'm about to show you

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:29.390
on the next slide the decision
problem for an insurance

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:30.700
company.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.720
And the insurance
companies like pooling over

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.630
all the individuals.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.570
And it's going to maximize, and
there's going to be free entry.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.970
And that's going to drive
the prices of certain things

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.790
to be equal to their
actuarial values.

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:49.920
So it's as if people were
buying and selling insurance.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.825
And they get to choose--

00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:00.620
they're not forced
as if by a planner

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.550
to work or not work depending
on how the roulette wheel turns.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.470
They actually get to
choose voluntarily

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:14.450
whether to decide to work
full time, decide to work zero

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:15.890
or be on call.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.470
They'd be on call, they're
going to get a wage that's

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.410
proportional to the
probability, because that's

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:23.248
the pooling aspect of it.

00:54:23.248 --> 00:54:24.960
AUDIENCE: Like [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.830
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, so far.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.330
Yeah.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.470
AUDIENCE: I don't know that the
lottery is so great, because it

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:35.240
could be we have like some of us
turn up for the job interviews,

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.513
and the people doing the
job interviews like just--

00:54:38.513 --> 00:54:40.430
you know, they're picking
based on some stuff.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:42.200
Maybe it's just as
good as random, right?

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.972
Like so--

00:54:43.972 --> 00:54:44.930
AUDIENCE: That's crazy.

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:45.888
AUDIENCE: No, it's not.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.055
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Disconcerting maybe.

00:54:51.055 --> 00:54:54.440
AUDIENCE: Suppose there are like
100 unskilled manual laborers

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.930
turned up for a job that
requires 30 laborers.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.520
I cannot observe past
project of these laborers.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.360
Like I can maybe
observe cleanliness

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.810
and they're ability to speak.

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:04.133
Like that's about it.

00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:05.300
So what am I supposed to do.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.675
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
So that would be

00:55:06.675 --> 00:55:09.590
an institutional arrangement,
where the markets seem

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:13.820
not to clear, because not
everyone gets the allocation,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.150
not everyone supplies labor.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.560
You know, they're lined
up on the street corner,

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.200
and the truck comes by, and
there are only so many jobs.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.950
AUDIENCE: But what if
we were indifferent,

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.005
then it would still be--

00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:26.130
ROBERT TOWNSEND: But there
are other ways to do it.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:31.540
I mean you could have sunspot.

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.020
You can even index off
of observable things

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.990
like rainfall.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:39.970
And then it would look
like a state contingent

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:45.998
contract, where the labor supply
is a function of the rainfall.

00:55:45.998 --> 00:55:48.040
But that doesn't mean
everyone's supplying labor.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.180
They have some arrangement.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.350
If it's sunny, I'm working.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:53.220
If it's raining, you're working.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.080
And it would be
very hard to say,

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.480
unless you were
very clear headed,

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.410
whether it's this sort
of extraneous risk

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:04.990
or some intrinsic risk,
some underlying state

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.500
that they were trying
to insure against.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.355
This last interpretation
is Arrow's interpretation

00:56:11.355 --> 00:56:11.980
of the lottery.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.020
And he's entitled.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:26.810
OK, so we're going to have these
prices, rental rates and wage

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:31.010
rates, normalizing
the consumption good.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.800
OK, here's the
insurance company thing.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:46.540
Basically, if you're working,
you pay a premium ex post.

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:52.530
And if you're not working,
you get this indemnity.

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.220
Well, I mean intuitively
if you're working,

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:03.440
you have more income, you
kind contribute some back

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.520
to the pool.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:10.760
But if an insurance company
we're offering this,

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.880
they would potentially
make profits

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.250
depending on the fraction
of the people from whom they

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:19.520
get the premium and
the residual fraction

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.920
to whom they pay the indemnity.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.140
If you have free
entry into insurance,

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.140
then this is going to drive
this equation to zero.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:28.640
OK?

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.030
So that's going to tie the
premia and the indemnity

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:40.005
to the probability or
fraction of people working.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.172
So now, we're going
to decentralize it.

00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:49.380
We're going to say look it's
as if the household were

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.860
maximizing expected utility, but
as I said, voluntarily deciding

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.800
whether to work for sure or
not work at all or something

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.240
in between.

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:04.498
And then they're going to
have this resource constraint.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.700
But I've now substituted in--

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.240
the x's entered
into consumption.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.570
But the x's we're constrained
by that zero profit condition.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.690
So we've substituted in
the zero profit condition

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:30.700
back into the household
budget constraint

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.790
and gotten this equation.

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:35.410
Capital is equal to 1.

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:38.250
So this thing's just going
to go to 1 no matter what.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.670
You're going to get a wage.

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:42.310
But you're basically
going to be paid

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.670
the expected value of
your pre-committed labor

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.950
participation.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:49.240
I agree to be on call.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.030
A hospital may call me.

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:55.280
I'm going to go to
work if I get the call.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.190
But my salary is based
on whether I'm on call

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.200
all the time or not at all.

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.280
And I get to choose that.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.940
Somehow that's the
flexibility in the contract.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:13.590
And this is the decentralized
version with the household

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:14.460
optimization.

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.520
Firms maximize profits
and markets clear.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.173
That's where we're going to
get the wage, the overall wage

00:59:21.173 --> 00:59:22.090
and the interest rate.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.600
So if you looked at the
first order condition

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:33.230
to the consumer problem, you
would see some obvious things

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:34.610
happening.

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:40.490
You're going to have a
theta price, shadow price,

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.190
on the budget constraint
that I just showed you.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:48.300
And these probabilities
are entering symmetrically

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.842
in utility and in consumption.

00:59:50.842 --> 00:59:52.300
So when you take
a derivative, they

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.850
are kind of like cancel out.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.710
And so you get this.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:00.220
But, look, here, they're
going to cancel on both sides.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220
So theta is common.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.807
So consumption has to be common.

01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:07.140
So you're going to get full
insurance on the consumption

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.100
side.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.040
There's no reason to
let consumption vary.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.830
Remember, this was a
separable utility function.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.760
It was the utility
of consumption plus--

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.170
so why screw up the marginal
utility of consumption?

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.830
You can get full smoothing out
of on the consumption side.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.920
So consumption is equal to each
other, whether you work or not.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:40.780
But that theme may not
be at the boundary.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.980
It could be interior.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.430
So substituting a
common consumption,

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.170
remembering
disutility of work is

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:56.890
just m, you have this
new optimization problem.

01:00:56.890 --> 01:01:00.350
And this is equivalent
with the other one.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.360
Now, where's the
aggregate elasticity?

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.180
What's the disutility of work?

01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:14.563
AUDIENCE: Phi, right?

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:20.300
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It's linear.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:26.170
It doesn't get any more easy
to substitute than that.

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:30.470
See here it looks like
you're choosing phi.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:34.750
But the coefficient in front
of it is just a number, m.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:41.720
So phi is-- you know, why
is phi look like hours?

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.570
Phi is the fraction of
time you're working.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.810
And if you work,
you're working 1.

01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:51.980
So total hours is like the
fraction of the population

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.630
working.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:57.560
That varies continuously-- this
sort of pseudo representative

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.620
consumer thinks that it can
choose any fraction it wants,

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.520
even though the underlying
population cannot.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.390
This is a stand in household.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.640
It's not a real household.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.720
But the aggregates that
are predicted from this

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.460
will correspond to the
underlying problem.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.060
So that was the insight
that Rogerson had.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.240
And actually, I'm pretty
sure it's also 1 to 1

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.040
with the right welfare.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.700
You can use that
aggregated utility

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.370
as a representation of
the underlying welfare.

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:41.603
Why is that?

01:02:41.603 --> 01:02:43.520
Well, even though you
have all that diversity,

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.560
households are
really alike in terms

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.820
of their utility functions.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.460
So expected utility
is the right metric.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.020
And that's what that thing is.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.720
It just looks funny
when you write it down.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.220
OK.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.750
And then quickly, here's
Hansen's version of it

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:27.080
with business cycles, going
to the actual aggregate data.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:33.400
As I said, total
hours worked is hours

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.190
per person of
those participating

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:39.870
times the number participating.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:42.060
And then you take
logs of it, basically.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.350
And then you want to
look at a variance.

01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:47.310
You say the variance of
a log of aggregate hours

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:49.420
has three components.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.770
It's the variance of
individual hours, the variance

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.970
of participation on
the extensive margin

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.520
and this covariance term.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.420
And in the US data,
those are the numbers

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.690
consistent with that table
that I showed you before.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.780
So a lot of the
variability in hours,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.730
say over a business
cycle or something,

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.688
has to do with
varying participation

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:14.730
among individual members.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:28.810
OK, so this is sort of
familiar ingredients.

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:30.280
You'd have an
aggregate production

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.330
function over hours in capital.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:36.630
You have some Markov
process on TFP.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:43.050
You've seen this in the first
part of this class as well.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:44.370
Capital depreciates.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.740
You can add to it
with investment.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.430
And you've got this
utility function.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:54.510
Again, this is like a
Cobb-Douglas version, well,

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.610
logs off of a
Cobb-Douglas version.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:02.770
And the overall
problem is to maximize

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.600
discounted expected utility.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.410
Except we introduce
this indivisibility.

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.950
So you can either
work at h sub 0 hours

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:22.520
with some probability or 0.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:29.070
Just like Rogerson with
slightly different notation,

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:36.710
you'd get alpha T, say the
probability of working or not

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:38.460
working.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.660
You know, the way they've
normalized it, the log of 1

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:42.440
is 0.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.600
This thing is going to drop out.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.490
And you'll get a
utility function

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:50.795
over consumption and hours.

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:58.660
But remember, again,
just to reiterate,

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.770
h0 is the fixed number
of hours you have

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:05.490
to work if you work at all.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:08.430
And alpha t is the fraction
of the population that's

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.810
being assigned to work word.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:13.530
Alpha, this coefficient
in front of hours,

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.894
is the thing that's getting
determined in equilibrium.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.830
So after you make all
those substitutions,

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.260
just like we did before
with Rogerson's paper,

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.650
we end up with
this pseudo utility

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.010
for the representative consumer.

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:42.550
And, yeah, again,
it's linear in hours.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.860
So depending on the
wage relative to b,

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.570
it would look as if there's
just enormous willingness

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:54.820
to supply labor, or elasticity,
as you go from low wages

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:59.200
to high wages, you know,
an enormous response.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.240
It's just a review
of what Rogerson did,

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:08.910
but it's in the context of
this business cycle model.

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:12.210
So solve the first
order conditions.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.550
Compute the steady state.

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:18.210
Compute approximation
to the steady state.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.630
Solve for the law of motion
of the endogenous variables.

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:23.940
And compute the moments.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.240
Now, I don't want
to belabor this,

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.870
because it would just
take us too much time.

01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:35.640
But we did models at
the beginning of class

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.780
that featured occupation choice
and development and so on.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.300
This is like that
in the sense that we

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:46.215
have an attempt to match data.

01:07:46.215 --> 01:07:47.590
In this case, in
this literature,

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.300
it happens to be
business cycle data.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.260
But you're going to see Seema's
version of it in a moment.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.830
So the cool thing is
you've got this machine.

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.470
You've got this model.

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.690
And if you're willing to take
a stand on parameters that you

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.990
observe in data or
calibrate other parameters,

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.090
you can generate time
series from the model.

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:10.900
And you can compare
the time series

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.710
to what you see in the data.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:17.290
And this is the algorithm
for solving the model.

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:20.500
Again, I'm not going
to belabor this.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.819
You know, they pick capital
share and depreciation rates

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:38.470
and discount rates and so on and
so forth and generate the data.

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.689
Now, they're two economies here.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:44.470
This one with divisible
labor, this one

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:47.229
that we featured with
indivisible labor.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:53.330
And you might want to look
at the variability of output

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.710
consumption and hours.

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:57.080
This is the variability
of ours in the data.

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:05.109
This is the variability of hours
without the indivisibility.

01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:07.600
This is the variability
of hours with it.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.750
Now, they didn't get it
all the way up to 1.66.

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.479
But they're certainly
dominating 0.70.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:16.149
So that, you know,
as I keep saying,

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:19.029
these economies with certain
kinds of indivisibilities

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.939
are able to increase
the responsiveness

01:09:21.939 --> 01:09:26.944
of aggregate hours to wages,
more consistent with what

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:27.444
we see.

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.320
Yeah, Matt.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.069
AUDIENCE: Is this economy
with individual labor,

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:33.080
is it actually--

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.622
like one of your
student simulation--

01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:37.290
is it identical to the RBC model
except the utility function?

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.310
Well, except for the
indivisibility, yeah.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.340
AUDIENCE: When you have
the utility function with

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.125
indivisibility, when you
have like the reduced form,

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:50.750
because don't--

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:55.712
I mean, in fact, again you've
got phi or the proportion

01:09:55.712 --> 01:09:59.603
of time work--

01:09:59.603 --> 01:10:01.270
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
That's what's going on.

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.020
See, there are two
economies here and kind

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.450
of two ways of doing business.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.990
You could go to the micro
data, look at individual labor

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:11.080
supply, try to
populate the economy

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.650
with some fresh elasticity
that you observe in the data

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:17.290
and then go through
all the steps.

01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.720
Or you could say,
no, no, no, no,

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.460
you either work
or you don't work,

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:26.230
get that pseudo household.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:31.350
And it's going to generate
its own elasticity

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.660
and redo the simulations.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.885
And that's what's
getting compared here.

01:10:36.885 --> 01:10:37.795
Yep.

01:10:37.795 --> 01:10:41.380
AUDIENCE: Compared to the
response of working hours

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.020
is totally driven by
the extensive margin.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.090
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.800
AUDIENCE: If you
also want to match

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.320
the elasticity of this
extensive margin, maybe--

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.010
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes, I'll
show you another paper where--

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:58.330
so this is too extreme.

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:01.780
But it shows how to get--

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:06.600
OK, so this is Kim.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.250
I'll take you through
this really quickly.

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:12.750
But it does link up to the
incomplete market literature

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:15.180
that we talked about last time.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.340
And the point is you
can generate a higher

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.610
aggregate elasticity than
what you see in the data

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:26.690
without assuming all this
stuff with complete markets

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:28.650
and the lotteries.

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.480
So in other words,
there's something

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.420
crucial about the aggregation,
which is more limited here.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.420
We're not going to
get as high a number.

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:43.920
But we are going to get a higher
aggregate elasticity than what

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.750
you would think if
you just looked,

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:48.330
as Yeng was saying
really, if you just

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.180
looked at the micro data.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.950
This is a nice paper--

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.220
I wasn't aware of it till
a few months ago actually--

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.380
because they're really
into the details

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.960
of the cross-sectional earnings
and wealth distribution.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.050
They're really looking
at the micro data.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:07.760
Whereas those macro
guys, at most,

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.410
are borrowing a few parameters.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:19.770
You've got males and females,
like a two-member household,

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:22.920
maximizing expected
discounted utility.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.400
This is again this Cobb-Douglass
type specification.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.950
This is at the
aggregate household

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:35.180
level for some reason already
aggregated with these weights.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.470
So it's male hours
and female hours.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.200
Gamma is the sort of degree of
inter-temporal sub-elasticity

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.660
that we care so much about.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:53.357
And now, they're going
to be serious micro guys,

01:12:53.357 --> 01:12:55.315
and they're going to
actually look in the data,

01:12:55.315 --> 01:13:00.640
at male and female wages
and impute productivity.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.340
So these x things--

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.730
there's going to be one for
males and one for females--

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:10.360
take hours and multiply
by productivities.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.630
And these productivities
can move around over time.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:17.440
So it's not just a firm having
TFP that's moving around.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.380
It's households having
labor productivity

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.300
that's moving around.

01:13:25.173 --> 01:13:26.590
And the household
is going to have

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:30.630
this sort of standard incomplete
markets budget constraints.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:34.720
So this looks a lot like what
we had last time sort of.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.970
They're going to have assets
in the previous period

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.440
and interest on that.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.490
They can save to take
into the following period.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.770
And the household,
as a whole, is

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:48.130
going to have wage earnings
as a function of hours.

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:49.480
Now, we have labor supply.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.590
We didn't have
that last Tuesday.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:56.140
And there's, say,
a bound on assets.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.810
This could be
zero, no borrowing.

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:02.170
It could be a negative
number, a limit on borrowing.

01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:06.100
Just like the standard
incomplete markets lecture

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.580
from last time, we give them
an aggregate Cobb-Douglas

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.780
technology.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.535
And we solve this
forward-looking value function.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.420
So it's a bit bewildering.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.780
But they're both working.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.180
This e is not we.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.290
It's like wee.

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:33.100
No, ee means employed
employed, employed not

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:37.810
employed, et cetera, depending
on the female and male members.

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.810
And this is the case
where currently they're

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.660
both employed.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.020
Solving for assets,
you know, anticipating

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.530
that they'll decide on
their work status next time.

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:54.850
Now, again, you can see
this extensive margin here

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:59.050
is playing a big role,
deciding member by member

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.280
whether it will
be working or not.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.700
And at least in the '50s,
this was a big issue,

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:10.030
increasing female labor
force participation.

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.740
Things have settled down now.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.060
It's much more symmetric.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.200
But the wife did not
always stay home.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.140
Sometimes they
participated, depending

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.560
on the household situation.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:30.600
So family labor supply, and
what do I want to say here?

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.270
So not much.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:37.840
It looks more
complicated than it is.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:45.320
You have this all for a steady
state, which is complicated.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.310
Someone asked me-- who was it?

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:51.433
Can't remember-- about
adding state variables.

01:15:51.433 --> 01:15:53.600
So here, you know, we have
a lot of state variables.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.140
We've got male productivity.

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.930
We've got female productivity.

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:59.000
We have the
distribution of wealth.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.500
All these things
have distributions

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.190
in the population.

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.890
And we have the sort of shock
in the aggregate production

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:07.390
function.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.060
So they're going to do
what those macro guys do,

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.020
which is just look
in the steady state.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.080
They have to compute it.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.420
And then they're going
to look at very--

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.390
there's no time subscripts on
the wages and interest rates,

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:25.730
because you're in a
steady state, where

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:28.790
all this distribution
stuff has settled down.

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:31.970
You have a lot of
churning from one status

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:35.060
to another within
the steady state.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.760
So individuals and
households are experiencing

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.670
different things over time.

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:44.300
But the economy wide
wages and interest rates

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.980
have settled down to constants.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:55.370
And I'll skip-- they actually
start estimating parameters

01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:57.500
with the micro data.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:05.930
And, you know,
their goal here is

01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:09.830
to get this aggregate
elasticity high,

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:13.100
higher than you
would see as they

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.900
estimate from the micro data.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.320
So, Yeng, that's a
little better example

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.890
of actually looking at
the underlying micro data

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:26.940
and still using this sort
of macro aggregation.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.670
Yep?

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:32.170
AUDIENCE: Still saying
that from micro data

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:36.243
the elasticity, so it's
made to be smaller.

01:17:36.243 --> 01:17:37.160
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.290
Yeah.

01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:40.550
AUDIENCE: Like even though
you have model, it just--

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:41.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.180
So why is it still happening?

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.100
Because, again, there's
this indivisibility

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.164
going on about whether
or not to work.

01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:55.440
AUDIENCE: So if you incorporate
indivisibility, then--

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.830
because I thought
that point of Cheng

01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:03.180
is that if you look at
the extensive margin,

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.130
that's still like
very small compared

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:09.964
to what the macro model
would be in individual labor.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.550
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, again,
at the individual level,

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:18.867
you'll back out certain
low elasticities.

01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:20.450
But the point of
this whole literature

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.540
is when you
aggregate up and look

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:27.230
at how aggregated hours
are moving around,

01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:28.910
you can get bigger numbers.

01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.370
It's not inconsistent.

01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:38.790
Which brings me very briefly,
although fortunately, I've

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:44.560
said a few words about
this, Seema's paper

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.460
looks at productivity shots in
agriculture And, looks at what

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:50.405
happens to wages.

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.100
Now, you know, think
about a supply curve

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.390
and a varying demand curve.

01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:01.350
So it rains a lot or
a little, that kind

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.150
of affects productivity.

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:05.880
That's moving the
demand for labor.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.760
If the supply
curve is inelastic,

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.970
you're going to get a high
variability in the wage.

01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:13.470
Her point is she cares.

01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:17.370
The workers get hurt a lot
when there are droughts

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:20.160
and it doesn't rain
because the wage drops.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.530
Landowners love it.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:27.510
Their output is lower, but
they have less of a wage bill.

01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:32.430
And then she couples that with
assumptions about how well

01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:36.990
or how poorly the
banking system is.

01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:40.950
So I'll just tell
you in words, she

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:45.650
has a 2-period problem, which
she thinks is enough, rightly,

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:47.870
to get what she wants.

01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:49.530
She has people forward looking.

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:52.100
So they're solving
2-period problems.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.220
And then you decide
whether or not to save

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.330
or to borrow based on
your current situation.

01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:03.590
She's saying that if
they can borrow and save

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:05.630
in the banking system
is good, they're

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:13.430
going to be less needing to
work in a bad agricultural year,

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:16.970
because they can borrow
instead of working harder.

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:19.730
So this is an
incomplete markets model

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:25.310
with limitations and regional
variation in the banking system

01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:30.080
that is focused on how
much wages move around

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.795
with productivity agricultural
productivity shocks.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.160
Now, her paper is qualitative
in the sense that she shows that

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.370
there is with less what she
called wage elasticity--

01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:47.670
there's less responsiveness
of wage to rainfall shocks

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:50.930
or instrumented
productivity shocks--

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:52.520
the better the
banking system is.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.360
That's what she cares about.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.650
Now, interestingly, she
doesn't get into the details

01:20:57.650 --> 01:20:59.700
of the numbers.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.970
How quantitatively big or
small is this response?

01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:05.580
So she doesn't do
anything wrong.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.860
It's actually a very nice paper.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:12.630
But if she were seriously trying
to estimate the elasticities,

01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:15.630
she would need to
take into account

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:19.410
whether there is this
extensive margin participation.

01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:21.450
And the aggregate
level elasticities

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:28.560
could be lower than they might
seem to be as in the two papers

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.450
that we just covered.

01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:33.060
So again, nothing wrong.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.970
But, you know, when you're in
practice and development work

01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:38.340
and you're thinking not just
about individual responses,

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.340
but sort of collective
responses and whole regions,

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.970
and so on then these sort
of tricks that we get,

01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:49.930
lessons learned from
the macro literature

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:53.080
are very helpful in combining
the macro and micro data.

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:59.380
So you can read the
details of the slides.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.460
But I basically covered it.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.340
Thank you.

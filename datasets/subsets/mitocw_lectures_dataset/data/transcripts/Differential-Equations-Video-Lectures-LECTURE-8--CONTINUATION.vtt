00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I usually like to start a
lecture with something new,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but this time I'm going to make
an exception,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and start with the finishing up
on Friday because it involves a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
little more practice with
complex numbers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I think that's what a large
number of you are still fairly

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
weak in.
So, to briefly remind you,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it will be sort of
self-contained,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but still, it will use complex
numbers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And, I think it's a good way to
start today.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, remember,
the basic problem was to solve

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
something with,
where the input was sinusoidal

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in particular.
The k was on both sides,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the input looked like
cosine omega t.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And, the plan of the solution
consisted of transporting the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
problem to the complex domain.
So, you look for a complex

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
solution, and you complexify the
right hand side of the equation,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as well.
So, cosine omega t

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
becomes the real part of
this complex function.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The reason for doing that,
remember, was because it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
easier to handle when you solve
linear equations.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's much easier to handle
exponentials on the right-hand

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
side than it is to handle sines
and cosines because exponentials

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
are so easy to integrate when
you multiply them by other

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
exponentials.
So, the result was,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
after doing that,
y tilda turned out to be one,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
after I scale the coefficient,
one over one plus omega over k

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then, the rest was e to the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
i times (omega t minus phi),

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
where phi had a certain
meaning.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was the arc tangent of a,
it was a phase lag.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And, this was then,
I had to take the real part of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
this to get the final answer,
which came out to be something

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
like one over the square root of
one plus the amplitude one omega

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
/ k squared, and then the rest
was cosine omega t plus minus

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
phi.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's easier to see that that
part is the real part of this;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the problem is,
of course you have to convert

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
this.
Sorry, this should be i omega

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
t, in which case you don't need
the parentheses,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
either.
So, the problem was to use the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
polar representation of this
complex number to convert it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
into something whose amplitude
was this, and whose angle was

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
minus phi.
Now, that's what we call the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
polar method,
going polar.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'd like, now,
for the first few minutes of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the period, to talk about the
other method,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the Cartesian method.
I think for a long while,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
many of you will be more
comfortable with that anyway.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Although, one of the objects of
the course should be to get you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
equally comfortable with the
polar representation of complex

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
numbers.
So, if we try to do the same

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
thing going Cartesian,
what's going to happen?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Well, I guess the same point
here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, the starting point is still
y tilde equals one over,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
sorry, this should have an i
here, one plus i times omega

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
over k, e to the i omega t.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But now, what you're going to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
do is turn this into its
Cartesian, turn both of these

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
into their Cartesian
representations as a plus ib.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So, if you do that Cartesianly,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of course, what you have to do
is the standard thing about

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
dividing complex numbers or
taking the reciprocals that I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
told you at the very beginning
of complex numbers.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You multiply the top and bottom
by the complex conjugate of this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in order to make the bottom
real.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So, what does this become?
This becomes one minus i times

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
omega over k divided by the
product of this in its complex

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
conjugate, which is the real
number, one plus omega over k

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
squared

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So, I've now converted this to
the a plus bi form.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I have also to convert the
right-hand side to the a plus bi

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
form.
So, it will look like cosine

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
omega t plus i sine omega t.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Having done that,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I take the last step,
which is to take the real part

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of that.
Remember, the reason I want the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
real part is because this input
was the real part of the complex

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
input.
So, once you've got the complex

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
solution, you have to take its
real part to go back into the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
domain you started with,
of real numbers,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
from the domain of complex
numbers.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So, I want the real part is
going to be, the real part of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that is, first of all,
there's a factor out in front.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's entirely real.
Let's put that out in front,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
so doesn't bother us
particularly.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And now, I need the product of
this complex number and that

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
complex number.
But, I only want the real part

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of it.
So, I'm not going to multiply

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it out and get four terms.
I'm just going to look at the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
two terms that I do want.
I don't want the others.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
All right, the real part is
cosine omega t,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
from the product of this and
that.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And, the rest of the real part
will be the product of the two i

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
terms.
But, it's i times negative i,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which makes one.
And therefore,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
it's omega over k times sine
omega t.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, that's the answer.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And that's the answer,
too; they must be equal,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
unless there's a contradiction
in mathematics.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
But, it's extremely important.
And that's the other reason why

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'm giving you this,
that you learn in this course

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to be able to convert quickly
and automatically things that

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
look like this into things that
look like that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And, that's done by means of a
basic formula,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
which occurs at the end of the
notes for reference,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
as I optimistically say,
although I think for a lot of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
you will not be referenced,
stuff in the category of,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
yeah, I think I've vaguely seen
that somewhere.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But, well, we never used it for
anything.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Okay, you're going to use it
all term.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, the formula is,
the famous trigonometric

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
identity, which is,
so, the problem is to convert

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
this into the other guy.
And, the thing which is going

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to do that, enable one to
combine the sine and the cosine

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
terms, is the famous formula
that a times the cosine,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I'm going to use theta to make
it as neutral as possible,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
--
-- so, theta you can think of

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
as being replaced by omega t in
this particular application of

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the formula.
But, I'll just use a general

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
angle theta, which doesn't
suggest anything in particular.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, the problem is,
you have something which is a

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
combination with real
coefficients of cosine and sine,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and the important thing is that
these numbers be the same.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
In practice,
that means that the omega t,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
you're not allowed to have
omega one t here,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and some other frequency,
omega two t here.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
That would correspond to using
theta one here,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and theta two here.
And, though there is a formula

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
for combining that,
nobody remembers it,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and it's, in general,
less universally useful than

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the first.
If you're going to memorize a

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
formula, and learn this one,
it's best to start with the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
ones where the two are equal.
That's the basic formula.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The others are variations of
it, but there is a sizable

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
variations.
All right, so the answer is

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that this is equal to some other
constant, real constant,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
times the cosine of theta minus
phi.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Of course, most people remember
this vaguely.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
What they don't remember is
what the c and the phi are,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
how to calculate them.
I don't suggest you memorize

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the formulas for them.
You can if you wish.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Instead, memorize the picture,
which is much easier.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Memorize that a and b are the
two sides of a right triangle.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Phi is the angle opposite the b
side, and c is the length of the

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
hypotenuse.
Okay, that's worth putting up.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I think that's a pink formula.
It's even worth two of those,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but I will thrift.
Now, let's apply it to this

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
case to see that it gives the
right answer.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So, to use this formula,
how I use it?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Well, I should take,
I will reproduce the left-hand

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
side.
So that part,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I just copy.
And, how about the right?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Well, the amplitude,
it's combined into a single

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
cosine term whose amplitude is,
well, the two sides of the

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
right triangle are one,
and omega over k.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
The hypotenuse in that case is
going to be, well,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
why don't we write it here?
So, we have one,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and omega over k.
And, here's phi.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So, the hypotenuse is going to
be the square root of one plus

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
omega over k squared.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And, that's going to be
multiplied by the cosine of

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
omega t minus this phase lag
angle phi.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
You can write,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
if you wish,
phi equals the arc tangent,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
but you are not learning a lot
by that.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Phi is the arc tangent of omega
over k.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
That's okay,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
but it's true.
But, notice there's

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
cancellation now.
This over that is equal to

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
what?
Well, it's equal to this.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And, so when we get in this
way, by combining these two

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
factors, one gets exactly the
same formula that we got before.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So, as you can see,
in some sense,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
there's not,
if you can remember this

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
trigonometric identity,
there's not a lot of difference

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
between the two methods except
that this one requires this

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
extra step.
The answer will come out in

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
this form, and you then,
to see what it really looks

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
like, really have to convert it
to this form,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
the form in which you can see
what the phase lag and the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
amplitude is.
It's amazing how many people

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
who should know,
this includes working

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
mathematicians,
theoretical mathematicians,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
includes even possibly the
authors of your textbooks.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I'm not sure,
but I've caught them in this,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
too, who in this form,
everybody remembers that it's

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
something like that.
Unfortunately,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
when it occurs as the answer in
an answer book,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the numbers are some colossal
mess here plus some colossal

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
mess here.
And theta is,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
again, a real mess,
involving roots and some cube

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
roots, and whatnot.
The only thing is,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
these two are the same real
mess.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That amounts to just another
pure oscillation with the same

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
frequency as the old guy,
and with the amplitude changed,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and with a phase shift,
move to the right or left.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So, this is no more general
than that.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Notice they both have two
parameters in them,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
these two coefficients.
This one has the two parameters

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
in an altered form.
Okay, well, I wanted,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
because of the importance of
this formula,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I wanted to take a couple of
minutes out for a proof of the

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
formula, --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
-- just to give you chance to
stare at it a little more now.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
There are three proofs I know.
I'm sure there are 27.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The Pythagorean theorem now has
several hundred.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But, there are three basic
proofs.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
There is the one I will not
give you, I'll call the high

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
school proof,
which is the only one one

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
normally finds in books,
physics textbooks or other

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
textbooks.
The high school proof takes the

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
right-hand side,
applies the formula for the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
cosine of the difference of two
angles, which it assumes you had

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
in trigonometry,
and then converts it into this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It shows you that once you've
done that, that a turns out to

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
be c cosine phi
and b, the number b is c sine

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
phi,
and therefore it identifies the

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
two sides.
Now, the thing that's of course

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
correct and it's the simplest
possible argument,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
the thing that's no good about
it is that the direction at

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
which it goes is from here to
here.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Well, everybody knew that.
If I gave you this and told

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
you, write it out in terms of
cosine and sine,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I would assume it dearly hope
that practically all of you can

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
do that.
Unfortunately,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
when you want to use the
formula, it's this way you want

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to use it in the opposite
direction.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You are starting with this,
and want to convert it to that.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Now, the proof,
therefore, will not be of much

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
help.
It requires you to go in the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
backwards direction,
and match up coefficients.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It's much better to go
forwards.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Now, there are two proofs that
go forwards.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
There's the 18.02 proof.
Since I didn't teach most of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
you 18.02, I can't be sure you
had it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So, I'll spend one minute
giving it to you.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
What is the 18.02 proof?
It is the following picture.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I think this requires deep
colored chalk.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is going to be pretty
heavy.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
All right, first of all,
the a and the b are the given.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So, I'm going to put in that
vector.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So, there is the vector whose
sides are, whose components are

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
a and b.
I'll write it without the i and

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
j.
I hope you had from Jerison

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
that form for the vector,
if you don't like that,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
write ai plus bj,
okay?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Now, there's another vector
lurking around.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It's the unit vector whose,
I'll write it this way,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
u because it's a unit vector,
and theta to indicate that it's

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
angle is theta.
Now, the reason for doing that

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
is because you see that the
left-hand side is a dot product

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
of two vectors.
The left-hand side of the

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
identity is the dot product of
the vector <a,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
b> with the vector whose
components are cosine theta and

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
sine theta.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
That's what I'm calling this
unit vector.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
It's a unit vector because
cosine squared plus sine squared

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
is one.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Now, all this formula is,
is saying that scalar product,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the dot product of those two
vectors, can be evaluated if you

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
know their components by the
left-hand side of the formula.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And, if you don't know their
components, it can be evaluated

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
in another way,
the geometric evaluation,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
which goes, what is it?
It's a magnitude of one,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
times the magnitude of the
other, times the cosine of the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
included angle.
Now, what's the included angle?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Well, theta is this angle from
the horizontal to that unit

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
vector.
The angle phi is this angle,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
from this picture here.
And therefore,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
the included angle between
(u)theta and my pink vector is

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
theta minus phi.
That's the formula.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It comes from two ways of
calculating the scalar product

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
of the vector whose coefficients
are, and the unit vector

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
whose components are cosine
theta and sine theta.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
All right, well,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
you should, that was 18.02.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
There must be an 18.03 proof
also. Yes.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
What's the 18.03 proof?
The 18.03 proof uses complex

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
numbers.
It says, look,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
take the left side.
Instead of viewing it as the

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
dot product of two vectors,
there's another way.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You can think of it as the part
of the products of two complex

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
numbers.
So, the 18.03 argument,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
really, the complex number
argument says,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
look, multiply together a minus
bi and the complex

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
number cosine theta plus i sine
theta.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
There are different ways of

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
explaining why I want to put the
minus i there instead of i.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But, the simplest is because I
want, when I take the real part,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
to get the left-hand side.
I will.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
If I take the real part of
this, I'm going to get a cosine

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
theta plus b sine theta

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
because of negative i and i make
one,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
multiplied together.
All right, that's the left-hand

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
side.
And now, the right-hand side,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I'm going to use polar
representation instead.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
What's the polar representation
of this guy?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Well, if <a,
b> has the angle theta,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
then a negative b,
a minus bi goes down

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
below.
It has the angle minus phi.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So, this is,
has magnitude.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
It is polar representation.
Its magnitude is a squared plus

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
b squared,
and its angle is negative phi,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
not positive phi because this a
minus bi goes below

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
the axis if a and b are
positive.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
So, it's e to the minus i phi.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
That's the first guy.
And, how about the second guy?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Well, the second guy is e to
the i theta.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So, what's the product?
It is a squared plus b squared,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
the square root,
times e to the i times (theta

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
minus phi).

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And now, what do I want?
The real part of this,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and I want the real part of
this.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So, let's just say take the
real parts of both sides.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
If I take the real part of the
left-hand side,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I get a cosine theta plus b
sine theta.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
If I take a real part of this

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
side, I get square root of a
squared plus b squared times e,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
times the cosine,
that's the real part,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
right, of theta minus phi,
which is just what it's

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
supposed to be.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Well, with three different
arguments, I'm really pounding

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
the table on this formula.
But, I think there's something

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
to be learned from at least two
of them.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And, you know,
I'm still, for awhile,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I will never miss an
opportunity to bang complex

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
numbers into your head because,
in some sense,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
you have to reproduce the
experience of the race.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
As I mentioned in the notes,
it took mathematicians 300 or

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
400 years to get used to complex
numbers.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So, if it takes you three or
four weeks, that's not too bad.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Now, for the rest of the period
I'd like to go back to the

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
linear equations,
and try to put into perspective

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
and summarize,
and tell you a couple of things

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
which I had to leave out,
but which are,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
in my view, extremely
important.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And, up to now,
I don't want to leave you with

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
any misapprehensions.
So, I'm going to summarize this

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
way, whereas last lecture I went
from the most general equation

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
to the most special.
I'd like to just write them

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
down in the reverse order,
now.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So, we are talking about basic
linear equations.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
First order,
of course, we haven't moved as

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
a second order yet.
So, the most special one,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
and the one we talked about
essentially all of the previous

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
two times, or last Friday,
anyway, was the equation where

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
the k, the coefficient of y,
is constant,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
and where you also get it on
the right-hand side quite

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
providentially.
So, this is the most special

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
form, and it's the one which
governed what I will call the

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
temperature-concentration model,
or if you want to be grown up,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
the conduction-diffusion model,
conduction-diffusion which

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
describes the processes,
which the equation is modeling,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
whereas these simply described
the variables of things,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
which you usually are trying to
calculate when you use the

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
equation.
Now, there are a class of

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
things where the thing is
constant, but where the k does

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
not appear naturally on the
right hand side.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And, you're going to encounter
them pretty quickly in physics,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
for one place.
So, I better not try to sweep

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
those under the rug.
Let's just call that q of t.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And finally,
there is the most general case,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
where you allow k to be
non-constant.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
That's the one we began,
when we talked about the linear

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
equation.
And you know how to solve it in

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
general by a definite or an
indefinite integral.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Now, there's one other thing,
which I want to talk about.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I will do all these in a
certain order.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
But, from the beginning,
you should keep in mind that

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
there's another between the
first two cases.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Between the first two cases,
there's another extremely

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
important distinction,
and that is as to whether k is

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
positive or not.
Up to now, we've always had k

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
positive.
So, I'm going to put that here.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So, it's understood when I
write these, that k is positive.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I want to talk about that,
too.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
But, first things first.
The first thing I wanted to do

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
was to show you that this,
the first case,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
the most special case,
does not just apply to this.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
It applies to other things,
too.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Let me give you a mixing
problem.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
The typical mixing problem
gives another example.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
You've already done in
recitation, and you did one for

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
the problem set,
the problem of the two rooms

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
filled with smoke.
But, let me do it just using

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
letters, so that the ideas stand
out a little more clearly,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
and you are not preoccupied
with the numbers,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
and calculating with the
numbers, and trying to get

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
numerical examples.
So, it's as simple as k sub

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
mixing.
It looks like this.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
You have a tank,
a room, I don't know,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
where everything's getting
mixed in.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
It has a certain volume,
which I will call v.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Something is flowing in,
a gas or a liquid.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And, r will be the flow rate,
in some units.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Now, since it can't pile up
inside this sealed container,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
which I'm sure is full,
the flow rate out must also be

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
r.
And, what we're interested in

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
is the amount of salt.
So, x, let's suppose these are

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
fluid flows, and the dissolved
substance that I'm talking about

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
is not carbon monoxide,
it's salt, any dissolved

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
substance, some pollutant or
whatever the problem calls for.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Let's use salt.
So, it's the amount of salt in

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
the tank at time t.
I'm interested in knowing how

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
that varies with time.
Now, there's nothing to be said

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
about how it flows out.
What flows out,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
of course, is what happens to
be in the tank.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
But, I do have to say what
flows in.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Now, the only convenient way to
describe the in-flow is in terms

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
of its concentration.
The salt will be dissolved in

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
the in-flowing water,
and so there will be a certain

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
concentration.
And, as you will see,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
for a secret reason,
I'm going to give that the

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
subscript e.
So, e is the concentration of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
the incoming salt,
in other words,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
in the fluid,
how many grams are there per

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
liter in the incoming fluid.
That's the data.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So, this is the data.
r is part of the data.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
r is the flow rate.
v is the volume.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
I think I won't bother writing
that down, and the problem is to

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
determine what happens to x of
t.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Now, I strongly recommend you
not attempt to work directly

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
with the concentrations unless
you feel you have a really good

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
physical feeling for
concentrations.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
I strongly recommend you work
with a variable that you are

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
given, namely,
the dependent variable,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
which is the amount of salt,
grams.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Well, because it's something
you can physically think about.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
It's coming in,
it's getting mixed up,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
and some of it is going out.
So, the basic equation is going

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
to be that the rate of change of
salt in the tank is the rate of

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
salt inflow, let me write salt
inflow, minus the rate of salt

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
outflow.
Okay, at what rate is salt

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
flowing in?
Well, the flow rate is the flow

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
rate of the liquid.
I multiply the flow rate,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
1 L per minute times the
concentration,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
3 g per liter.
That means 3 g per minute.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
It's going to be,
therefore, the product of the

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
flow rate and the concentration,
incoming concentration.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
How about the rate of the salt
outflow?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Well, again,
the rate of the liquid outflow

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
is r.
And, what is the concentration

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
of salt in the outflow?
I must use, when you talk flow

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
rates, the other factor must be
the concentration,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
not the amount.
So, what is the concentration

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
in the outflow?
Well, it's the amount of salt

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
in the tank divided by its
volume.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So, the analog,
the concentration here is x

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
divided by v.
Now, here's a typical messy

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
equation, dx / dt,
let's write it in the standard,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
linear form,
plus r times x over v equals r

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
times the given concentration,
which is a function of time.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Now, this is going to be some
given function,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
and there will be no reason
whatsoever why you can't solve

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
it in that form.
And, that's normally what you

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
will do.
Nonetheless,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
in trying to understand how it
fits into this paradigm,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
which kind of equation is it?
Well, clearly there's an

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
awkwardness in that on the
right-hand side,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
we have concentration,
and on the left-hand side,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
we seem to have amounts.
Now, the way to understand the

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
equation as opposed to the way
to solve it, well,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
it's a step on the way to
solving it.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
But, I emphasize,
you can and normally will solve

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
it in exactly that form.
But, to understand what's

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
happening, it's better to
express it in terms of

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
concentration entirely,
and that's why it's called the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
concentration,
or the diffusion,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
concentration-diffusion
equation.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
So, I'm going to convert this
to concentrations.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Now, there's no problem here.
x over v is the concentration

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
in the tank.
And now, immediately,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
you see, hey,
it looks like it's going to

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
come out just in the first form.
But, wait a minute.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
How about the x?
How do I convert that?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Well, what's the relation
between x?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
So, if the concentration in the
tank is equal to x over v,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
so the tank concentration,
then x is equal to C times the

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
constant, V, and dx / dt,
therefore, will be c times dC /

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
dt.
You see that?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Now, that's not in standard
form.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Let's put it in standard form.
To put it in standard form,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
I see, now, that it's not r
that's the critical quantity.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
It's r divided by v.
So, it's dC / dt,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
C prime, plus r divided by v,
--

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
-- I'm going to call that k,
k C, no let's not,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
r divided by v is equal to r
divided by v times Ce.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
That's the equation expressed

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
in a form where the
concentration is the dependent

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
variable, rather than the amount
of salt itself.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And, you can see it falls
exactly in this category.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
That means that I can talk
about it.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
The natural way to talk about
this equation is in terms of,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
the same way we talked about
the temperature equation.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000
I said concentration.
I mean, that concentration has

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
nothing to do with this
concentration.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
This is the diffusion model,
where salt solution outside,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
cell in the middle,
salt diffusing through a

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
semi-permeable membrane into
that, uses Newton's law of

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
diffusion, except he didn't do a
law of diffusion.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
But, he is sticky.
His name is attached to

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
everything.
So, that's this concentration

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
model.
It's the one entirely analogous

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
to the temperature.
And the physical setup is the

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
same.
This one is entirely different.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Mixing in this form of this
problem has really nothing to do

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
with this model whatsoever.
But, nor does that

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
concentration had anything to do
with this concentration,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
which refers to the result of
the mixing in the tank.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
But, what happens is the
differential equation is the

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
same.
The language of input and

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
response that we talked about is
also available here.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
So, everything is the same.
And, the most interesting thing

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
is that it shows that the analog
of the conductivity,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
the k, the analog of
conductivity and diffusivity is

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
this quantity.
I should not be considering r

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
and v by themselves.
I should be considering as the

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
basic quantity,
the ratio of those two.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Now, why is that,
is the basic parameter.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
What is this?
Well, r is the rate of outflow,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
and the rate of inflow,
what's r over v?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
r over v is the fractional rate
of outflow.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
In other words,
if r over v is one tenth,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
it means that 1/10 of the tank
will be emptied in a minute,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
say.
In other words,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
we lumped these two constants
into a single k,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
and at the same time have
simplified the units.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
What are the units?
This is volume per minute.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
This is volume.
So, it's simply reciprocal

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
minutes, reciprocal time,
which was the same units of

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
that diffusivity and
conductivity had,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
reciprocal time.
The space variables have

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
entirely disappeared.
So, it that way,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
it's simplified.
It's simplified conceptually,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
and now, you can answer the
same type of questions we asked

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
before about this.
I think it would be better for

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
us to move on,
though.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Well, just an example,
one really simple thing,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
so, suppose since we spent so
much time worrying about what

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
was happening with sinusoid
inputs, I mean,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
when could Ce be sinusoidal,
for example?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Well, roughly sinusoidal if,
for example,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
some factory were polluting.
If this were a lake,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
and some factory were polluting
it, but in the beginning,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
at the beginning of the day,
they produced a lot of the

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
pollutant, and by the end of the
day when it wound down,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
it might well happen that the
concentration of pollutants in

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
the incoming stream would vary
sinusoidally with a 24 hour

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
cycle.
And then, we would be asking,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
so, suppose this varies
sinusoidally.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
In other words,
it's like cosine omega t.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I'm asking, how closely does

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
the concentration in the tank
follow C sub e?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Now, what would that depend
upon?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Think about it.
Well, the answer,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
suppose k is large.
Closely, let's just analyze one

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
case, if k is big.
Now, what would make k big?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
We know that from the
temperature thing.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
If the conductivity is high,
then the inner temperature will

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
follow the outer temperature
closely, and the same thing with

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
the diffusion model.
But we, of course,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
therefore, since the equation
is the same, we must get the

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
same result here.
Now, what would make k big?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
If r is big,
if the flow rate is very fast,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
we will expect the
concentration of the inside of

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
that tank to match fairly
closely the concentration of the

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
pollutant, of the incoming salt
solution, or,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
if the tank is very small.
For fixed flow rates,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
if the tank is very small,
well, then it gets emptied

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
quickly.
So, both of these are,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I think, intuitive results.
And, of course,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
as before, we got them from
that, by trying to analyze the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
final form of the solution.
In other words,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
we got them by looking at that
form of the solution up there,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
and seeing if k is big.
As k increases,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
what happens to the amplitude,
and what happens to the phase

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
lag?
But, that summarizes the two.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So, this means,
closely means,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
that the phase lag is,
big or small?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
The lag is small.
And, the amplitude is,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
well, the amplitude,
the biggest the amplitude could

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
ever be is one because that's
the amplitude of this.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
So, the amplitude is near one,
one because that's the

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
amplitude of the incoming
signal, input,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
whatever you want to call it.
Okay, now, I'd like to spend

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
the rest of the time talking
about the failures of number

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
one, and when you have to use
number two, and when even number

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
two is no good.
So, let me end first-order

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
equations by putting my worst
foot forward.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Well, I'm just trying to avoid
disappointment at

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
misapprehensions from you.
I'll watch you leave this room

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
and say, well,
he said that,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
okay.
So, the first one you're going

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
to encounter very shortly where
one is not satisfied,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
but two is, so on some examples
where you need two,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
well, it's going to happen
right here.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Somebody, sooner or later,
it's going to draw on that

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
loathsome orange chalk,
which is unerasable,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
something which looks like
that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Remember, you saw it here
first.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
r, yeah, we had that.
Okay, see, I had it in high

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
school too.
That's the capacitance.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
This is the resistance.
That's the electromotive force:

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000
battery, or a source of
alternating current,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
something like that.
Now, of course,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
what you're interested in is
how the current flows in the

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
circuit.
Since current across the

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
capacitance doesn't make sense,
you have to talk about the

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
charge on the capacitance.
So, q, it's customary in a

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
circle this simple to use as the
variable not current,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
but the charge on the
capacitance.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
And then Kirchhoff's,
you are also supposed to know

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
that the derivative,
that the time derivative of q

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
is what's called the current in
the circuit.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
That sort of intuitive.
But, i in a physics class,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
j in an electrical engineering
class, and why,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
not the letter Y,
but why is that?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
That's because of electrical
engineers use lots of lots of

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
complex numbers and therefore,
you have to call current j,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I guess.
I think they do j in physics,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
too, now.
No, no they don't.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
I don't know.
So, i is ambiguous if you are

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
in that particular subject.
And it's customary to use,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I don't know.
Now it's completely safe.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Okay, where are we?
Well, the law is,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the basic differential equation
is Kirchhoff's voltage law,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
but the sum of the voltage
drops across these three has to

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
be zero.
So, it's R times i,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
which is dq / dt.
That's Ohm's law.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
That's the voltage drop across
resistance.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
The voltage drop across the
capacitance is Coulomb's law,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
one form of Coulomb's law.
It's q divided by C.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
And, that has to be the voltage
drop.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And then, there is some sign
convention.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
So, this is either plus or
minus, depending on your sign

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
conventions, but it's E of t.
Now, if I put that in standard

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
form, in standard form I
probably should say q prime plus

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
q over RC equals,
well, I suppose,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
E over R.
And, this is what would appear

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
in the equation.
But, it's not the natural

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
thing.
The k is one over RC.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And, that's the reciprocal.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
The RC constant is what
everybody knows is important

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
when you talk about a little
circuit of that form.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
On the other hand,
the right-hand side,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
it's quite unnatural to try to
stick in the right-hand side

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000
that same RC.
Call this EC over RC.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000
People don't do that,
and therefore,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
it doesn't really fall into the
paradigm of that first equation.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
It's the second equation that
really falls into the category.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Another simple example of this
is chained to k,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
radioactively changed to k.
Well, let's say the radioactive

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
substance, A,
decays into,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
let's say, one atom of this
produces one atom of that for

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
simplicity.
So, it decays into B,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
which then still is radioactive
and decays further.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Okay, what's the differential
equation, which is going to be,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
it's going to govern this
situation?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
What I want to know is how much
B there is at any given time.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
So, I want a differential
equation for the quantity of the

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
radioactive product at any given
time.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Well, what's it going to look
like?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Well, it's the amount coming in
minus the amount going out,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
so to speak.
The rate of inflow minus the

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
rate of outflow,
except it's not the same type

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
of physical flow we had before.
How fast is it coming in?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Well, A is decaying at a
certain rate,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
and so the rate at which A
decays is by the basic

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
radioactive law.
It's k1, it's constant,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
decay constant,
times the amount of A present.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
If I used the differential

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
equation with A here,
I'd have to put a negative sign

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
because it's the rate at which
that stuff is leaving A.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But, I'm interested in the rate
at which it's coming in to B.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So, it has a positive sign.
And then, the rate at which B

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
is decaying, and therefore the
quantity of good B is gone,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
--
-- that will have some other

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
constant, B.
So, that will be the equation,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
and to avoid having two
dependent variables in there,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
we know how A is decaying.
So, it's k1,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000
some constant times A,
sorry, A will be e to the

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000
negative, you know,
the decay law,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
so, times the initial amount
that was there times e to the

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
negative k1 t.
That's how much A there is at

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
any given time.
It's decaying by the

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
radioactive decay law,
minus k2 B.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Okay, so how does the
differential equation look like?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
It looks like B prime plus k2 B
equals an exponential,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000
k1 A zero e to the negative k1
t.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
But, there's no reason to

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
expect that that constant really
has anything to do with k2.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It's unnatural to put it in
that form, which is the correct

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
one.
Now, in the last two minutes,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I wish to alienate half the
class by pointing out that if k

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
is less than zero,
none of the terminology of

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
transient, steady-state input
response applies.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
The technique of solving the
equation is identical.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
But, you cannot interpret.
So, the technique is the same,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
and therefore it's worth
learning.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
The technique is the same.
In other words,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
the solution will be still e to
the negative kt integral q of t

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
e to the kt dt plus

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
a constant times e to the k,
oh, this is terrible,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
no.
dy / dt, let's give an example.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000
The equation I'm going to look
at is something that looks like

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
this: y equals q of t,
let's say, okay,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
a constant, but the constant a
is positive.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So, the constant here is
negative.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Then, when I solve,
my k, in other words,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
is now properly written as
negative a.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
And therefore,
this formula should now become

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
not this, but the negative k is
a t.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And, here it's negative a t.
And, here it is positive a t.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Now, why is it,
if this is going to be the

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
solution, why are all those
things totally irrelevant?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.000
This is not a transient any
longer because if a is positive,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
this goes to infinity.
Or, if I go to minus infinity,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000
then C is negative.
So, it's not transient.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
It's not going to zero,
and it depends heavily on the

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
initial conditions.
That means that of these two

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
functions, this is the important
guy.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
This is just fixed,
some fixed function.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Everything, in other words,
is going to depend upon the

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
initial conditions,
whereas in the other cases we

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
have been studying,
the initial conditions after a

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
while don't matter anymore.
Now, why did I say I would

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
alienate half of you?
Well, because in what subjects

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
will a be positive?
In what subjects will k be

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000
negative?
k is typically negative in

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000
biology, economics,
Sloan.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000
In other words,
the simple thing is think of it

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
in biology.
What's the simplest equation

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000
for population growth?
Well, it is dP / dt equals

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
some, if the population is
growing, a times P,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
and a is a positive number.
That means P prime minus a P is

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000
zero.
So, the thing I want to leave

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
you with is this.
If life is involved,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
k is likely to be negative.
k is positive when inanimate

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.000
things are involved;
I won't say dead,

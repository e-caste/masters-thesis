00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.940
PROFESSOR: OK,
today's lecture will

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.770
begin with photon
states, which is

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.710
a very interesting
application of what

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.860
we've learned about
coherent states.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.530
And in a sense, it's
an advanced topic.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.675
Photon states are states of
the electromagnetic field.

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:50.530
They are quantum states of
the electromagnetic field.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.250
You A photon, this
particle, is a quantum

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.570
of the electromagnetic field.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.350
There's a discrete piece of
energy and momentum carried

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.160
by this particle.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.000
So when we talk
about photon states,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.430
we're really doing
quantum field theory.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.690
So in some sense,
this lecture, you

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.580
will see how quantum
field theory works.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.430
A first introduction to
quantum field theory.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.100
And it's interesting that
the harmonic oscillator

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.080
plays such an
important role in that.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.460
So a key identity that we
are going to use, of course,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.050
is this coherent
states that were

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.990
defined as displacements
of the vacuum.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.140
For D, if I remember
right, was e

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.385
to the alpha a dagger
minus alpha star a.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.730
And it had the property
that a acting on alpha

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.889
was equal to alpha--
alpha, the operator a.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.780
So these were the
coherent states

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.260
we've been talking about.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.425
And today we're going to
talk about photon states.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.090
So that will be probably
about half of the lecture.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.050
And in the second
half of the lecture,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.640
we will begin a more systematic
study of two-state systems.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.710
Two-state systems, of
course, are our spin states,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.660
are the classical
two-state system.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.310
And we're going to sort
of put it all together.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.460
We'll understand the general
dynamics of a two-spin system,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.415
what is the most general
Hamiltonian you can have,

00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:00.600
and therefore the
most General Dynamics.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.160
And then we'll solve that.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.650
And we'll have two
physical examples,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.680
one having to deal with
the ammonia molecule.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.930
And another having to do with
nuclear magnetic resonance.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.660
Both are applications
of two-state systems.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.170
So till it's the end of the
lecture, we'll be doing that.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
So about photon states.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.980
Well, photon states have to do
with electromagnetic fields.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980
That's electric and
magnetic fields.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.200
And one important
quantity that you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.020
know about the electromagnetic
fields is the energy.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.800
If you have an electromagnetic
field, you have an energy.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.660
And remember, energies have
to do with Hamiltonians.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.930
So we're going to
try to do a quantum

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.500
description of the
electromagnetic field.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.210
Therefore, knowing the energy
would be a good place to start.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.570
So the energy, as you know,
in an electromagnetic field

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.620
goes like e squared times
some epsilon and b squared.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.610
And you add the two of them.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.140
So here we go.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.340
Let me write a precise formula.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.830
The energy is equal
to 1/2 the integral

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:24.040
over volume, epsilon 0,
the electric field squared,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.040
plus c squared times the
magnetic field squared.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.695
So this is our energy.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.300
And we're going
to try to describe

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.640
a configuration of
electromagnetic fields.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.190
We will to focus on one mode
of the electromagnetic field.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.540
So I will imagine I have some
sort of cavity, finite volume.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.850
And in there I have one
electromagnetic field,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.110
what you usually called in
802 or in 8022 or 807 a wave.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.690
A single wave with some
wavelength, some frequency,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420
and that's all we have.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.970
So we're going to
simplify to the case

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.170
where we have a single one
consistent with Maxwell's

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.950
equations and some boundary
conditions that we need not

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.500
worry about.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.120
And I will normalize them
as follows with a V in here.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.590
That this is the
volume of the system.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.240
So, volume.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.250
And that could be the
volume of the cavity that

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.220
has this electromagnetic field.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.090
Or some large box.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.550
Or you can let it almost be
infinite and work with that

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.130
as well.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.210
So we'll have a wave.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.360
Omega would be the frequency.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.140
K is omega over c for
a electromagnetic wave.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.480
So we'll have this
times omega sine

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.250
of kz, a spatial distribution.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.580
And there will be a function
of time, as you know.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.570
But this function
of time, I want

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.150
to leave it a little ambiguous
at this moment-- or, general.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.470
Not ambiguous, general.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.420
So I'll call it q of t,
some function of time

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.165
to be determined.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.900
There's going to be an
electromagnetic and magnetic

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.442
component to this field, By.

00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:51.320
c times By will also
depend on z and t

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.050
and will have the
same pre-factor.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.820
I put the c here.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.760
So your c squared b
squared also works well.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.260
Epsilon 0 v.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:10.105
This time I'll put another
function, p of t cosine of kz.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.790
It's another function of time
and I just call them that way.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.996
There is a question there.

00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:25.830
STUDENT: Why is your frequency
outside your function of time?

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.220
PROFESSOR: It's just
another constant here.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.000
STUDENT: What would
that mean then?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.770
PROFESSOR: No particular
meaning to it.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.840
At this moment,
whatever this constant

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.950
is you would say
probably it's useful

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.410
because you somehow
wanted the q here.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.050
That has some meaning.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.860
So you probably would put
the same constants here

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.230
in first trial.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.010
You wouldn't have
this omega here.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.480
But if you put it, this
is just another way

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.720
of changing their own
manifestation of q.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.980
So it doesn't have a
profound meaning so far.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.460
Any other questions about this?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.810
This is and electromagnetic
field configuration.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.240
And this q of t and p of
t are functions of time.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.490
You know your
Maxwell's equations.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.490
And you will check things
related to Maxwell's equations

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.670
for this configuration
in the homework.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:35.669
But at this moment,
it's not too crucial.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.549
The thing that this
important is that we

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.110
can try to calculate
the energy now.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.560
And if you do it, well, the
squares, the epsilon 0's

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.369
are going to disappear.

00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:50.910
And you're going to
have to integrate

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:57.980
over the box, this integral of
sine squared of kz or cosine

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.210
squared of kz.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.400
The functions of
time don't matter--

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.080
this energy could
depend on time.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.570
And the way we've prepared
is when you integrate over

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.970
sine squared of kz,
if the box is big,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.490
it's a good situation where you
can replace that for 1/2, which

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.070
is the average, and 1/2
for the average of this.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:27.180
Or you could define
where the box extends,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.990
from what values of z to
what other values of z's.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.390
And so the integral, in fact,
is not any complicated integral.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.240
And we have
immediately the answer

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:50.640
that energy is 1/2 p squared
of t plus omega squared q

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.700
squared of t.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.775
And that was why
this omega was here.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.090
There's not really much to this.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.240
Except that when you square
it and you take the integral

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.340
over the volume, you replace
the sine squared by 1/2

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.900
and the cosine squared by 1/2.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.260
And that's it.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.340
So actually, the labels
that we've chosen here

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.460
are pretty good.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.290
This starts to look like
a harmonic oscillator.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.400
Except that the mass is gone.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:39.920
1 over 2m p squared should
be plus 1/2 m omega squared

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.170
q squared.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.300
So the units are wrong here.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.240
p squared over 2m
has units of energy.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.520
But p squared doesn't
have units of energy.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.760
And 1/2 m omega squared q
squared has units of energy

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.980
but this one doesn't.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.100
So the units are a little off
for a harmonic oscillator.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.430
So it's interesting
to notice now.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.190
But you couldn't
have done better.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.490
Because photons have no mass.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.250
And we're trying to describe
the electromagnetic field.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.350
It has photons.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:31.820
So there's no way this could
have showed up a mass there.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.440
There's no such thing.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.720
And that's why it
doesn't show up.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.720
On the other hand,
you can say, well, OK,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.380
let's see if this makes
a minimum of sense.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.600
How do we deal with this unit?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:58.835
So p has units of
square root of energy.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:17.072
And q has units of time
times square root of energy.

00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:18.380
Why is that?

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.800
Because omega has
units of 1 over time.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.510
So q over time
squared is energy.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:32.630
So q is t times
square root of energy.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:38.420
And therefore p doesn't have the
right units to deserve the name

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.550
p.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.520
And q doesn't have the right
units to deserve the name q.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:53.520
But p times q has the
units of time times energy,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.145
which are the units of h bar.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.990
So that's good.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:08.110
This p and q have the
right units in some sense.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:16.990
So this thing could be viewed
as an inspiration for you.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.440
And you say at
this moment, well,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.080
I don't know what is a quantum
of an electromagnetic field.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.220
But here I have a
natural correspondence

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.235
between one mode of
vibration, classical,

00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:34.160
of the electromagnetic field,
and an energy functional

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.780
that looks exactly like
a harmonic oscillator.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:46.036
So I will declare these things
to be a Hamiltonian and this p

00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:51.430
of t and q of t to be
the Heisenberg operators

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.580
of the electromagnetic field.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.720
So what we're saying
now is that I'm

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.840
going to just call
the Hamiltonian 1/2 p

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.050
hat squared plus omega
squared q hat squared.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.830
This is a time
independent Hamiltonian.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.020
If you're doing Heisenberg,
it's the same thing

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.790
as the Hamiltonian that
would have p hat square of t

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.270
plus omega q hat squared of t.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:36.250
Now, at this moment,
this might sound to you

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.750
just too speculative.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.890
But you can do a couple of
checks that this is reasonable.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:51.050
So one check, remember that the
Hamiltonian-- quantum equations

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.800
of motion, of
Heisenberg operators

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.710
should look like classical
equations of motion.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:03.460
So I can now compute
what are the Heisenberg

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.700
equation of motions
for the operators.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:15.010
Remember something like v
dt of p Heisenberg of t dt

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:20.670
is related to h
with p Heisenberg.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:26.680
And you can calculate the
Heisenberg equations of motion.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.520
I may have signs wrong here.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.070
Nevertheless, you know those
for the harmonic oscillator

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.280
and you can write them.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.600
But you also know
Maxwell's equations.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.330
And you can plug into
Maxwell's equations.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.080
And that's one check you will do
in homework, in which you will

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.760
take Maxwell's
equations and see what

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.390
equations you have
for q of t p of t.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.920
And then they will
be exactly the same

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.700
as the Heisenberg equations
of motion of this Hamiltonian,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.660
giving you evidence that this
is a reasonable thing to do.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:09.710
That we can think of this
dynamical system with q and p

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.260
being quantum operators.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:18.480
So let's accept that this is
a Hamiltonian for this quantum

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.280
system that we
want to work with.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:28.010
And therefore, write the
operators that we have.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.300
And what are they?

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.820
Well, we had
formulas with masses.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.290
But now mass goes to 1.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.850
So know the units.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.220
You cannot let in general in a
formula mass going to 1 unless

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.840
you're going to do
something with the units.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.690
But we agreed already that these
p's and q's have funny units.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.130
So those units are in fact
consistent with a mass

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.530
that has no units.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.390
And you can set it equal to 1.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.869
So I claim that you can take
all the formulas we had with m

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:14.190
and just put m equals to 1
and nothing would go wrong.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.770
Nothing goes funny.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.910
So in particular,
you had an expression

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:26.050
for x that now is called q terms
of creation and annihilation

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:34.500
operators and now
that reads-- And you

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.190
have an expression for p.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.256
And that one reads
now a minus a dagger.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.680
These formulas used
to have m's in there.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.180
And I've just set m equals to 1.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.570
And that should be
the right thing.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.640
Unit-wise, indeed h bar
omega has units of energy.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.430
And we claim that p has units of
energy, square root of energy.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.085
So this is fine.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.640
So what else do we get
from this Hamiltonian?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.960
Well, we can write it in
terms of the number operators.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:30.890
So this Hamiltonian now,
it's equal to h bar omega

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.410
a dagger a plus 1/2.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:42.470
And this is just because this
p and q written in this way

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.530
corresponds to m equals to 1.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.770
And m doesn't show up
anyway in this formula.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:54.930
So no reason to be worried
that anything has gone wrong.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:05.200
And this is H equals to h
bar omega, N hat plus 1/2.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.220
And this is a number operator.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.880
And then you get
the interpretation,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.990
the physical interpretation
that if you have states

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.200
with some number operator, the
energy is the number times h

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.840
omega, which is exactly
what we think about photons.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.510
If you have N photons
in a given state,

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.680
you would have an energy
N times h bar omega.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.790
So it may look a little
innocent what we've done here.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:48.010
But this is a
dramatic assumption.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:54.570
You've really done something
that took physicists 30 years

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.030
to figure out, how to
do quantum field theory.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.510
And of course, this is
just the very beginning.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.730
And there's lots of
things to learn about it.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.560
But the first thing
that is happening

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.430
is that somehow--
look what's happening.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:19.600
In normal quantum mechanics, x
and p became quantum operators.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.940
In a sense here, this q
and p are like x and p.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.190
But they have nothing to do with
usual position and momentum.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.950
Nothing absolutely.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.820
q is like E really.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.750
And p is like B.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.490
So who has become
a quantum operator?

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.590
Not x and p, in a sense.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.980
E and B have become
quantum operators.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.170
Quantum field theory is
the idea that the fields

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.890
become operators.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.720
That's what's really happening.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.390
And it seems to be
right in the sense

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.380
that our intuition that
the state with N photos

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.080
would be viewed as a
state of a harmonic

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.410
oscillator, an usual
one with mass equals 1.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.960
So that this really
is not a momentum

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.010
and this is not a position.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.940
But they behave as that.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:33.670
So we can turn now this
formula to its Heisenberg form

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:45.340
so that q of t is square
root of h bar over 2 omega.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.190
Remember a as a function of
time becomes e to the minus

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.720
i omega t a hat--
that's the Heisenberg

00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:03.100
version of a-- plus e to the
plus i omega t a hat dagger.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.970
So given that, we
can substitute back

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:22.100
to our electric field
that has this omega here,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.690
that has this factor in there.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.050
So I will write it
all together here.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:35.410
Therefore, Ex of z t-- and
now I've put a hat here.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:42.430
And z t, the t is the t of
a Heisenberg operator now.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:55.260
Is equal to E naught e to
the minus i omega t a plus

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:04.420
e to the i omega t a
hat dagger sine of kz,

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:12.590
where this constant E zero is
h bar omega over epsilon 0 V.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.860
It's just a mnemonic for
some constant at this moment.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.030
So we plugged-in here,
there's all these factors.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.210
There's the omega
and there's the q.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.880
So all these factors
together give you this.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.690
The factor and sine of kz.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:41.650
And this is the
electromagnetic field operator.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.150
The electric field is not
anymore an electric field.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.985
It's an operator.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.980
So if we want to
get an intuition

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.910
about this electric
field operator,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.690
let's try to find its
expectation value.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.820
It's an operator.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.160
The closest thing we can have
an intuition about an operator

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.840
is its expectation value.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.240
So very good.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.540
Let's take a photon
state and energy

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:19.860
eigenstate of the harmonic
oscillator of occupation number

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.720
n.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:29.700
And we have a state now of n
photons, an energy eigenstate.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:39.260
In fact, with energy n h omega
plus this 1/2 h bar omega.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.380
And let's figure out
what is the expectation

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.310
value of Ex in that state n.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.100
So we go to this formula.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:56.335
And we say, OK, it's E naught
e to the minus i omega t n--

00:24:56.335 --> 00:24:57.960
and we're all very curious.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.750
We want to see how the
electromagnetic field

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:05.830
of the n-th state of the
harmonic oscillator, n

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.290
photons in an energy eigenstate,
how does that wave look?

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.020
Let's see.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:27.020
n a hat n plus e to the i
omega t n a dagger n sine kz.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.350
So this is a field operator.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.370
So we put it in a
state and we want

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:40.056
to know how does the
field look in that state.

00:25:40.056 --> 00:25:42.622
And how much do we get?

00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:44.625
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:45.166
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.450
OK, that seems a little strange.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.310
Because indeed,
the matrix element

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.150
of a in an energy
eigenstate is 0.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.410
This reduces, makes n minus
1 [INAUDIBLE] to this.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.190
So this is 0.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.990
And this is n plus 1 n.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.760
This is 0.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.470
So actually no great
illumination nation

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.550
has happened.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.750
We got 0.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:22.780
So actually this
is not too strange.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.590
Energy eigenstates
are very unintuitive.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.285
The energy eigenstate of
a harmonic oscillator,

00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:32.930
the n-th state is some sort
of wave that is like that.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.290
Nothing changes in
time in that wave.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.900
Nothing all that
interesting happens.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.830
So the fact that this
electromagnetic field operator

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:49.540
has zero expectation value
on this n photon state

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.940
is maybe not too surprising.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:59.430
So let's take a more
thoughtful state.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.380
We've said so many times
that coherent states

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.120
act like classical states.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:12.570
So let's put a coherent state
of photons into this state.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.350
So let's see.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.100
Now the state will
be an alpha state,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.010
which is a coherent state.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:27.800
And therefore, the expectation
value of Ex on the alpha state

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:35.210
will be equal to E
not e to the minus i

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:42.740
omega t alpha a alpha
plus e to the plus

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:55.040
i omega t alpha a hat
dagger alpha sine of kz.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.780
Well, we're in better shape now.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.900
a on alpha is the
number alpha, as we

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.330
reviewed at the beginning.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.940
And then alpha with alpha is 1.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.440
Remember, it's a unitary
transform of the vacuum.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.460
Therefore, this
whole thing is alpha.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:20.070
So this is E not alpha being a
number e to the minus i omega

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:33.200
t plus here is alpha star e
to the i omega t sine of kz.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.520
And now we're very happy.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:42.470
The coherent state is the state
for which the expectation value

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.640
of the electromagnetic
field is precisely

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.540
the kind of waves you've
seen all your life.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.340
This wave, travelling
waves, stationary waves.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:59.950
All those only appeared
because only on coherent states

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.020
a and a dagger have
expectation values.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:09.870
So what we really call a
classical wave resonating

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:16.090
in a cavity is a coherent state
of the electromagnetic field

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.410
in this sense.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.860
The state of photons
form a coherent state.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.880
They're not an energy ion state.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.370
They're not positioned
for anything.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.230
They're not the number
eigen states either,

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.620
because they're not
energy eigen states.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.570
They have uncertainties.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.900
But they have a nice,
classical picture.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:45.630
The expectation value of
the operator is a real wave.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.840
So any time in 802 or in 8022,
you have a classical wave

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.170
to analyze, the quantum
description of that wave

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.680
is a coherent state of
the electromagnetic field.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.230
Lasers are coherent states
of the electromagnetic field.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.330
They have these uncertainties
that we discussed

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.280
last time with number and
phase that are very strong.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.380
If the number goes large,
then certainty on the face

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.890
is extremely small.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.240
So there we go.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.590
This is a coherent state.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:24.650
We can do a little more on
that, write it more explicitly.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:29.620
This is epsilon 2 E
not, the real part

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:36.905
of alpha e to the minus
i omega t sine of kz.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.100
And if we write,
for example, alpha

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:51.760
to be length of alpha
e to the i theta,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.910
then this would be 2 E not.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.080
Length of alpha would
go out, and the i theta

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.370
to minus i omega
t would give you

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:12.910
cosine of omega t
minus theta sine of kz.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:19.700
And this is something
like a standing wave.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:26.170
It just changes in time and with
a fixed spatial distribution.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:31.800
So it's a classical wave,
and nevertheless, it

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.755
has a good description
classically,

00:31:35.755 --> 00:31:38.850
a good description
quantum mechanically.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.820
It's a coherent state.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:47.220
And its energy is
the expectation value

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.035
of the Hamiltonian.

00:31:49.035 --> 00:31:52.960
The expectation
value of the energy--

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:00.570
let me write this expectation
value-- of H is H omega.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:05.840
Expectation value of N plus 1/2.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:12.080
And in a coherent state,
the expectation value of N

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.995
is alpha squared.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.350
So you have this of
the coherent state

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.130
alpha has alpha squared photons.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.490
And that's because it's
the number operator,

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:44.620
and that's pretty much the end
of our story for photon states.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.380
There's more that one could do.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:51.160
One could do basically all
kinds of things put together

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.050
different modes.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.420
We considered here one mode.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.130
You could consider
electric fields

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.470
have super procession
of modes and discuss

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.640
commutation relations
for the field operators,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.410
and all kinds of things.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.330
But that's really a quantum
field theory course.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.220
At this moment, the main
story I wanted to get across

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.900
is that naturally, the harmonic
oscillator has entered here,

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.030
but in a very funny way.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.370
q and p were not
positioned in momentum,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.330
were basically electric
field and magnetic field.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.270
And there's an
uncertainty between

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.030
electric and magnetic fields.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.770
And the result of all this is
that at the end of the day,

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:41.210
you have a description
by a harmonic oscillator

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.570
and with energy
levels that correspond

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.320
to different amount of
photons in the field.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.140
Finally, the classical
things, if you

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.600
want to recover
classical waves, you

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.670
must consider coherence states.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.810
These are the states
that were classical.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.710
When you looked at the harmonic
oscillator doing motion

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.680
and for electromagnetic
field, they

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.690
give you the
classical wave picture

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:10.000
of an electric and
magnetic field oscillating

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.520
in position and time.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.190
So are there any questions?

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.358
Yes.

00:34:17.358 --> 00:34:20.690
AUDIENCE: If we're associating
h bar with [INAUDIBLE], what

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.389
object would you associate
the zero point energy with?

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.520
PROFESSOR: Well, it's
a zero point energy

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.610
of this quantum of vibration.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:36.739
So just like an
electromagnetic field,

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:40.080
basically, if this
is like q and p,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.900
there's a minimum
energy state in which

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.790
you're in the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:51.100
But E and B cannot be zero, like
delta x and delta p cannot be

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.600
zero.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.969
So every mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:56.540
has a zero point energy.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.790
You cannot reduce it.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:01.450
So the vacuum of the
electromagnetic field

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.720
has a lot of zero
point energies,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.050
one for every mode of radiation.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:11.750
Now, that zero point energies
don't get you in trouble

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.780
unless you're trying
to do gravity.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.210
Gravity's the universal force
and universal interaction

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.300
that notes every bit of energy.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.410
So your zero point
energies are quite

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.840
important if you
consider gravity.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.390
And you would have encountered
here the first complication

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.880
associated with
quantum field theory.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.350
Every mode of the
electromagnetic field--

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.360
a frequency one, a
frequency 1.1, a frequency

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:45.090
1.2-- every one of them
has a ground state energy

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.260
of 1/2H bar omega.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.470
If you add them all
up, you get infinity.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:55.120
So you get an infinity
of ground state energies.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.480
And people have learned how
to work with this infinities.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.220
That infinity is not physical.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.850
But, if you suitably
treat it, you

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.970
can figure out all
kinds of things.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.090
And there's several
people, I think

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:11.040
even some
undergraduates, working

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.950
on this with Professor
Kardar and Professor Jaffe,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.540
called Casimir energies,
in which the zero point

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.320
energies of the
electromagnetic field

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.550
are treated in a
more careful way,

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.850
and the infinities are
seen to be irrelevant,

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.100
but there are some
physical dependence

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.710
on the parameters
that keeps there.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.180
So you see the origin of
this is because every mode

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.730
of the electromagnetic field
has a zero point energy, just

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.170
like any quantum oscillator.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.576
Yes.

00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:43.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:49.044 --> 00:36:49.960
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.540
PROFESSOR: Well,
uncountable things,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.800
we already have seen some.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.110
Maybe they didn't look
that sophisticated,

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:13.470
but we had position states
that were uncountable.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.270
So the electromagnetic field,
yes, it has uncountable things.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.465
And there's nothing
wrong about it.

00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:22.006
You just have to
work with integrals.

00:37:24.787 --> 00:37:25.703
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.290
PROFESSOR: Well, no, no.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:42.450
They're not really normalized
because just like these states,

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.760
the position states
are not normalized,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.200
they're delta function
normalized and things

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.200
like that.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.040
So look, if you want to avoid
conceptual troubles with that,

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.760
people and many
physicists and textbooks

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:03.120
on quantum field theory begin
with space, a big, big, box.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.680
And then you see that it
works for any size box,

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.000
and then you say, well, it will
work if the box is infinite.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.540
And we just proceed.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.240
All right.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.910
So I'll move on now to the
second part of the lecture

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:23.400
that deals with two-state
systems and spin

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.160
states and goes back and puts
together a few of the things

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.980
we've been doing.

00:38:33.357 --> 00:38:34.190
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.076
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:38:35.076 --> 00:38:35.520
AUDIENCE: Could you
close the sun shade?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.170
I can't really see the board.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.560
PROFESSOR: OK, sure.

00:38:42.285 --> 00:38:42.785
Board.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:55.400
I think maybe we
need all the way?

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.060
No, that won't
make a difference.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.385
It's the other shades, I think.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.050
I'll leave it like that.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.960
Maybe I should use another
board for the people

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.000
that watch these movies.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.380
That may be better.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.330
So let's do this board.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.025
OK, so here's what we
want to understand.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:29.515
Two-state systems.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.500
It's probably going
to be about this,

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.290
and two more lectures on that.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:45.410
And what we want to understand
first is spin procession.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.550
You say, well, spin
procession looks

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:52.020
like a very particular
kind of problem.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.040
When you have spins, you
have magnetic fields.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.900
But at the end of the
day, what we will see

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.820
is that spin process-- you
can view any two-state system

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.980
as a system in which you've
put a spin in a magnetic field.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:11.200
Even though you may be
talking about electrons

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.580
shared between two atoms, or
ammonia molecule, or anything

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.240
like that.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.750
Mathematically, you go
back always to spins.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:25.330
Because spins are things we
have become familiar already.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.570
So we exploit that
to the maximum.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:34.780
So we do the one thing we
haven't done rigorously so far,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.600
and then we'll explore
this analogy to some point.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.350
So what was our
discussion of spin?

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.040
So two-state systems, and we'll
begin with spin procession.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:57.150
So the idea of spin procession
all arises, as you remember,

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:02.920
because if you have a charged
particle that has some spin,

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.310
there's a relation between
the particle's magnetic moment

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:11.320
and the spin, or the angular
momentum, of that particle,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.000
of that little ball of material.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.110
And we made an argument
that this was just

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.320
q over 2m times the
angular momentum.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.940
And this will be
angular momentum.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.720
This was classical.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.040
Nevertheless, the
fact that we claim

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.170
is true quantum mechanically
is that in fact this idea is

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:45.380
roughly right, except that
there's two modifications.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.480
The true magnetic moment that
enters into the Hamiltonian

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.910
under the particle has
is not quite the same

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.350
as suggested by the
classical argument,

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.783
but it's modified by a g factor.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.670
And that modification
is important.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:14.770
And this S is not just a plain
classical angular momentum

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.130
of a rotated ball with
some mass and some radius,

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:22.565
but it's a spin angular momentum
and intrinsic angular momentum.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.690
A rather abstract
thing that in fact

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:35.340
should be best viewed
as an operator,

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.280
and that's the way
we've thought about it.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.920
The magnetic [INAUDIBLE]
now becomes an operator,

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.370
because it's proportional
to the spin operator.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.620
So it's an operator.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:59.320
And different values of g
apply for different particles.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.900
And we saw that g equals 2
applies for the electron.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.620
That's a famous value,
in fact predicted

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.220
by Dirac's equation,
relativistic equation,

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:17.800
for the electron, and observed
to great accuracy of course

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.780
as well.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.350
And for other particles, like
the proton or the neutron,

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.240
the quantity g has
different values.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.440
You might be surprised that the
neutron has a dipole moment.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.190
Because you would say a neutron
is an uncharged particle,

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.980
so a charge rotating
doesn't do anything.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.120
Nevertheless, a
neutron is uncharged,

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.060
but it has three quarks,
two with some charge, one

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.890
with an opposite charge
to the other two.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:51.130
And if they distribute cleverly,
say the negative ones are

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.910
farther away from the
center, and in the center

00:43:53.910 --> 00:44:01.090
is the positive one, this could
have angular magnetic moment.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.960
And in fact, it does
have magnetic moment.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.910
The neutron has a
significant magnetic moment.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.040
So at the end of
the day, we're going

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:19.780
to write this as
mu equal gamma S.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:24.516
And this constant gamma is going
to summarize everything, g, q,

00:44:24.516 --> 00:44:27.940
m, all these things.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.560
And this will be
a good notation.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.410
Gamma S is brief and simple.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.370
And this constant,
we're going to use it.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:49.180
So the Hamiltonian minus mu
dot B is a quantum Hamiltonian

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.490
because mu is an operator.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.760
B, at this moment, even
though we were just

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.090
talking about
photon states, this

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.890
will be a static
magnetic field typically.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:03.560
Can be a to time
dependent, but it will not

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.610
be sufficiently important
if it has time dependence,

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:11.030
and we have to quantize it and
to think of it as a quantum

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.740
field.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.040
But in some problems
of radiation

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.280
of electromagnetic fields
by the motion of spins,

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.580
you would have to quantize
the electromagnetic field.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.290
But this is not the case now.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:31.080
So this is minus gamma S
dot B. And we typically

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:38.730
like to write it as
minus gamma B dot S.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:47.050
And that means very explicitly
minus gamma BxSx operator

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:52.781
plus BySy operator
plus BzSz operator.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:03.540
So let me remind you of
a simple situation when

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.640
you had a magnetic field
in the z direction.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:17.370
B along z if B is B times z hat.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:26.351
Then H is minus gamma.

00:46:26.351 --> 00:46:26.850
BSz.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.370
And the unitary operator
that generates time evolution

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:49.210
of states, the unitary operator
u of t0 is exponential minus i.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.440
I'll call it H sub s for spin.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.080
H sub s t over H bar.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:10.790
And I'll put it like this
exponential of minus i minus

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:18.080
gamma B t Sz over H bar.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.850
So I substituted
what Hs is, moved

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:29.020
the t sort of inside the
parentheses minus gamma B Sz.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.890
I put the z out
and put this here.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.930
So far so good?

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.300
This is our time
development operator.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.500
Now, I want you to recall
one property that you only

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.440
justified by checking
it in the homework.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.770
But in the next few
lectures, we will just

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.540
make sure you understand this
why it's true in general.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:04.630
But we talked in the homework
about an operator Rn sub alpha,

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:14.670
which was exponential of
minus i alpha Sn over H bar.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.320
Where n was a unit
vector, and Sn

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:34.905
is defined as n dot S.
So nxSx, nySy, nzSz.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.720
So this operator
that you considered

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.730
was called the
rotation operator,

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.740
and it did perform
rotation of spin states.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:59.560
In fact, what it did was rotate
any spin state by an angle,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.550
alpha, around the nth direction.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.430
So if you had the
n direction here,

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:23.000
and you had any spin state
in some arbitrary direction,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.920
it would rotate it by an
angle alpha around this.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.595
So you have this,
it would rotate it

00:49:30.595 --> 00:49:37.390
to another point over here
with an angle alpha in between.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:43.800
So in words, it rotates
by an angle alpha,

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.830
rotates spin states.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.370
And when you think
of a spin state,

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:58.520
you must think of some n
vector, n prime vector.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.240
So maybe n prime here
would be a good notation.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.760
So you have a spin state
in the n prime direction.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.090
Remember your spin states
were of the form n plus minus.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.150
Well, the state that
points in the direction n

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.900
is n plus, so some
n prime direction.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:26.510
This operator rotates those
states by an angle alpha.

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:30.820
Now, it probably is a little
vague in your mind, that idea,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.450
because you checked
it several weeks ago.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.450
And you only checked it by
taking some particular states

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.500
and rotating them.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:42.380
So we will have to elaborate
on this, and we will.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.890
So this will become
clear that this

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:55.500
rotates any spin state by
an angle alpha and rotates

00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:02.900
spin states using an
axis, with respect

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.800
to the axis defined
by n over here.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.810
So that's interpretation of
this state, of this operator.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.260
That's what it does.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.823
And now I want you to
look at this operator.

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.480
Well, it's similar.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.820
In fact, this plays
the role of alpha,

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.105
and this plays the role of Sn.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.950
So this is the spin
in the z direction,

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.820
and this operator
must rotate states

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:43.120
by this angle alpha,
which is gamma Bt.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:49.840
If what we said is right, that's
what this operator must do.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.010
Even though I think you've
done this calculation as part

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.730
of tests, problems,
or other problems,

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.510
practice problems,
not quite homework.,

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.580
I want to do this
calculation again.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:10.490
So let's take an
arbitrary spin state, xyz.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:20.000
Now, don't confuse the arbitrary
spin states with the n here.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.310
The n is here the
axis around which

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.540
this Hamiltonian rotates states.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.010
But there's no states here.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.909
This is a rotation operator.

00:52:28.909 --> 00:52:30.450
I'm sorry, I called
it a Hamiltonian.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:31.770
It's not precise.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:34.090
This is a unitary operator.

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.200
It rotates states.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.500
And this is the direction,
the axis, of rotation.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.790
Your spin state
is another object.

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.420
It's a spin that lives
in some direction.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.300
So here, we're having
the magnetic field

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.450
in the z direction.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:51.460
So the magnetic field is here.

00:52:54.710 --> 00:53:00.080
And we'll put a spin state over
here, an n, a spin state that

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.815
has some value of phi
and some value of theta.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.410
And that's the spin state
at time equals zero.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:18.430
So psi 0 is the spin state this
that with your formula sheet,

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:24.930
this cosine theta over 2
plus plus sine theta over 2 e

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:29.360
to the i phi, I think
with a plus, yes.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:38.800
I'll call it phi not, and
maybe theta 0, y 0, and minus.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.140
So this is a state,
a spin state pointing

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.610
in this direction,
the direction n.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:49.810
That was the general
formula for a spin state.

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:55.520
Now we are going to apply the
operator, the time evolution

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.800
operator.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.660
But let's do a
preliminary calculation.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:15.190
HS on plus is minus gamma B
Sz on plus minus gamma B H

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:22.510
bar over 2 plus, and Hs
minus is equal to minus

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:31.200
gamma BSz on minus equal plus
gamma B H bar over 2 minus.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.360
So we want to add with this
operator on this state.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.610
So here we have it,
the state that any time

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:54.740
is going to be E to the
minus iHst over H bar times

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:59.380
this state over here
acting on psi is 0.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:07.050
So let's do it.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:12.370
Well, on the first term
is cosine theta 0 over 2.

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:16.560
And you have this
exponent acting on plus.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.360
But the exponent has Hs
that's acting on plus is this.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.810
So you can just put that
thing on the exponent.

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:30.470
So you put e to the
minus i, and Hs on plus

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:38.220
is this, minus gamma
B H bar over 2.

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:44.820
Then you have the p and
the H bar and the plus.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:54.730
And continue here.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:10.610
So we just need to do the second
term, plus sine theta over 2,

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.440
e to the minus i.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.000
And now the same thing,
but with a plus sign.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.940
Plus gamma B H bar over 2, t
over H bar on the minus state.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.800
So just in case I
got you confused

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.320
and the small type
is a problem here,

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.790
this operator active on initial
state just acts on plus,

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:39.770
then acts on minus.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.940
On plus, the operator
is an eigen state.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.550
So you can just put the
number in the exponential.

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:51.270
So you put the plus eigen
value, the minus eigen value.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.890
So what do we get?

00:56:54.890 --> 00:57:01.486
Psi t is equal, cosine
theta not over 2,

00:57:01.486 --> 00:57:15.290
e to the i gamma B t over 2
plus sine theta not over 2, e

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:23.270
to the minus i gamma
B t over 2 minus.

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:25.250
Now, this state
this is not quite--

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.730
I hope I got my signs right.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:28.230
Yes.

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.520
This state is not
quite in readable form.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.750
To compare it with
a general end state,

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:39.430
you need null phase here.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:44.100
So we must factor
this phase out.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.400
e to the i gamma B t over 2.

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.140
And it's an irrelevant phase.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:54.370
So then you have cosine theta
not over 2 plus sine theta not

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.010
over 2.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:58:00.105
I'm sorry, I forgot to have
the e to the i phi not here.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.750
I didn't copy it.

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.840
So here, what do we have?

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:27.050
e to the i phi not
minus gamma B t minus.

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:30.520
Look, when you
factor this one out,

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.150
you get minus the
same thing here.

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:36.160
So this becomes a minus 1.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.040
And then you put the two faces
together, and you got that.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.770
So now you look at
this state, and you

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:44.305
say, oh, I know what this is.

00:58:44.305 --> 00:58:49.440
This is a spin
state that has theta

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.130
as a function of
time, just theta not.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.460
But the angle, phi,
as a function of time

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:01.780
is phi not minus gamma B t.

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:12.080
So this spin will precess
and will go like this.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:26.750
Phi not minus gamma B t is
the phi as a function of time.

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:30.420
So have the magnetic field.

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:34.790
You have a procession
of the spin over here.

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.450
So this is spin procession.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:45.320
And indeed, this is exactly
what we're claiming here.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.030
If this rotates states
by an angle alpha,

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:53.650
this operator, this Hamiltonian
that we've discussed here,

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:59.540
must rotate states by this angle
alpha, which is minus gamma Bt,

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.370
along the z-axis.

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:05.990
So you have the z-axis, and
you rotate by minus gamma Bt.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:12.190
The sine is the reason the
phi decreases in time and goes

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:17.900
in this direction, as opposed
to going in the other direction.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.340
So this is a basic confirmation
of what the spin is doing.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.540
And I want to give
you the general result

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.920
so that you can really
use it more clearly.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.030
So I think the lights
are gone, so we

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.420
can go to this blackboard.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.270
First of all, classical picture.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.310
What is it about
spin procession?

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.870
Is it a quantum phenomenon or a
classical phenomenon, or both?

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.250
Well, it's really both.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.980
And this idea of
procession, you can get it

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.280
from the classical
picture as well.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.540
So what do you have?

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:03.760
If you have a mu in a B
field, you get a torque.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.890
And that you can easily
convince yourself.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.820
I'm sure you've done
the computation in 802.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.440
You have a little
square wire not

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.240
aligned with the magnetic field.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.110
You calculate the force on one
side, the force on the other.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:25.070
You see that there is a torque.

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:32.295
And the torque is given
by mu cross B. That's enm.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:42.170
On the other hand, the rate
of change of angular momentum

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.060
is the torque.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:57.430
So this is mu cross B.
But mu is gamma S, so this

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:15.520
is gamma S cross B. And this
is minus gamma B cross S.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.380
OK.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:26.140
This equation, which I
rewrite it here, ds/dt equals

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:34.650
minus gamma B cross S,
is a particular case

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:42.460
of a very famous equation
in classical mechanics,

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.940
and this equation for
a rotating vector.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:03:05.515
If you have a vector,
dx/dt is omega cross x.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.790
This is the equation
satisfied by a vector

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:17.670
x that is rotating
with angular frequency

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:23.710
omega around the axis
defined by the vector omega.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.430
A famous equation.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:32.500
OK, so you have here
omega vector is omega n.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.430
So here is the direction
of n, the unit vector.

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.630
Here's omega.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.310
And you have a
vector x over here.

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:43.560
Then this vector, the
solution of this equation,

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:50.270
is a vector that is rotating
around omega with the angular

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.860
velocity magnitude of omega.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.130
In the notes, I just
give a little hint

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:58.640
of how you derive that.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.860
But truly speaking,
you guys should

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.870
be able to just
scribble a few notes

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.290
if you don't know the situation
by heart, and convince yourself

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.320
this is true.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.690
So this equation is
of that form in which

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:23.750
the omega x is played by
S. Omega is minus gamma B.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:30.010
So this defines what is called
the Larmor frequency, which

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:37.455
is minus gamma B, is
the Larmor frequency.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.600
Now, this Larmor
frequency is precisely

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.520
that one because
was minus gamma B.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.470
And here you have
minus gamma B times t.

01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.570
Omega times t is the angle.

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:05.960
So in fact, this is rotating
with a Larmor frequency.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.930
And there you go.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.420
In the same blackboard, you
have a classical mechanics

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.810
derivation of the
Larmor frequency

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.900
and a quantum
mechanical derivation

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.730
of the Larmor frequency.

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:20.700
Again, at the end of the
day, this is no coincidence.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.380
We've made dynamical
classical variables

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:30.700
into quantum operators, and we
haven't changed the physics.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.650
Mu dot B is a classical energy.

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:38.270
Well, it became Hamiltonian,
and it's doing the right thing.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:42.460
So we can now use
the Larmor frequency

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.110
to rewrite the
Hamiltonian, of course.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:46.755
It's here.

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.680
So a little bit of
emphasis is worth it.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:03.750
Hs is minus mu dot B, and
it's minus gamma B dot S,

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:13.450
and it's finally equal
to omega L dot S.

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:17.550
So if somebody gives
you a Hamiltonian

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:21.070
that at the end of the
day, you can write it

01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:28.270
as some vector dot S, you
already know that for spins,

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:33.710
that is the Larmor
frequency of rotation.

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.890
It's a very simple thing.

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:40.140
Hs, something times
S, well that's

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:45.340
precisely the rotation
frequency for the spin states.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.200
They will all rotate that way.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.000
So we can say that the spin
states in this Hamiltonian

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.510
rotate with omega L frequency.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:02.180
So that's good.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:06.980
That's a general discussion of
precession in a magnetic field.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:12.600
But I want to go one more
step in generalization.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.820
It's a simple step,
but let's just take it.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.740
So that you see
even more generally

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:25.045
why any system can be
thought of as a spin system.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.310
And this is quite practical.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:34.150
In fact, it's
probably the best way

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:39.030
to imagine physically, the
effects of any Hamiltonian.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:44.320
So let's consider
time-independent Hamiltonians

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:50.070
the most general Hamiltonian
for a two-state system.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.250
How can it be?

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.210
Well, a two-state
system, remember

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:56.620
two-state system is a word.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:03.450
It really means a system
with two basis states.

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:06.150
Once you have two basis
states, a plus and the minus

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:08.810
have infinitely many
states, of course.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:12.700
But two-state system
is two basis states.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.330
And therefore, in
the Hamiltonian,

01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:19.930
in this two basis states,
is a 2 by 2 matrix.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:22.350
And it's a 2 by 2
Hermitian matrix.

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:25.710
So there's not too
much it can be.

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:28.800
In fact, you can have
a constant that I

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:38.000
will call maybe not the base
notation, g not and g not.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.569
And that's Hermitian.

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:42.960
It's real constant.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.620
You can put a g3 and a minus g3.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.380
That's still Hermitian.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.790
And that's reasonable.

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:54.590
There's no reason why this
number should be equal to this.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:59.090
So there are two numbers here
that are arbitrary, real.

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:01.460
And therefore, you can put
them wherever you want.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:08.260
And I decided to call one g not
plus g3 and one g not minus g3.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.760
Here, I can put again an
arbitrary complex number,

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.310
as long as I put here
the complex conjugate.

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:25.399
So I will call this g1 minus
ig2, and this g1 plus ig2.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:28.620
And that's the most
general 2 by 2 Hamiltonian.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.100
Tonya If those would be
time-dependent functions,

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.680
this is the most general
Hamiltonian ever for a 2

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.430
by 2 system.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:39.490
It doesn't get more complicated.

01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:42.399
That's a great
advantage of this.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.630
But I've written it
in a way that you

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.109
can recognize something.

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:49.910
You can recognize
that this is g not

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:56.420
times the identity plus g1 times
sigma 1 plus g2 times sigma

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:01.390
2 plus g3 times sigma 3.

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:05.680
And this is because the
Pauli matrices are, together

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.310
with the unit matrix, a
basis for all Hermitian 2

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:14.500
by 2 matrices.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.980
So the Pauli matrices
are Hermitian.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.920
The unit matrix is Hermitian.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.590
The most general 2
by 2 Hermitian matrix

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:25.890
is a number times the one
matrix, then number times

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.470
the first part, then number,
second, number, third.

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:31.840
OK.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.890
So at this moment, we've got
the most general Hamiltonian.

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:42.540
And I will write it as g
not times 1 plus g vector

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:51.340
dot sigma, where g
vector is g1, g2, g3.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:03.050
If we write the g
vector as length

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:07.840
of g, which is
just the letter g,

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.520
shouldn't be confused because
we have g not, g1, g2, g3,

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.430
but we haven't had a
g without an index.

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.760
So g without an index is
going to be the magnitude of g

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.640
vector, and n is going to
be a particular vector.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.860
So look, you're talking about
the most general Hamiltonian,

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:31.280
and you're saying it's
most easily understood

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.200
as g not multiplying
the identity, and that g

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.525
vector multiplying
the sigma vector.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.870
So on the other hand, g is this.

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:51.040
So this is also g not 1
plus g times n dot sigma.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.945
But let's continue here.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.930
We know how to
solve this problem.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.330
And you can say,
well, all right.

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:16.740
I have to diagonalize this
matrix, find the eigen vectors,

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.612
find the eigenvalues,
and all that.

01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:23.470
But you've done all that work.

01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:25.830
It's already been done.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.120
What were the eigen states?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.620
Well, n dot sigma,
the eigen states

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:39.200
were the end states, the
spin states, n plus minus.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.090
And they were plus minus
n comma plus minus.

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:53.720
Remember that S
is H over 2 sigma.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:01.840
So this corresponds to n dot
S on n plus minus equal plus

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.080
minus H bar over 2
n plus minus, which

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.560
might be the form in which
you remember it better.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.180
But the sigma
matrices, n dot sigma

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.660
is diagonalized
precisely by this thing.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:22.810
So in fact, you never have
to diagonalize this matrix.

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.760
It's already been done for you.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.060
And these are the eigen
states of this Hamiltonian.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:37.650
And what is the value of
the energy on n plus minus?

01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:44.570
Well, energy on n plus minus
is g not times 1 plus g n

01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:48.985
dot sigma on the n plus minus.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.790
And g not times 1
here on this state

01:13:55.790 --> 01:14:03.830
is g not plus g n dot sigma,
the thing is plus minus.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:11.250
So plus minus g, n plus minus.

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:15.680
So in fact, you
have the energies,

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.960
and you have the eigen vectors.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:31.076
So the eigen states are n plus
with energy equal g not plus g

01:14:31.076 --> 01:14:38.670
and n minus with energy
equal g not minus g.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.220
So what we did by inventing
the Pauli matrices

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.530
and inventing spin
states and all

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:55.230
that was solve for
you the most general 2

01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:58.930
by 2 Hamiltonian,
Hermitian Hamiltonian.

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.440
If you have a 2 by
2 Hermitian matrix,

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.320
you don't have to
diagonalize it by hand.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.760
You know the answers
are this state.

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.470
And how do you
build those states?

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:16.470
Well, you know what n is
because you know the g's.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.210
If you know the three g's,
you know what the vector g is.

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.000
You know what the vector n is.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.640
You know what this g is as well.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.630
And therefore, with
a vector n, you

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.170
construct this state, as
you know already very well.

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:34.060
And given that you
know g and g not,

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:41.040
well the energies are
this, at the splitting

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.800
is 2g between those states.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.560
This is the ground state.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.180
This is the excited state.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.370
Splitting two g's, so you
look at the Hamiltonian,

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.080
and you say, what's the
splitting between the two eigen

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.020
states of this.

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:05.620
You just take this numbers,
compute g, and multiply by 2.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:09.250
Now, last thing
that you would want

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:13.720
to do with this Hamiltonian
is time evolution.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.380
So what do we say
about time evolution?

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:25.700
Well, we have here
H is equal to this.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:48.530
And we also had omega L dot
S. So omega L dot S in here

01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:51.950
should be identified with this.

01:16:51.950 --> 01:17:00.020
So sigma and S, as you remember,
S is equal H bar over 2 sigma.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:07.150
So this term can be
written as g vector sigma.

01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:09.790
In fact, this is
better from here.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:14.790
g vector sigma, and
sigma is H bar over 2S.

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:21.640
I got a 2 over H bar.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.190
2 over H bar S.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:37.685
So from here, g dot sigma is
2g over H bar S. And remember,

01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:44.370
a Hamiltonian for a
spin system, whatever's

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:47.830
multiplying the vector
that is multiplying S

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:52.970
is omega L. So in
this system-- I

01:17:52.970 --> 01:18:00.850
will write it like that--
omega L is 2g over H bar.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.920
And this is a great
physical help.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.080
Because now that
you have this, I

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.530
should remark this
part of the Hamiltonian

01:18:14.530 --> 01:18:16.840
is the one that does procession.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:21.640
A part proportional to the
identity cannot do procession,

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:27.000
is just a constant term that
produces a constant phase,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.490
just produces a pure phase.

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.060
That's a change,
an overall phase

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.310
that doesn't change the state.

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:39.230
You would have an extra factor
of e to the minus i times

01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:44.260
that constant, g
not t over H bar,

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.280
multiplying all the states.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.970
Doesn't change the action
on plus or minus state.

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:52.120
It's an overall phase.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.960
This term in the Hamiltonian
is almost never very important.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.130
It doesn't do anything
to the physical states,

01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:02.550
just gives them pure phases.

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:05.200
And this term is the
thing that matters.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.590
So now with this
Hamiltonian, because g

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:11.570
dot sigma is the form
of the Hamiltonian,

01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:15.350
and we've identified this
physical phenomenon of Larmor

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:21.170
frequency, if you know your
vector g for any Hamiltonian,

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:25.160
this might be the [INAUDIBLE]
for ammonia molecule,

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.830
then you know how the
states evolve in time.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.840
Because you represent the state.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.370
You have one state
and a second state.

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.950
You think of the one
state as the plus

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:40.420
of a spin, the minus of a spin.

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:43.890
And then you know that this
is processing with this Larmor

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.840
frequency.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.050
So it may sound a little
abstract at this moment,

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:54.130
but this gives you the way
to evolve any arbitrary state

01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:55.290
intuitively.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.530
You know the vector
V where it points.

01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:02.500
You know where your state points
in the configuration space.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.240
And you have a physical picture
of what it does in time.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.350
It's always precessing.

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:12.930
Therefore, the dynamics of
a two-state system in time

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:16.410
is always procession, and
that's what we have to learn.

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:21.580
So next time will be ammonia
molecule, and then NMR.

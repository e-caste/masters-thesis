00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.790
PROFESSOR: We have to set up
a little better the geometry

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.820
of the calculation.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.890
And for that we have to
think of various angles.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.940
We oriented there the electric
field along the z direction.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.940
But that's not going to be too
convenient for our calculation.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.850
So these calculations are
a bit of an art to do them.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.840
They're not that trivial.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.100
Not terribly difficult. But
I think if you appreciate it,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.580
next time you ever have
to do one of these things

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.990
it will become clear.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.300
So first your have
to think physically.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.300
Is there an angle
in this problem?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
Is there any important
angle happening here?

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.620
It's a question to you.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.020
I think if you figure out that
you have a chance of doing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.410
a diagram that reflects this.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.155
Is there a physical angle,
you think, in this process?

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:25.920
A relevant angle?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.610
Yes, Lou?

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.179
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.970
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.230
Yeah.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.550
The relevant angle is
you have a directional

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.430
ready for the electric field.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.000
So if the electron
comes off there's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520
going to be an angle with
respect to that electric field.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.270
So that's our physical
angle in this question.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.670
So let's try to
draw this in a way.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.250
So I will draw it this way.

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:02.060
And I brought colored
chalk for this.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.259
I'll put the z-axis here, and
I'll put the electron momentum

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.340
in this direction.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.150
k is the lateral momentum.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.630
Now the electric
field is going to come

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.840
at some angle with
respect to the--

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.140
or the electron momentum is
at some angle with respect

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.200
to the electric field.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.370
So that angle will
presumably stay there

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.900
for the rest of the calculation.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.100
So let's do it with green.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.910
So here is my electric field.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.570
And it's going to have an
angle theta with respect

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.830
to the direction of the electric
field or the photon incident

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.460
direction.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.500
Now, this is actually more like
the polarization of the photon.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.470
The electric field is the
direction of the polarization

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.320
of the photon.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.230
So one more vector, however,
the position that we

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.280
have to integrate over--

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.450
because we have the whole
hydrogen atom and the whole

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.010
of space to integrate.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.940
So x has a position.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.940
So I'll use another color here.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.060
Unfortunately, the colors
are not that different.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.140
Here is r, the vector r.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.140
So now I have several angles.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.710
I have theta for
the electric field.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:55.040
But now that I've put all this
axis I not only have theta,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.080
but I also have phi
for the electric field.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:14.010
And for r, I will have
theta prime and phi prime.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.160
So r has a theta
prime and a phi prime.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.300
We usually have theta and phi.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.960
But the answers, at
the end of the day,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.465
are going to depend on theta.

00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:38.550
And if you have theta here,
we want the theta to remain.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.210
So theta prime and
phi prime are going

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.650
to be our variables
of integration

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.860
because you integrate over r.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.370
Finally, we have one more
angle that we have to define.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.380
So we have theta phi,
theta prime, phi prime,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.480
and the angle that was here--

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.330
this was the angle between
r and the direction

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.600
of the electric field.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
And we called it theta.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.480
So we have to give
it a new name here.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.720
And this angle, I'll
call it gamma here.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.600
The angle between E and r.

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:29.656
OK.

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:37.060
So We have everything
defined here.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.280
Maybe I should list it.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.070
E has angles theta and
phi, the direction of E. r

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.840
has angles theta
prime and phi prime.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.460
And gamma is the
angle between E and r.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.670
And k along z hat.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.780
So this is our situation.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.030
So what are we
trying to calculate?

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.820
Well, we want to use
Fermi's golden rule.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:35.770
So we need to calculate
final H prime initial.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.560
That's the matrix element
of the Hamiltonian H

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.510
prime between the final
and initial states.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.490
So what is this?

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.560
Well, these are
all wave functions

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.990
that depend all over space, and
this is a function of space.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.900
So let's do it.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.330
This is integral d cubed x.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.280
Let's put the final state first
because it shows up there.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.460
So it's 1 over L cubed e
to the minus i k dot r.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.970
So here is our final
state, u final.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.795
Then the Hamiltonian.

00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:25.010
That's simple.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.785
e E0 r cosine what?

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.520
Cosine gamma.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.420
Is that right?

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.670
This is what we had there.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.150
It's the angle between
the electric field and r.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.075
It was theta to begin
but now has become gamma.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.130
And then the final state.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.040
So this is our H prime.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.030
And then the initial state
is 1 over pi a0 cubed

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.430
e to the minus r over a0.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.370
OK.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.220
This is our task.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.220
This is a matrix,
and here it is.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.810
An integral of a plane wave
against an electron wave

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.500
function and an extra
r dependence here.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:33.114
This could range from undoable
to difficult, basically.

00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:37.210
And happily, it's just
a little difficult.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.220
But this is an integral--

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.470
we'll see what are the
challenges on this integral.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.060
So let's take a
few constants out.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:54.050
So e, E0, pi, a0,
that all will go out.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:03.760
So this is e E0 over square
root of pi l cubed a0 cubed.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.390
So I took the l's out,
the e, E, this thing.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.040
All right.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.590
Let's write the integral
more explicitly.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:26.240
This is r squared dr
sine the volume element.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.250
Sine theta d theta d phi.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.350
But I'm integrating over x,
which is integrating over r.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.240
And r is theta
prime and phi prime.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.400
So these are all these ones.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.030
I'm integrating over all values
of theta prime and phi prime.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.750
Then what do I have?

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.240
I have this exponent, k dot r.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.675
Well, my diagram shows
how k dot r is easy.

00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:05.410
It involves a cosine
of theta prime.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:12.780
So it's e to the minus
ik, the magnitude of k,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.590
the magnitude of r
cosine theta prime,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.860
because after all, k
was along the z-axis.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.498
r is along the phi
theta prime direction.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.320
OK.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.020
We're progressing.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:36.630
This, this, that term,
it's r cosine gamma.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.470
And the final term is not that
difficult. e to the minus r

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.080
over a0.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.370
That's what we have to do.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.810
An integral over phi
prime, theta prime, and r.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.440
This is our challenge.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:06.740
And the reason it's a
challenge is the cosine gamma

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.650
because this gamma is the angle.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.880
It depends on theta, depends
on theta prime, depends on phi,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.280
phi prime.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.350
That's the problem.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.950
If we can solve that
cosine gamma thing

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.140
we can do this integral.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.200
And I think even if you
were doing it numerically,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.130
that cosine gamma there is
a little bit of a headache.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.460
You don't want to do an
integral that you can really

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.590
do like this numerically.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.910
So you really want to do it.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.820
So what we need is to calculate.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.700
So we can begin by
saying, I'm going

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.640
to calculate what
cosine gamma is.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.420
And here is the way you
can calculate cosine gamma.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.560
When you have two
unit vectors, cosine

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.110
of the angle between
two unit vectors

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.550
is just the dot product
of those two unit vectors.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:12.060
So for gamma, we can consider
a unit vector along e

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.730
and a unit vector along r
and take the dot product.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.460
And remember, for an
arbitrary unit vector,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:36.420
it's sine theta cos phi sine
theta sine phi cos theta.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.030
This is the theta
phi decomposition

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.620
of an arbitrary unit vector.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:49.590
So cosine gamma
is the dot product

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:59.680
of a vector n along the e
times a vector n along r.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.460
And vector n along
e and r are just

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.810
with theta in one case and phi
and theta prime and phi prime.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.710
So when I make
the dot product, I

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:23.980
get sine theta, cos phi, sine
theta prime, cos phi prime.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.150
That is the product
of the x components.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:40.950
Plus sine theta, sine phi prime
times sine theta and sine phi.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:48.790
Sine theta prime sine phi
prime, plus cos theta,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.950
cos theta prime.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:53.920
OK.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.490
Doesn't look much easier,
but at least it's explicit.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.385
But it's actually much easier.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.720
And why is that?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.290
Because there's a lot of
factors in common here.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:32.535
In fact, sine theta and sine
theta prime are in both.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.880
So what you get
here is cosine gamma

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.540
is equal to sine theta
sine theta prime.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.970
And then you have
cos phi, cos phi

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.570
prime, plus sine
phi, sine phi prime.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:07.630
And that's cosine of phi minus
phi prime plus cos theta cos

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.290
theta prime.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.100
OK.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.040
So that's cosine gamma.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.350
Now suppose you were to put
this whole thing in here.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:26.070
It's a big mess but all
quantities that we know.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.520
But there's one
nice thing, though--

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.430
a very nice thing happening.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.145
Think of the interval
over d phi prime.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.560
This does not
depend on phi prime.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.410
This does not
depend on phi prime.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.950
But cosine gamma can
depend on phi prime.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:55.160
But here it has this thing,
cosine of phi minus phi prime.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.540
So when you try to do the
integral of this phi prime

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.650
with this term,
this term will give,

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.680
eventually, the integral
of d phi prime times

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.370
cosine of phi minus phi prime.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.100
There is a lot of messy things.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.440
But this integral
is 0 because you

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.040
are averaging over a full term.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:28.260
So happily, all this
term will not contribute.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.210
And that's what makes
the integral doable.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.700
So what do we have then?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:42.290
Our whole matrix
element, f H prime i,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:52.475
has become e E0 over square
root of pi l cube a0 cube.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.000
And now you just
have to integrate.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.430
This is the only term
that contributes.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.859
And when you put
this term, for sure

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:19.210
you can now do the
d phi prime integral

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.410
because that term
is phi dependent.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.890
So that integral gives
you just a factor

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:32.210
of 2 pi from the
integral of d phi.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.290
And from this
thing, cosine theta

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.830
is the angle between the
electric field and k.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.140
So it's a constant
for your integral.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.930
You're integrating over
theta prime and phi prime.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.330
So cosine theta also goes out.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.530
And here is the
integral that remains.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:58.020
r cube dr. It was r squared,
but there was an extra r

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.740
from the perturbation.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:06.690
r cubed dr into the
minus a over r--

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.690
r over a0.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:17.170
And this thing you can
pass two cosine variables.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.340
It's pretty useful.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:25.290
So this goes minus
1 to 1 d cos theta

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:33.395
prime, cos theta prime e to
the minus ikr cos theta prime.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.420
This cos theta prime
came from here.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.010
And that's it.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:19:01.160
So this is a nice result.
It looks still difficult,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.180
but we've made great progress.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.800
And in fact, we've dealt
with a really difficult part

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.830
of this problem, which
is orienting yourself

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.110
of how you're going to
approach the matrix element.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.470
So to finish up I'll just
give you a little more

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.100
of the answer.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.700
We'll complete the discussion.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.550
We need probably 15 more
minutes to finish it up.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.680
So the only thing
I'm going to say now

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.700
is that if you
look at the notes,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.565
every integral here
is easily doable.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.260
So basically, there's
two integrals.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:48.350
And the way to do them is
first do the r integral.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.560
You will have to
have these terms.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.780
And then do the theta integral.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:59.550
And they are kind of
simple, both of them.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.200
You have to keep up
a lot of constants.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.930
But here is the answer
for the matrix element.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.590
So that part of the integral
I think you all can do.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.720
But you have to take your time.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:23.210
i 32 square root of pi e E0 a0.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.180
I did a lot of work
here, actually,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.720
in writing it in a
comprehensible way

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.330
because it's pretty messy.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:40.850
l cube a0 cube, 1
over 1 plus k squared

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:46.850
a0 squared cube cosine theta.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.115
By now, it starts to
simplify a little.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.160
OK.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.690
That was actually plenty of work
to get it to write it this way.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.220
I feel pretty happy
about that writing.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.600
Why?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.210
First, OK, there
is these numbers.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.350
Nothing I can do about it.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.510
But there's a
multitude of constants

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.520
that I have simplified and
done all kinds of things.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.530
But it was not worth it.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:20.470
First, ka0, that is unit free.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.240
This is unit free.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.490
This is unit free.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.400
k is 1 over length.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.110
ka0 to the 4 is the length cube,
and here is the length cube.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.990
No units here either.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.840
Here, nice units.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.810
This is units of energy.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:41.840
Why?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.930
Electric field times
distance is potential,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:49.660
times electric charge is energy.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.260
Energy.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.630
So this is how this should be.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:59.180
The matrix element of an energy
between normalizable states

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.380
should be an energy.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.270
And that has become clear here.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.620
The next steps that we have to
do, which we'll do next time,

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.120
is to integrate over states, and
put in the density of states,

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.550
and do a little simplification.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.350
But now it's all trivial.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.480
We don't really have
to integrate anymore

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.640
because Fermi's golden
rule did the job for us.

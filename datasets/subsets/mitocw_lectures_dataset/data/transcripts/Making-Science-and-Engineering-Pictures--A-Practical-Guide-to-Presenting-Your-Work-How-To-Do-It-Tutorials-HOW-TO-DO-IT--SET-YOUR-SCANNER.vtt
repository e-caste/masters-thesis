00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:08.350
Let's take a quick look of how
to set your scanner settings.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.622
That is, to set it
for a particular dpi.

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:15.260
So what you do is you
first take a preview.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.640
At least on my scanner, this
is the software that I see.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.970
Yours might be different,
but the idea is the same.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.910
So we get a preview.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.110
This is what my
screen looks like.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.150
And what I decided to do is scan
only this particular portion

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.410
to get final images of
this particular device.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.850
So I did that.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.980
That's how it looks.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.430
And when I press
scan, I am asked

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.920
whether I want to save it.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.330
And I did intend to
save it at 72 dpi.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.040
That's the first scan
that I decided to take.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.550
And then I went through a
whole series of various scans.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.040
And let's look at
them all together.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:12.850
The various scans were 72 dpi;
300; 2,400; up to 6,400 dpi.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.140
And let's see the difference.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.750
Here it is slightly
enlarged, sort

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.580
of trying to keep the same
visuals for you to compare.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.420
I'm starting to see that
the 72 dpi is definitely

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.350
losing clarity.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.940
The others look OK.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.660
And as we increase
the images more so,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.640
we're starting to see
this one breaking down.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.900
And it's starting
to really show up

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.120
as we increase the image size.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.830
So you see as you
increase the resolution,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.560
you get more clarity
in the image.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.479
You're getting more
information for the most part.

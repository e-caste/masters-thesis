MATTHEW VANDER
HEIDEN: Last time, we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.930
discussed standard reduction
potential, this E0 prime value,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.330
that really is a
way to quantitate

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.940
the propensity of a molecule
to accept or donate electrons.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.590
And this is useful to think
about how energy is transduced

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.820
in biological systems.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.390
Because remember, as I have
now tried to stress many times,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.600
how energy is moved
through biology

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
is largely about oxidation
and reduction reactions

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.910
involving carbon and
ultimately oxygen.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.910
And so remember that oxidation
of carbon is favorable.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.460
That is removing
electrons from the carbon

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.250
and giving them to
oxygen, exactly what we

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.550
described for burning
wood or burning gasoline.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.670
And so that's why coming
from the most reduced

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.910
carbon like fatty acids
or other reduced carbon

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.830
like carbohydrates,
not as reduced

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.960
as fatty acids, that oxidizing
that carbon releases energy.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.040
And of course, it means
that storing carbon

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.180
as reduced carbon either as
carbohydrates or fatty acids

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.240
is a way to store
energy for later.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.190
And so moving from left to
right, equilibrium strongly

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.540
favors moving to the right.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.290
That means that delta
G is less than 0

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.030
for the oxidation of carbon.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.260
Or we can describe this
as moving from a smaller

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.040
standard reduction potential
to a larger standard reduction

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.570
potential because, remember, the
relationship between the change

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.790
in standard reduction
potential is related

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.663
to the equilibrium
constant or delta G0 prime,

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.330
which is also related
to the equilibrium

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.360
constant by the above formula.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.230
And so we closed last time by
saying that with this formula

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.960
we know that, if we move from
a smaller standard reduction

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.480
potential-- that is donate
electrons from a smaller

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.870
standard reduction potential
to a larger standard reduction

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
potential-- that that
number, that difference,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.140
will then be positive, which
is the opposite of delta G

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.210
because of that formula.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.010
And so a positive change in
standard reduction potential,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.810
moving from lower to
higher, equilibrium

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.200
is going to favor
that direction--

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
should make sense from
everything we discussed before.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.260
And of course, that
change tells you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.870
the propensity of
electron transfer

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.860
that ultimately is going to
be favorable at equilibrium.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.540
However, exactly as we
discussed for delta G,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.210
whether an exact
reaction is favorable

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.670
is still going to be
dependent on delta G.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.100
And so the change in
standard reduction potential

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.110
tells you about the
equilibrium constant,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.210
and so which direction
is going to be

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.340
net favorable at equilibrium.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.950
However, what actually
happens is still

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.830
going to depend on conditions
for all the reasons

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.310
we talked about previously.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.200
Still, this change in
standard reduction potential

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.800
is still a useful
concept to think about

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.250
because it tells us about
how energy transfer can

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.710
occur across redox pairs.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.410
And that will be
useful in thinking

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.650
about this process of
oxidative phosphorylation

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.840
and how cells really couple
electron transfer to oxygen

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.070
as a way to do lots
of useful things

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.060
in cells, including making ATP.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.840
Now, one point I want
to come back to again,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.670
which we discussed at length
when we talked about changes

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.180
in free energy and how
that worked for pathways,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.590
is that, remember, we discussed
that, if we start with wood

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.610
or oil and all in one
step burn it to CO2,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.279
it releases a certain
amount of energy.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.920
Or we can break that
into individual steps,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.260
as we did in glycolysis.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.030
The same amount of
energy is released.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.620
But by breaking into
individual steps,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.750
we can now capture that
energy as intermediates

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.970
such that we can, say,
favorably synthesize ATP

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.670
at a high ATP/ADP
ratio in cells.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.850
The exact same thing is true
about any of these electron

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.050
transfers.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.870
There is the change in
standard reduction potential.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.580
Or the change in free energy
as one moves from electron

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.670
transfer from one
acceptor to one donor

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.070
is the same if
you go in one step

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.330
or in many different steps.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.350
And so by doing these
stepwise electron transfers

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.060
in exactly the same way we
discussed about for glycolysis,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.050
we can capture that energy
release in smaller packets.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.500
And this is a way to basically
better harness this energy

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.500
release to do useful
things for cells.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.480
Ultimately, you'll see
it's how you make ATP,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.520
but it can do
other work as well,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.760
generate heat, move
ions, et cetera.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.040
And so this is really what
I want to discuss today.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.680
But it's important to remember
these concepts when we think

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.020
through how these systems work.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.320
And so we've now
spent several lectures

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.640
discussing the chemical
details of how we can oxidize.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.360
First, we discussed
carbohydrates.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.520
Then we discussed fatty acids.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.560
And what we saw is that
many of the electrons that

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.740
are lost from the
carbon oxidation

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:02.830
are used to generate molecules
such as NADH or FADH2

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.430
and effectively charge up
a ratio, if you will, of

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.970
reduce oxidized cofactors.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.650
And these molecules then donate
those electrons, ultimately,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.260
to oxygen. And it's that,
how you couple those electron

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.250
transfers from these
carriers to oxygen,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.040
ultimately is what
oxidative phosphorylation is

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.660
about as a way to allow cells
to convert this energy released

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.500
into a biologically useful form.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.360
Now, effectively,
the way biology

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.730
does this is by using that
favorable electron transfer

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.300
to oxygen to charge a battery.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.170
So really oxidative
phosphorylation, if you will,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.690
is about a biological battery.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.670
And it's really
the same concepts

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.830
that you may have
learned in other courses

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.032
about how chemical
batteries work.

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:07.490
And so let's just
think about that.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.200
What is a battery?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.790
Well, a battery is two different
solutions of ions usually

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.960
that is separated
into two compartments.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.070
It has a unit of volts.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.560
That's exactly
what the units are

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.260
for this change in standard
reduction potential is volts.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.850
By using that voltage to run
a current between the two

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.730
compartments, you can do work.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.760
And if you short circuit
a battery, of course,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.920
you can get some heat.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.460
And so how are
these really made?

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.240
Well, you basically just
need to get that voltage.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.570
You need to have something that
insulates between those two

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.140
compartments.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.960
And you can then
control electron flow

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.070
from one side of the
circuit to the other.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.430
And it's exactly the same
issue that happens in biology,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.850
except biology
needs some insulator

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.590
between two compartments.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.170
How do we create different
compartments in cells?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.790
Well, we create
them with membranes.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.100
And so an important function
of membranes in cells,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.850
other than things like
separating cellular contents

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.280
from the outside
world or breaking up

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.220
different organelles,
is that cells actually

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.810
require a membrane.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.320
They're essential
for life because they

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.490
are what allows an insulation
between two aqueous

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.710
compartments in a way
that you can build

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:45.010
a biological battery that is
really central to how life uses

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.630
energy as a way to do work.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.290
And so life creates a voltage,
which I'm going to call delta

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.320
psi, delta pH-- we'll come
back to that in a little bit--

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:06.680
to basically couple favorable
electron transfer from, say,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:15.680
an electron carrier
like NAD/NADH to oxygen,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.200
so reoxidizing NADH to
reduce oxygen to water.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.630
That is moving from a lower
to a higher standard reduction

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.670
potential that's favorable.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.400
Delta G0 prime is negative.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.800
Net transfer is favorable.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.060
This can be coupled to doing
some work that otherwise would

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.210
be unfavorable, in this
case pumping protons

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.850
from one side of the
membrane to another.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.470
By pumping protons to one side
of a membrane or the other,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.610
you create a voltage
membrane potential, often

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.500
abbreviated delta psi.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.020
It's also a pH gradient,
so delta H. The protons

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.440
have lower pH on one side of
the membrane than the other.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.300
And it's this charging of a
battery at a membrane that

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.620
is what is captured by oxidative
phosphorylation, what's

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.480
typically referred to as that
process, as a way to make ATP.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.190
But of course, this
is a useful thing.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.930
It's a battery.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.270
And so it can also do
other work for cells.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.580
Now, I just want
to say and really

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.230
stress that this is really
critical, this process.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.150
And it's really central to
how energy works for cells.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
You will see that,
effectively, this

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.030
is the key steps
in photosynthesis,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.960
do exactly the same thing.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.720
It's how mitochondria work.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.930
It's also how bacteria work.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:03.360
And really prokaryotes end
up doing this at their plasma

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.220
membranes, whereas mitochondria
and chloroplasts end up

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.930
doing this at intracellular
membranes in eukaryotes.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.170
But ultimately,
it's the same idea

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.360
of charging this biological
battery that really allows

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.680
cells to convert, do
energy conversions

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:33.060
in a way that's useful for
them to allow otherwise

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.720
unfavorable things
to happen in cells.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.530
Now, this works
largely because you

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.790
have this insulating
membrane system, which is,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.620
of course, made of lipids.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.160
Lipids are what separates
the two compartments.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.090
Remember, we discussed earlier
that these lipid bilayers

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:59.760
are useful because they
create a hydrophobic interface

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.670
between two aqueous
compartments.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.220
It's also useful
because lipids are

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.380
poor conductors of electrons.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.380
And so this really ends up
being the insulating system

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.370
that makes this work.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.900
Now, in the previous
lecture, we discussed

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.670
a lot about the polar
and non-polar properties

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.090
of phospholipids really
allow them to assemble

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.640
into these membrane barriers.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.160
And I just want to
do a slight diversion

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.950
to revisit this in
the context of how

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.670
this works for bioenergetics.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.050
So remember, you have
this lipid bilayer where

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:59.210
you separate two
aqueous compartments

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.430
with this hydrophobic membrane.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:07.850
In this membrane are
these phospholipids,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:13.160
where you have these polar head
groups with two lipid tails.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.520
You can look back to a
former lecture where I drew

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.670
and we discussed what
those phospholipids

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.380
are in great detail.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.310
But it's really having that
polar, non-polar interface

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.710
that allows you to form
these bilayers that's

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.270
creating this separation between
the aqueous compartments,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:37.100
but also this insulator that
allows a battery to be built

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.160
across the membrane.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.770
Now, there are several
consequences, though,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.000
to this system that is worth
thinking about at least

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.830
in terms of how lipids
and membranes work.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.290
Now, a consequence of
this is that, if we're

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.480
going to create
this system, now we

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.280
create a system where we
have issues with transport

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.400
across from one
compartment to another.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.190
Now, this, of course,
is an opportunity

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.330
for a layer of regulation
because it also

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.980
allows then these
conditions where

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.610
you could have different
chemical conditions,

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.040
say, different ATP/ADP
ratios, NAD/NADH ratios

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.540
in the different compartments,
which, of course,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.930
for all the thermodynamic
reasons we've already discussed

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.260
can make things more or
less favorable to occur

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.930
in different
compartments in cells.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.030
But it also means
metabolism then

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.080
has to have ways to transport
stuff across these membranes.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.240
And we've discussed
this a couple of times.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.160
A few examples--
I talked briefly

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.930
about the pyruvate carrier.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.880
That is, if glycolysis
is happening

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.130
in this compartment
in the cytosol

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.310
and we need to get the pyruvate
inside the mitochondria

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.120
across a membrane for the
pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.300
reaction, now you needed this
pyruvate carrier molecule.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.190
And it turns out that
that transport process

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.200
is an opportunity
for regulation,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.630
but it still needs to occur.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.360
We discussed the
carnitine shuttle, right?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.890
Fatty acid, we generate
fatty acyl-CoAs

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.130
from breakdown of
lipids in one side

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.510
in the cytosolic compartment.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.170
We need to get those fatty
acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.080
where they can be oxidized
by fatty acid oxidation.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.070
And that required that
carnitine shuttle system.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.260
Now, ultimately, what mediates
this transport is, of course,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:40.860
proteins that can sit within
this membrane bilayer.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.690
And you can imagine
you can have proteins

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.880
that span the
membrane bilayer, such

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.400
that there's hydrophilic
surfaces that

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.330
are on either face of the
membrane and hydrophobic

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.940
residues in the middle
with various ways

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.480
to make channels and other
transport mechanisms to get

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.180
things from one side of
the membrane to the other,

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.110
all right?

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.980
Or you could have complexes that
float freely within the lipid

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.670
bilayer, such that there's
a hydrophilic surface that

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.870
faces one compartment and a
hydrophobic surface that faces

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.640
the inside of the membrane.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.850
Now, having these complexes
will become very important

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.710
for ways in which one can
regulate processes that

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.050
occur either within the
membrane or by moving things

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.440
across membranes, like
generating moving protons

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:37.350
and generating a
voltage, or even

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.350
move large things like
proteins across the membrane.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.400
But it has additional
consequences because it now

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.680
means that the properties
of the membrane

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.390
also matter somewhat as well.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.540
And this brings us back
to the other discussion

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.220
we had in the last lecture.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.360
And that is how the various
properties of the fatty acids

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.720
that exist within this
hydrophobic membrane area also,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.569
now, can really
matter because they're

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.930
going to affect things
about how leaky this

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.410
is as an insulator between
the two compartments,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.690
as well as how fluid
the membrane is,

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.119
such that things
like these proteins

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:23.190
can actually move within
this hydrophobic barrier

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.890
between the two compartments.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:39.410
In other words, the fatty
acid composition, as well as

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.700
the lipid species
themselves, that

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:50.930
is which phospholipid, other
polar hydrophobic lipid

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.650
species analogous to
phospholipids that form up

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.000
membranes, can change
properties such as how leaky

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.030
the membrane is or how
fluid the membrane is.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:09.380
You can imagine, if you have a
really rigid membrane surface,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.630
you're not going to get
any flow of materials.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.168
It's not going to be very
leaky, which might be great

00:18:15.168 --> 00:18:17.210
if you want to build an
insulator between the two

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.170
compartments.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.590
But it's going to be very
difficult to regulate transport

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.270
across that compartment.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.990
And so nature has come up with
a bunch of different solutions

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.000
for how to play with fatty acid
and other lipid composition

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.490
to change the
properties of membranes.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.070
We don't have time to get
into that in great detail

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.960
in this course, but I
want you to appreciate

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.880
that these things exist.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.460
But one thing I want to
discuss is that often,

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.610
when you see phospholipids
drawn like this,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.680
they're drawn in this
way where the polar head

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.150
group is a circle.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.660
And then they'll draw the
two lipids tails often

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.030
with a kink in one
of the lipid tails.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.150
That's because many times
phospholipids, of the two lipid

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.460
tails, one is saturated.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.780
And one has a
monounsaturation in it.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.630
And I just want to go
back to the models here.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.570
Remember, the monounsaturated,
the double bond,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.790
ends up being this
cis double bond.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.770
And so here's two fatty acids.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.270
If you put these here in with
the head groups on one side--

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.900
so this would be esterified to
the glycerol, the phospholipid,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.750
you end up getting this
kink in the membrane, which

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.570
is much different than
two straight chains.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.460
You can imagine that
within the membrane

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.680
itself this ends up basically
not letting those lipid tails

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.160
pack quite so tightly in the
membrane, which certainly

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.090
contributes to an
ability to have space

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.670
to put other stuff in
the membrane to allow

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.520
other processes to happen.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.190
Now, recall that
there's other ways

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:01.210
we can modulate the
properties of fatty acids,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.660
introduce more double bonds,
chain length, et cetera.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.550
And different organisms
use different strategies

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.030
to deal with this.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.820
And so plants,
remember, have all kinds

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.920
of polyunsaturated fatty acids,
just like we talked about

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.280
with plant oils being
liquid at room temperature.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.860
Having more polyunsaturated
fatty acids in their lipid

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.030
tails is one way
plants use to keep

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.610
their membranes more fluid.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.690
Animals, remember, have
more saturated fatty acids.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.290
All right, those
saturated fatty acids--

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.190
less double bonds, going
to be higher melting

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.130
temperature, more likely to
be solid at room temperature.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.670
So that's not going to be very
good for membrane fluidity.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.390
And it turns out animals
use a different strategy

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.550
to keep membrane
fluidity that's not

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.680
polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.830
And that is that they
incorporate this molecule shown

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.530
here on the slide,
which is cholesterol,

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.030
which you're well aware of.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.070
And so animals use you
sterols, like cholesterol,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.370
as a way to keep their
membranes more fluid.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.700
And so that cholesterol that
is present in animal products

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.750
is not there to give
you heart attacks.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.320
It's really there
as a way animals use

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.450
to keep their membranes fluid.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.640
And this is really,
at heart, why

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.570
plants are cholesterol
free foods and animals have

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.650
cholesterol.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.530
And it's because animals
use cholesterol as a way

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.870
to keep their membranes
fluid, whereas plants

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.970
use a different strategy,
polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:54.090
All right, now,
ultimately setting up

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.720
the system this way is
important because it allows

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.400
for these flexible
membranes that

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.930
can enable ion and other
transport between compartments,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:10.650
as well as hold a charge so that
you can form this battery which

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.820
allows oxidative phosphorylation
or other processes to occur

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.070
where you can
charge this membrane

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:22.740
and ultimately use that
voltage to do work,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.130
like make ATP, all right?

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:31.450
Now, how this membrane
charging occurs,

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:36.310
again, is really taking
advantage of favorable electron

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:41.110
transfer across a
series of redox pairs,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.970
ultimately, to oxygen or
another good electron acceptor.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.450
And it's really that
favorable electron transfer

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.380
that's being coupled to
this pumping of proton ions

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.570
to charge a battery.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.730
That's the oxidation part.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:04.210
And then that battery doing work
such as driving favorable ADP

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.140
to ATP conversion,
the phosphorylation

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.050
part of oxidative
phosphorylation,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.620
is the type of work
that you can then

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.790
do once you generate this
chemical battery, although not

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.920
the only work you can
do with that battery.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.330
And it's why this
is so much more

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.160
flexible than just making ATP.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.830
All right, so
ultimately this process

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.520
by coupling transfer
of electrons

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.860
from favorable
oxidation of carbon

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.370
to charge up these other
electron carriers that

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:46.740
ultimately transfer to
oxygen is a major way

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:52.350
that life uses nutrient
oxidation to convert it

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.810
to biologically useful energy.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.250
And this is where we get to this
process of what is typically

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:07.530
referred to as oxidative
phosphorylation, which

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:14.850
is a concept or a process that
was often abbreviated oxphos.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:19.350
And it was discovered by or
first described by a gentleman

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.790
by the name of Peter Mitchell.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.150
And like many novel or
revolutionary ideas,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.240
when Peter Mitchell first
described or proposed

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.340
the processes I'm about
to tell you about,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.600
his ideas were
initially dismissed.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.900
It was thought at the time, when
people were thinking about how

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.830
do you couple metabolism to,
say, charge up your ATP/ADP

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.280
ratio, that that
process would work

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.630
via the oxidative
phosphorylation type reactions

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.910
that we otherwise
described, things

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.660
like what happens at the GAPDH
step or the succinic thiokinase

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.760
step in the TCA cycle.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.340
Those are two examples
where we could directly

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:10.820
couple the oxidation of carbon
to a phosphorylation event that

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.540
ultimately allowed us
to favorably produce

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.060
ATP to maintain an
ATP/ADP ratio that's high

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.090
and is present in cells.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.760
However, what Peter
Mitchell described

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.210
was really this
battery phenomena

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.750
that we're talking about.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.500
And it turned out
to be largely right

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.380
and represents something
that's actually

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.610
quite unique about
biological processes

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.250
even if you think about other
biological processes that

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.090
occur.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:50.540
And that is what he
proposed was the oxidation

00:25:50.540 --> 00:26:04.260
and phosphorylation events were
actually separate processes.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:09.330
That is nature does not have
to have these two things touch

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.370
in order for them to work.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.470
That is that you use
oxidation to create

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.780
this battery as one event.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:36.460
So oxidation generates this
potential across a membrane.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.390
And then that potential
across a membrane

00:26:40.390 --> 00:27:02.630
is a totally separate event,
can drive phosphorylation, ATP,

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.090
or do other work,
ultimately making

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.780
this a more flexible
system for biology.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:14.040
And so turns out, as I said
before, in a prokaryotic cell--

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.480
so this here is some
kind of prokaryote, OK?

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.630
Prokaryotes have a membrane
that separates them

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.870
from the outside world.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:30.620
This cell membrane effectively
couples that oxidation step

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.570
to the pumping of protons.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:41.770
That creates a battery
at the cell membrane

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.420
of the prokaryote.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.530
And separate in
space, that can then

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:53.440
be used to drive
ATP synthesis or do

00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.420
other work that's useful to
maintain that prokaryotic cell.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:09.940
Now, in eukaryotes, this
process occurs at membranes

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.180
within the mitochondria.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.890
So this here is a
mitochondria, OK?

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:21.010
So just to remind you of some
very basic cell biology--

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.140
and so, remember, mitochondria
have two membranes.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:35.080
So there's this outer
mitochondrial membrane,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.060
outer mitochondrial membrane.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:44.200
And then there's this inner
mitochondrial membrane,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.930
so two membranes in
the mitochondria.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:52.380
Remember, there's
this matrix space.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.020
The cytosol would be out here.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.250
And then there's this space
between the two membranes

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:14.430
called the intermembrane
space, intermembrane space

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.690
between the two membranes.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.690
If you'll recall, many of these
oxidation reactions, the TCA

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.760
cycle, fatty acid oxidation,
pyruvate dehydrogenase step,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.840
all of those were happening in
the matrix of the mitochondria.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.390
Remember, glycolysis
was in the cytosol,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.460
but all these other
processes were

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.830
happening in the matrix
of the mitochondria.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.940
And really what's going
on is that this battery is

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.920
being charged across this inner
mitochondrial membrane, OK?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.550
So protons are being pumped
into the inner mitochondrial

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:55.680
membrane into the intermembrane
space of the mitochondria

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.170
and then used to synthesize
ATP in the matrix

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.090
of the mitochondria.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:07.050
Now, part of this came,
many people know-- remember,

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.640
mitochondria have their
own DNA, et cetera.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.540
And so really where
people thought,

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.900
think eukaryotic cells
came from is basically

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.060
the mitochondria is an enslaved
bacteria or an obligate

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:26.040
captured symbiont, if you
will, where one cell engulfed

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.480
a different prokaryotic cell.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.610
And if you track this, think
of the inner mitochondrial

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:39.290
membrane as a enslaved
prokaryotic cell,

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.090
you can see that
you're generating

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:51.440
this membrane potential
across the inner mitochondrial

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.660
membrane, which is
really equivalent

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:59.330
to the bacterial membrane of
the enslaved prokaryotic cell.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.990
In both cases, it's
creating this battery

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.540
at a membrane, the inner
mitochondrial membrane

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.630
or the bacterial membrane of
a prokaryote, that is then

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:12.830
being used to
separately in space

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.360
use that gradient to do
work, such as synthesize ATP.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:29.250
So if I draw this more
explicitly as this here

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.090
being the membrane--

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.960
so the inner
mitochondrial membrane

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:45.600
of a mitochondria or
the bacterial membrane

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.090
of a prokaryotic
cell, such that this

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.970
is outside the bacteria,
that's inside the bacteria.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.100
This is the intermembrane
space often referred to

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.590
as the cytosol side.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.860
Of course, there's another outer
mitochondrial membrane here

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.390
that, for the sake
of this class,

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.570
you can just think of as
being generally permeable.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.860
This would be the matrix inside
of the inner mitochondrial

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.980
membrane.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:19.320
And so all this NADH
is being generated

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.380
from nutrient
oxidation TCA cycle,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.690
fatty acid oxidation,
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.020
whatever, within the matrix
or within the bacteria.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:39.360
Those electrons are ultimately
being transferred from NADH,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:45.730
reoxidizing it to NAD, to
reduce oxygen to water.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.370
This is favorable.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:55.210
This is, therefore,
coupled to pumping protons.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:04.860
That creates a membrane
potential and gradient

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.030
across this membrane,
which can be

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:22.940
used to do work such as
driving the synthesis of ATP

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.570
for other work.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.570
So this all has to happen
at the same membrane,

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.360
but this process does not
have to touch that process.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.660
It's coupled because
you create this battery,

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:42.180
this membrane potential
and pH gradient, that

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.570
can be used elsewhere
along the membrane

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.860
to do some kind of work.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.340
Now, I draw this is
delta psi, delta pH.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.750
You can imagine, if
you're moving protons,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.420
you're going to
create a voltage.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.972
You're also going to
create a pH gradient.

00:33:58.972 --> 00:34:00.680
It turns out I don't
have time to discuss

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.763
this further in the class.

00:34:01.763 --> 00:34:04.070
A lot is written
about how to think

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:09.320
about this membrane potential
as either a true voltage

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.940
or as a pH gradient.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.889
It turns out that
they're useful to think

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.784
about in different ways
for different processes.

00:34:15.784 --> 00:34:17.159
But if you're
interested in this,

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.290
there's certainly lots written
about this on various papers

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.389
and texts on bioenergetics.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.880
And I would encourage you
to read more about that.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.135
OK.

00:34:28.135 --> 00:34:29.510
All right, what
I want to do next

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.540
then is discuss each
of these processes

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.850
in turn, that is
how does this work

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:41.020
and how does that work,
to really understand

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.739
what's going on in
mitochondria and bacteria

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.370
to carry out this process of
oxidative phosphorylation.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.280
So first, let's talk here.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:35:06.190
First, how does one use
favorable electron transfer

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:16.590
to make this membrane potential?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.860
Obviously, if we're
going to pump protons

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.780
against a gradient, such that
we have different concentration

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.790
of protons on either
side of the membrane,

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.430
that's going to
require energy input.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.340
And that energy is going to
come from favorable electron

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:33.840
transfer.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:49.490
And really this process is
taking electrons from, say,

00:35:49.490 --> 00:36:00.130
a cofactor like NADH, and
ultimately transferring

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:05.180
those electrons to
oxygen to get water.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.320
The standard reduction
potential of NAD/NADH

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.020
is less than the
standard reduction

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.240
potential of oxygen and water.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.020
That means that equilibrium
is going to favor electron

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.420
transport in this direction.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.170
To say it another way,
relative to oxygen-water,

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.130
NAD/NADH is a better
electron donor.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.480
Oxygen-water is a better
electron acceptor pair.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.460
And so by this electron
transfer being favorable,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.770
it can be used then
to release energy

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.760
coupled to other processes,
such as moving protons

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.530
and make that otherwise
unfavorable process favorable.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.130
Now, you'll note
that, in doing this,

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.510
we now regenerate the
oxidized cofactor NAD+.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:05.000
And so that solves our electron
balance problem for glycolysis,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.910
solves any electron
balance problem

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:12.380
that would exist for fatty
acid oxidation or the TCA cycle

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.850
in the mitochondria.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.620
Because ultimately,
those electrons

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.800
are being given to
oxygen. And so oxygen,

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.030
being this final
electron acceptor,

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:26.620
being stoichiometrically
produced to generate water,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.550
is effectively water being
the alternative waste product

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.620
to, say, lactate
or ethanol that we

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.520
saw in fermentation, all right?

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.280
Now, as we started the
lecture with and discussed

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.120
in glycolysis, if we do this
in one step, it's favorable.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.610
But it's also favorable if we
do it in lots of little steps.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.570
By doing it and lots
of little steps,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.810
just like we did
in glycolysis, we

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.180
can break up that
energy release in a way

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.060
to allow us to do
more work, right?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:04.680
So in glycolysis, we could
turn carbohydrate into CO2--

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.920
one step, burning wood,
release a lot of light and heat

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.510
all in one step.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.100
That can be used to do work.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.100
But it was more efficient to
break it up into little steps

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.900
where we could then
capture intermediates

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.850
that made ATP synthase favorable
despite high ATP/ADP ratio.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.300
Same idea here, we could
transfer this all in one step.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.370
But instead, you break
it up into a bunch

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:31.050
of individual steps, which can
then be coupled individually

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.490
to pumping protons
across the membrane

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:37.980
to generate more efficiently
this delta PSI delta pH

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.260
to charge this battery.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:46.620
And so this occurs across a
series of electron carriers,

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.860
multi-protein complexes,
electron carriers,

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.650
called the electron
transport chain.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.470
And you can think of this
electron transport chain

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.320
as being entirely analogous
to what we already

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.660
talked about when
we talked about how

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.090
pyruvate dehydrogenase
or alpha-ketoglutarate

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.330
dehydrogenase works when we
talked about the TCA cycle.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.480
Remember, these had these
different protein complexes,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.420
this E1, E2, E3,
where electrons were

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.250
transferred across this chain.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.010
It's exactly the same
idea here, a number

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:24.900
of multi-polypeptide
encoded protein complexes

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.760
that come together to hold
a bunch of electron carriers

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.400
that break up the energy
release, if you will,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.880
as we oxidize NADH and
reduce oxygen and transfer

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.440
those electrons along the chain
with the complexes themselves

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.040
coupling the favorable
electron transfer to the moving

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:52.040
of protons against a gradient
across the membrane to work.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.700
And so for this electron
transport chain to work,

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.000
we obviously need a bunch
of electron carriers.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.220
And why you need more
than one electron carrier

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.750
should now be obvious.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.270
Because having
different carriers that

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.150
sit at different
standard reduction

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:12.380
potentials is going
to be useful if we

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:18.260
want to build a chain such that
we can have favorable oxidation

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.800
and reduction to move electrons
in a favorable direction

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.210
and couple that to
processes that allow

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.970
us to charge this battery.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.820
And so it turns out that
for this electron transport

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.200
chain to work--

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.670
well, we know about some
of our electron carriers.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.890
So we've discussed NAD, NADH.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.270
There's FAD, FADH2.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.470
There was lipoic acid.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:53.460
Lipoic acid is not part of
the electron transport chain.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.890
NAD, NADH is a donor.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.090
You'll see FAD can be part of
the electron transport chain,

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.740
but there's a different--

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.510
or there's additional
electron carriers.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.160
I want to discuss those now.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.970
So another important
one is something called

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:13.606
FMN or Flavin Mononucleotide.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:21.360
What FMN, or Flavin
Mononucleotide is, is it's

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.270
effectively FAD.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.750
But it's a FAD not in
a dinucleotide state,

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.950
but a mononucleotide state.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.630
So if you take FAD and you
remove an AMP group from it,

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.420
what you're left with is FMN.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.465
So just to remind you to
be explicit about this--

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:40.965
so.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:36.050
So you have this flavin group
attached to this ribitol group

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.550
with a phosphate on it.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.670
If I put another phosphate and
an adenine nucleotide here,

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.150
an AMP group attached
here, that would be FAD.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:49.040
This would be FMN, nucleotide
instead of a dinucleotide.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:55.460
This is FMN in
the oxidized form.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:03.530
And just like FAD, it can
accept an electron pair.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:08.675
So here's our hydride
ion, two electrons

00:43:08.675 --> 00:43:12.180
if we just draw here the
middle part of the molecule.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:37.410
And so this here would be
FMNH2 or the reduced form

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:42.440
of this electron carrier, OK?

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:47.320
So flavin mononucleotide--
part of the electron transport

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.260
chain.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.690
Now, note FMN, FAD,
NAD, all of these things

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.120
are two electron
carriers, right?

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.820
We disguise the
mechanism of all of them,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.220
just reminded you of
it, these hydride ion

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.780
transfers, two
electron carriers.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.920
It turns out the electron
transport chain also

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.130
uses metal ions as
electron carriers.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.820
And so-- lots of minerals in
our diet, things like iron.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.240
It turns out elemental iron
is a great electron carrier.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.320
And it's very important for
electron transport chain.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.770
Now, elemental metals
are one electron carrier.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.490
And so there's a few ways
you incorporate iron.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.940
One is something called
iron sulfur clusters.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.110
And so iron sulfur clusters
is, within a protein,

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.580
you have some cysteine residues.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:49.170
And those cysteine residues
can coordinate an iron atom.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:57.410
And so that iron atom can sit
in the 3+ versus 2+ state,

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:58.745
oxidized, reduced.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.780
So reduction of the iron--

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.780
oxidation of the iron, OK?

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.640
So one electron carrier--

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.740
move one electron that way.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:19.090
Also, ion sits within
molecules called cytochromes.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.070
So what are cytochromes?

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.940
This is an iron atom
that's basically

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.480
chelated into a porphyrin
very similar to what

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.530
you saw for hemoglobin.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:54.870
And so you have an iron 2+ or 3+
that's chelated here into this

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.140
porphyrin ring structure.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.040
OK.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.560
Lots of conjugated double
bond systems in it,

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.410
this should look very similar.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.940
Porphyrin is the thing on
the outside, coordinates iron

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.020
atom in the middle.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.900
That can move between the 2+
and the 3+ state just like we do

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.320
for iron sulfur clusters, so
carry electrons be oxidized

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.110
or reduced, 3+ or 2+.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:32.750
And ultimately,
this porphyrin can

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:40.930
have some R groups added here,
can be associated with it

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:44.560
or bound to cysteine
residues within proteins.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.480
Effectively, these molecules
varying these R groups

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.970
and how it's
attached to proteins

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:56.020
gives you different families
of cytochrome is referred

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:04.720
to as cytochrome A, the B type
cytochromes, and cytochrome C.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.720
These are associated
with enzyme complexes,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.090
cytochrome C. It's
actually covalently bound

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.630
to the polypeptide itself.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.790
Basically, these are
named because you

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:21.560
have these different conjugated
ring structures here.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.770
That and how the R groups
are will slightly change.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.300
So this will absorb
visible light.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.640
That will slightly change
the absorption spectra.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.120
And so classically, based
on absorption spectra,

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.810
these were classified into
A, B, and C type cytochromes.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.850
And you can imagine,
by these properties

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.640
having slightly different--

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.650
affecting the iron in
ways that it slightly

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.620
affects its electron
transport properties.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.440
Of course, hemoglobin
almost certainly

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.550
evolved from these molecules
as oxygen carrying ways

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.350
in multicellular life.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:58.195
But of course, the original
use was as electron carriers

00:47:58.195 --> 00:47:59.570
for the processes
here that we're

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.700
going to talk about, to
hold that iron as a way

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.170
to control electron transport
across these electron transport

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.700
chains.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.810
All right, so that's iron.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.840
It turns out iron is
not the only metal that

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.530
can be used to do this.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:16.640
And so cells also use copper.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:32.400
And so histidine can coordinate
a copper that can move between

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.210
an oxidized and reduced state,
so copper 2+ reduced to copper

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:41.490
+, copper + to copper 2+ or
copper + oxidized to copper 2+,

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:44.250
another one electron carrier.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.137
And so iron and copper can
act as one electron carriers.

00:48:49.137 --> 00:48:50.970
And so you have these
two electron carriers.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.640
Here's a bunch of metals
as one electron carriers.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.875
Obviously, you need ways
to carry both one and two

00:48:57.875 --> 00:48:59.250
electrons if you're
going to move

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.190
electrons between these
different carriers.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:05.700
And an important molecule
to do that is something

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:12.160
called coenzyme Q. Coenzyme Q--

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:22.030
sometimes referred to
as ubiquinone ubiquinol,

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:29.198
because it's ubiquitous, often
abbreviated co-Q. Many of you

00:49:29.198 --> 00:49:30.740
have probably heard
of the supplement

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.910
CoQ10, very popular
supplement out there.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:38.840
CoQ10 is basically a
version of coenzyme Q,

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.970
ubiquinone, ubiquinol.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.620
What this looks
like is as follows.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:12.470
So this here is ubiquinone,
the oxidized form.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.860
So this middle part
is the quinone.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.710
And then you have these
decorations on the outside,

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.240
including this R group.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.390
This R group is typically
a long acyl tail.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:27.530
If it's 10 carbons long,
that's CoQ10 supplement.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.810
Having this long
acyl chain makes this

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.520
a very hydrophobic molecule.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.540
And it actually lives
within the membrane itself

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.310
as an electron carrier.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:45.955
And so this ubiquinone can
pick up an electron as well as

00:50:45.955 --> 00:50:46.455
a proton.

00:50:49.192 --> 00:50:49.692
Whoops.

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:04.280
And so by picking
up one electron,

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:25.110
it can then basically go here
to this semiquinone stabilized

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.570
free radical state
and then pick up

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:34.535
a second electron to go
to the fully reduced form.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:46.180
ubiquinol.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.080
OK.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.800
So one electronic carrier
and two electron carrier--

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.850
so basically, it can
carry two electrons

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.710
from the oxidized,
the reduced form,

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.010
but can transfer them
as single electrons

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:11.250
by going through this stabilized
free radical ubiquinone state.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:14.400
And so, basically, these
various electron carriers

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.810
are associated with
these protein complexes

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:22.740
within this electron transport
chain that ultimately works

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.340
to couple favorable
electron transport down

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.660
the chain to pumping protons
to generate this potential

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.330
across the membrane.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:47.920
All right, so this
process occurs, again,

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.850
at the bacterial membrane or
the inner mitochondrial membrane

00:52:51.850 --> 00:53:01.340
and, in animals
and most organisms,

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:10.490
operates with four large
multi-subunit protein

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.340
complexes, all right?

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:19.940
Each of these protein complexes
has multiple polypeptides,

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:20.440
as I said.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.910
It's coming together to form
these complexes just like we

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.400
described for pH, for instance.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.680
Most of the
components of this are

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.160
encoded in the nuclear
genome, but a subset of these

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.500
are encoded in the
mitochondrial genome.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.680
Now, what exactly is encoded in
different mitochondrial genomes

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.690
varies by organisms.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.960
But across organisms,
it's basically

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:47.210
mostly complex components
of these protein complexes.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.790
And so this is why
mitochondrial DNA is retained.

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.150
It's kind of this vestige of
this symbiotic relationship.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.030
The mitochondria have
retained some of the ability

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.525
to control their own
energy transduction, sort

00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:02.510
of core components
of these complexes.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:06.020
There is one soluble protein.

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:09.410
So these complexes are
embedded within the membrane.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.320
There's also one
soluble protein that's

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.030
associated with the membrane.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:19.190
And then there's
coenzyme Q, which also

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.460
floats within the membrane.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.600
So that's in the membrane.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.172
These are embedded
in the membrane.

00:54:29.172 --> 00:54:30.880
And then there's a
soluble protein that's

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.410
associated with the membrane.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:15.650
OK, now I want to discuss the
details of what these protein

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:23.790
complexes are and also few
comments about how they work.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:26.150
So if this is the
inner membrane space

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.160
and this is the
matrix side, that'd

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:34.460
be out or in if we're
discussing a prokaryote.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:53.260
The first is we have something
called complex I, also

00:55:53.260 --> 00:56:06.595
referred to as NADH oxidase
because it oxidizes NADH back

00:56:06.595 --> 00:56:07.095
to NAD.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:20.020
NADH oxidase is a giant complex
greater than 900 kilodaltons

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.115
in total.

00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:31.230
It has more than 25
individual protein subunits,

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:37.410
contains some flavin
mononucleotides as well as

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:42.750
some iron sulfur clusters
as electron carriers.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:47.370
And it is the least
well-understood

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.050
of all of the protein complexes.

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:53.520
In fact, it is still
a major field of study

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.930
to try to understand how
NAD oxidase really works.

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:03.120
But it effectively is one of the
complexes that can pump protons

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.770
across the membrane as those
two electrons are transferred

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:17.070
through the complex from NADH
ultimately to coenzyme Q that

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.720
exists within the membrane.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:34.010
OK, the next complex
discuss is complex II.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:44.440
Complex II is succinate
dehydrogenase, the exact enzyme

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.830
that we heard about
from the TCA cycle.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.520
So what does succinate
dehydrogenase do?

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.760
Remember, it converts
fumarate to succinate.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:04.200
It gave those electrons
to FAD to make FADH2.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.420
Well, that occurs
within this complex,

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:14.010
which can also reoxidize the
FADH2 with those two electrons

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:18.540
and give them,
also, to coenzyme Q

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.790
that sits within the membrane.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:27.810
So I want to point out that
this, ultimately, you will see,

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:34.530
is why it is that electron
transfer from NADH and FADH2

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:37.800
has different energy yields.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:44.250
And so the electron transfer
from NADH to ubiquinone

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:48.030
is more of a change in
standard reduction potential

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:51.450
than from FADH2 to ubiquinone.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:53.460
Why use FADH2?

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.030
Well, because, remember when
we did electron transfers,

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:05.370
we used, when we
oxidized a carbon, say,

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:15.360
in a carbohydrate to a ketone,
we tended to use NAD+/NADH

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.990
as the electron transport pair.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.240
So this change in
standard reduction

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:26.160
potential is such that we
can make that reaction work

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.140
and ultimately drive that.

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:34.320
It turns out that putting
a double bond in--

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:40.410
this going from a not oxidizing
an alcohol to a ketone,

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:43.380
but oxidizing the carbon
to a double bond--

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:50.510
that basically you
need a different change

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:55.040
in standard reduction potential
to carry out that reaction

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.140
and make it work.

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.670
FADH/FADH2 sits at a
higher standard reduction

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:04.580
potential than NAD/NADH.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.090
And so that means to
further transfer them

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:14.678
to something further
downstream, like coenzyme Q,

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.970
there's a bigger change in
standard reduction potential

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:17.470
here.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.130
That can be used
to drive protons.

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.840
There's not enough
of a change here.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.120
You can't use that
to drive protons.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.400
And it's because of
these differences

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.360
in what's actually being
oxidized that ultimately leads

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.750
to this difference in energetics
when we think about FADH2

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:39.800
versus NADH and how
much ATP equivalence

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.280
that they might have for cells.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:49.850
All right, once electrons
are in the ubiquinone pool

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:57.980
or coenzyme Q pool, they can now
be transferred to complex III.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:11.840
So complex III is also referred
to as cytochrome C reductase.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.240
You'll see why in a second.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.910
It's a 250 kilodalton complex.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.810
There are 10 subunits.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:35.720
It has a bunch of B type
and C type cytochromes,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.890
as well as some iron
sulfur clusters.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.590
Shown here on the
slide from a textbook

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:50.730
is a picture of complex III and
what it actually looks like.

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:54.330
Fairly well-understood
how it works,

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:58.440
this coupling of basically
electron transfer through the Q

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.825
pool can pump protons.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:08.940
And this ultimately
allows transfer

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:15.060
of electrons to this
small soluble protein that

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.600
lives in the intermembrane space
or associated with the outside

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.050
of the bacteria
called cytochrome C--

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:25.650
or outside in the intermembrane
space called cytochrome C.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:34.840
Cytochrome C is a 13
kilodalton protein.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.520
It's a very small
highly conserved protein

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.273
with a C type
cytochrome commonly used

01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:43.440
because it's found across
many, many different types

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.170
of organisms.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:47.430
And so it's been sequenced
from many, many organisms

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.550
as a way to identify
evolutionary relationships.

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.590
And then cytochrome
C, this is also

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.410
why it's called cytochrome
C reductase because it's

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:59.640
reducing cytochrome C
to transfer electrons

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:07.200
along the chain, ultimately to
the final complex, complex IV.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:14.580
Complex IV-- also referred
to as cytochrome C oxidase.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:20.790
And this is ultimately the place
where electrons are transferred

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.700
to reduce oxygen to water.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:30.300
So this is 160 kilodalton
protein complex

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:45.970
with 13 subunits, uses A
type cytochromes and copper

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:50.710
as electron carriers
and, ultimately,

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:55.150
allows you to get electrons
from cytochrome C to oxygen.

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:57.340
And so here, again,
from the textbook

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:03.190
is a picture of complex
IV and what it looks like.

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:08.590
Also, fairly well-understood--
also couples electron transport

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:12.140
to proton pumping.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:18.050
And so this is effectively
the electron transport chain

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.000
as it exists in mitochondria.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.650
And you can draw it a different
way as I will do here.

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:35.710
So here's complex I, allows
oxidation of NADH back to NAD+.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:48.480
That oxidation can be
coupled to reduction of FMN.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:05:03.500
Ultimately, those are passed
through some iron sulfur

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:12.620
clusters leading to the
reduction of ubiquinone.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:17.660
And in the process,
this electron transport

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:20.720
can pump on the order
of four protons,

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.150
or at least that's
what's estimated.

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:29.510
Complex II, which is succinate
dehydrogenase from the TCA

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:37.900
cycle, really converts
succinate to fumarate.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:44.980
That oxidation reaction
within the complex

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.600
leads to the reduction
of FAD to FADH2.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:06:00.170
That can be reoxidized
through iron,

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:08.710
ultimately driving the
reduction of coenzyme Q

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.440
from ubiquinone to ubiquinol.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.760
That ubiquinone to you
ubiquinol in something

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.960
called the Q pool
within the membrane

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:32.310
can then be reoxidized
in complex III.

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:38.670
That reoxidized in
complex III puts electrons

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:42.570
through complex III that
can be coupled to pumping

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:45.930
on the order of two protons.

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:52.020
Those electrons are transferred
to cytochrome C. Ultimately,

01:06:52.020 --> 01:07:00.800
those electrons are transferred
to copper in complex IV

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:08.840
to cytochrome A and,
ultimately, oxygen to water,

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.070
reducing oxygen to
water and pumping

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:16.270
on the order of four protons.

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:22.390
And so you can see here
that, basically, this

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.920
is a series of oxidation
and reduction reactions

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.260
that happens across these
complexes, such that complex I,

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.170
the transfer electrons from
the Q pool through complex III.

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:40.000
And complex IV can pump
protons across the membrane

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.400
and generate this
delta psi delta

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.980
pH that can be used to do work.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.680
And it's really the favorable
transfer of electrons

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.580
either from NAD/NADH or the
oxidation of the succinate

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:56.200
to fumarate with those electrons
being given to oxygen to drive

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.460
this process.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:08.040
And so really just to schematize
this, in a way, is that,

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:19.080
if this is our membrane, NAD+ to
NADH gives electrons to complex

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:24.660
I, which goes to coenzyme Q,
which goes to complex III,

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.830
which goes to cytochrome
C, which goes to complex IV

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:34.319
and reduces oxygen to water.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:38.250
That is one way to carry
out this set of reactions.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:43.295
The other way is we
can convert fumarate--

01:08:43.295 --> 01:08:48.630
sorry, succinate to fumarate.

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.520
That's the FAD.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.390
That's complex II, also
gives it to the Q pool.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.790
And so you can see that
the electron transport

01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:02.790
chain would be complex I, Q,
III C, IV or II Q, III, C IV.

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:05.160
It is not I, II, III, IV.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:11.766
It is actually I to Q or II
to Q, ultimately going to III.

01:09:11.766 --> 01:09:15.870
Now, the way protons
are pumped is a process

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:19.290
that I don't have time this
year to discuss in class.

01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.810
I will post something
on Stellar that is just

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:24.990
a short section from the
textbook that describes

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:28.859
at least what is known about
how that process works,

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:33.000
such as the Q cycle,
basically how oxidation

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.050
and reduction of coenzyme
Q, which will take protons

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.660
on and off the molecule on
either side of the membrane,

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:44.340
can be used to show how this
can be coupled to proton

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.200
pumping across the membrane.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.170
And you can read that
if you're interested.

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.760
OK.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:58.890
Now, a couple other
points about this, this

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:05.450
works because you're
moving from a lower

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:08.810
to a higher standard reduction
potential across the chain.

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:13.340
And it turns out oxygen is
a particularly good electron

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.540
acceptor.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.320
And this is really why oxygen
and respiration is really

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.280
so vital to a lot of the
way energy transduction

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.140
works in metabolism.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.760
Oxygen is now abundant.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.260
And being a great electron
acceptor is why it's used.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.200
But of course, oxygen
was not abundant

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.600
2 and 1/2 billion years ago.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.200
And it doesn't have to be
oxygen for this to work.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.220
If you have another
electron acceptor that

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.980
basically makes this
process favorable,

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.520
that can work just as well.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.500
And in fact, that happens
still in some very extreme

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.670
environments.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:52.610
This so-called
chemosynthesis basically

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:56.210
can use other
electronic acceptors

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.300
to drive the
energetics of cells.

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:04.060
And you really just
need the right ways

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.720
to build an electron transport
chain to make this whole system

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:11.150
work, such you can build a
battery and use it to do work,

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:11.650
OK?

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:15.070
So oxygen-- commonly used
because it's abundant and good

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:18.250
at it, but it's not the
only way that this can work.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.810
And there are
examples in biology

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.830
where oxygen is not used, that
there is other acceptors that

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.980
are used instead.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.430
Now, I also want to note, as
I've alluded to in discussing

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:33.570
complex II, this FAD/FADH2.

01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:37.260
So when we talk about
that in the TCA cycle

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.350
or in fatty acid
oxidation, we discuss it

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.040
as if it's kind of like
NAD/NADH, but it's not.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.330
NAD/NADH are basically
cofactors that

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:50.100
move around between enzymes.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.930
Fad/fadh2 are not free.

01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:59.490
They're electron carriers that
are part of protein complexes,

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:03.000
like what we described up here.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.970
And they're part of enzymes
like succinate dehydrogenase.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:13.170
So complex II just happens to be
an FAD/FADH2 containing enzyme

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.980
that's part of the TCA cycle and
part of the electron transport

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.880
chain as a way to transfer
electrons in the TCA cycle

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.790
into the Q pool
via this succinate

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.000
to fumarate conversion.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.660
Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
the FAD/FADH2 enzyme

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.030
we discussed in
fatty acid oxidation,

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:37.020
could easily be drawn instead
in electron transport chain that

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.850
goes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
coenzyme Q, III, C, IV,

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.860
just like we can say
succinate to fumarate

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.880
is the same as complex
II, Q, III, C, IV, OK?

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.540
And so there's really lots of
alternative electron transport

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.830
chains that involve these
FAD/FADH2 containing enzymes

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:59.850
that really sit in the membrane
and directly transfer electrons

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:03.780
to the Q pool.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.420
Ultimately, the
goal of all of this

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.260
is, of course, to create
this delta psi delta

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:14.790
pH, which can be used to charge
this battery that then can then

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.840
be done to do work.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:22.110
And so this work includes
the phosphorylation of ATP.

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:25.200
And so if we charge
this battery,

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:36.250
we can now use this as a way to
couple current in this battery

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:41.680
to phosphorylate ADP to make
ATP, the phosphorylation part

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.830
of oxidative phosphorylation.

01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:48.730
Now, this occurs also by a
large protein complex sometimes

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:52.210
referred to as complex
V. But remember,

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.690
complex V, or this ATP
synthase machinery,

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:58.720
is not really part of the
electron transport chain.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.890
It is separate in space and
is basically something, a way,

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:07.450
to utilize this delta psi
delta pH across the membrane

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:11.590
to drive ATP synthesis.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:19.190
All right, how does this
complex V or ATP synthesis work?

01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:29.200
So this is also a
large protein complex,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.300
sits within the same
membrane, of course,

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:36.640
because it has to utilize the
membrane potential to function.

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:58.930
And the so-called
complex V is also

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:12.750
referred to as the ATP
synthase or the F0 F1 ATPase.

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:19.190
And basically, if this is
the intermembrane space,

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:22.650
this is the inner
mitochondrial membrane.

01:15:22.650 --> 01:15:25.240
This is the matrix.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.360
You have a protein
complex that sits

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.590
within the membrane called F0.

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:35.420
It's actually FO.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.470
The O stands for a
Oligomycin because there's

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:42.470
a drug called oligomycin
that inhibits the FO,

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:46.250
or F0, part of the molecule.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.700
And then there's
this F1 component

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.760
that is associated with
the F0 component that

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.950
sits on the matrix
side of the membrane.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:58.250
And it is effectively
the machine

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:04.830
that phosphorylates
or interconverts

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:11.080
ATP and ADP on the matrix
side of the membrane.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:15.100
Now, it's pretty well-understood
how this system works.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.790
And basically, F1
works by a process

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:21.360
called rotational catalysis.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.870
How this works was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 1997,

01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:27.930
figured out not
all that long ago.

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:32.760
And basically, this is F1 is
a large protein complex where

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.480
you have a gamma
subunit that is attached

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.520
to F0 the couples, basically,
proton pumping to this gamma

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.860
subunit to literally
turn the F1 component

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:53.040
and change the confirmation
of attached regions, parts,

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.830
of this F1 machine.

01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:57.270
Because it turns
out you can have

01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:01.050
three different conformations
of the rest of F1,

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.380
the so-called L, or Loose,
conformation, the T,

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:09.480
or Tight, conformation, or
the O, or Open, conformation.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:24.290
And so in the open conformation,
ADP and phosphate or ATP

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:30.880
can exchange in and out of
this complex, all right?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.720
In the loose confirmation,
you basically

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.500
have ADP and phosphate bound.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:43.630
And in the tight
conformation, this

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:49.900
is favored to synthesize ATP.

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:55.510
And so you can envision that
what actually happens here

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:59.980
is that you first
have ADP and ATP

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.840
bind in this open conformation.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.650
Protons are moved.

01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:16.680
You get rotation around
the gamma subunit.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.610
That changes the
conformation of the O subunit

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:21.960
to the loose subunit.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.040
So now, you have
ADP plus PI bound.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.870
Another proton moves,
changes the conformation

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:36.030
of the loose subunit into
the tight confirmation.

01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:40.800
Now, ATP synthase is favored.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.920
Another proton moves, comes
back to the open conformation.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.620
ATP is released
from the molecule,

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.920
and you can run another
rotational catalysis cycle

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.740
again to ultimately drive
ATP to ATP synthase using

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:03.750
this transfer of protons
across the F0 subunit

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:10.160
to ultimately rotate this
machine to synthesize ATP.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.210
Now, the way F0 works
is within the membrane--

01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.140
and this is always
hard to draw--

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:32.120
you basically have
a central complex

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.700
with another set of
complexes around it

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:38.930
that, within that, have
two half-channels that

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:42.780
are open to either
side of the membrane.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.780
And so if you look at
this from the top view,

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.990
so looking at it
straight down, you'd

01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:52.400
have this central piece
with this external piece

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:58.010
with the two half-channels that
basically can rotate around

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.540
the central stalk.

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.750
This is hooked up to
the gamma subunit of F1

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.690
in which drives
rotational catalysis.

01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:07.700
And how this works
is that attached

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:13.220
to this inner piece that is
open to the half-channels

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.070
is an aspartate residue.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:21.350
So this is an aspartic
acid residue that's there.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:26.810
And recall that aspartic
acid, it's an acid.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:33.060
So it can pick up a
proton or release a proton

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.590
from its acid group
depending on the pH

01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:39.520
on either side of the membrane.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.030
And so, remember,
there's a different pH

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:46.180
on the two sides
of the membrane.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:50.550
And it's really that
difference in pH

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:56.640
that will allow favorable
turning around this center

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.710
stalk.

01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.130
And so the pH in the
intermembrane space is lower.

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:05.160
So that means you're
more likely to favor

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.530
protonation of the aspartate.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.920
It can then rotate, such as the
channel, that aspartate, is now

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.590
exposed to the other
channel, to the matrix side.

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:17.400
There, the pH is higher,
so favors deprotonation.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:22.560
And basically, this will
drive motion of this piece

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.270
around the central stalk.

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:28.220
That being coupled to
the gamma subunit of F1

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:33.510
will cause the rotation
of the F1 subunit changing

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:37.890
the attached conformation of
the rest of the complex to favor

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:39.420
ATP synthesis.

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:44.670
And it's really this is
how moving of protons back

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:47.070
from the intermembrane
space to the matrix

01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:50.580
can drive the synthesis of
ATP, the phosphorylation

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:54.220
part of this process.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:56.280
And so now you
have a full picture

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.570
of how carbon oxidation really
releases energy in a way that's

01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:03.900
coupled to do work in biology.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.120
So we can, of course,
couple this directly,

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.050
as we did at GAPDH or
succinic thiokinase.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:15.630
But mostly, it's captured to
charge up these NAD/NADH ratios

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:18.120
where favorable
electron transport can

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.990
be used to make this delta psi
delta pH in a membrane that

01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:26.280
can be used also to synthesize
ATP despite a high ATP/ADP

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:34.740
ratio because that battery can
be used to drive this machine.

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.740
Now, I want to point out
that the ATP synthase is just

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.870
like any other enzyme
in any pathway.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:42.690
And that is, if
conditions are right,

01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:45.090
there's no reason
that this machine

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.160
has to drive ATP synthesis.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.880
It could also
consume ATP as a way

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.400
to create a proton gradient.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.450
That is use ATP
hydrolysis to pump

01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:59.670
protons in the
opposite direction

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.835
into the intermembrane space.

01:23:01.835 --> 01:23:03.210
Well, why would
you ever do that?

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:06.030
Well, you would do that
because having this battery

01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:09.960
is useful because ATP is
not the only way that cells

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.940
can use energy to do work.

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.790
It turns out that having
a membrane potential

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:16.070
is useful for other things.

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:17.790
So if you're in
course nine, you know

01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:21.510
that action potentials are
carried, basically electricity

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:23.250
along cells.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:23.880
What is that?

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.370
That is basically changing
membrane potentials

01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:27.870
across cells.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.580
More generally,
membrane potentials

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.030
can be used to do lots
of other types of work.

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:40.320
And so ATP is only one way that
cells can use biological energy

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.940
because it can be
coupled to otherwise

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.620
unfavorable reactions.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.960
But you can also
couple ion gradients

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.260
to unfavorable reactions
and use that to do work--

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:54.300
and so lots of useful
ways that delta psi delta

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:59.620
pH can be used by cells.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.990
And so what are some of these?

01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:06.970
Well, the first one is this
can be used to generate heat.

01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:09.810
So if you're checking
your phone right now,

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:12.120
your phone is obviously
a very useful device

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.280
to do all kinds of work for you.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.710
You can read whatever
you want on your phone,

01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:18.505
use it to call people.

01:24:18.505 --> 01:24:20.130
Well, what happens
if you short circuit

01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:21.480
the battery in your phone?

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.370
Well, it'll get really hot.

01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:26.100
And the same thing happens here.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:30.480
Rather than use this delta
psi delta pH to generate ATP,

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.080
if I just put a hole
in the membrane,

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:37.980
something referred to as
an uncoupling protein, UCP,

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.510
Uncoupling Protein, this will
just allow the leak of protons

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:44.880
back across the membrane.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.430
Well, that's short
circuiting the battery.

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.170
Energy has to be
dissipated somewhere,

01:24:49.170 --> 01:24:51.930
and it's dissipated as heat.

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:58.290
And this is effectively ways in
which biology can create heat.

01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:01.230
And so uncoupling proteins are
expressed in a tissue called

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:03.570
brown fat in mammals.

01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:06.900
Brown fat is a way
to generate heat.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.200
And it's one way that we
maintain our body temperatures.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.730
Now, the system is imperfect.

01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:14.370
And lots of cells,
all metabolism,

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.900
generates some heat.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.760
If you've ever done
composting, you

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.070
know your compost pile gets hot.

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:21.660
That's because the
organisms there

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.930
that are metabolized in the
material in the compost pile

01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.277
are generating some heat.

01:25:26.277 --> 01:25:28.110
And that's because
membranes aren't perfect.

01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:30.060
They're somewhat leaky.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.930
Now, as humans, we work hard
to maintain a constant body

01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:34.950
temperature.

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:36.990
And there's actually a
huge amount of energy

01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:40.540
that goes into just maintaining
our body temperature.

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.080
But you can imagine
how efficiently

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.760
we couple these processes will
determine how many calories we

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.800
need to maintain heat.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.110
And that's actually a
theory of weight control,

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:54.180
that those of us
out there who have

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.100
less well-coupled
mitochondria can

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.280
eat more because they waste
more energy in generating

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.650
heat than those of us who are
really efficient in doing this.

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:04.410
And in fact, there's
drugs that allow

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:07.880
you to uncouple
electron transport

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.540
generation of delta psi
delta pH from utilizing

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.700
that membrane potential.

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.895
And these are great
weight loss drugs.

01:26:15.895 --> 01:26:21.050
Dinitrophenol was used middle
part of the last century

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:22.210
as a weight loss agent.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.970
It was very effective.

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:26.080
The problem is it's also
incredibly dangerous

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080
because people will die.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.240
Because it turns out, if
you uncouple this process

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.280
and you don't have enough
ATP, you die really fast.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.750
And so don't use that
drug, but it illustrates

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:38.810
how you can use this
battery to generate

01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:42.270
heat, another form of energy.

01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:46.640
Another big one is
membrane transport.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.300
So if I want to concentrate
something-- and this

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:57.020
could be moving proteins.

01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.930
Or it could be
moving other ions,

01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:03.880
like in an action potential.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.740
Those are unfavorable
processes, right?

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:10.420
I'm causing dissociation
of ions across membranes

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.020
or moving protein from one
side of a membrane to another.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.790
One can couple those transfer
processes to these delta psi

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:20.420
delta pH as well.

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.410
And in fact, protein
import in the mitochondria

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:26.680
depends very much on
a membrane potential

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.540
to get those proteins in.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.430
The mitochondria is
an important site

01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:32.890
of calcium storage for cells.

01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:35.200
Calcium is concentrated
in the mitochondria.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.570
And that concentration
can be driven

01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:40.070
by this membrane potential.

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:42.700
And of course, this
potential can also

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:46.780
use to power lots of shuttles,
like the carnitine shuttle,

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.850
and actually create
situations where

01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:52.270
you have different conditions
across membranes as a way

01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:55.780
to favor different chemistries.

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.430
And so the last thing
I want to mention

01:27:57.430 --> 01:28:01.300
is, in fact, these
shuttles, which is just ways

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.260
that one can couple
membrane potential to drive

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:08.590
other things, can also be
really important for how

01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:10.270
metabolism works.

01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:12.950
And I just want to illustrate
one aspect of this.

01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:16.273
So if I draw here
my mitochondria--

01:28:16.273 --> 01:28:19.660
let me draw it up here.

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:26.980
If I draw a
mitochondria, so here's

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.460
all these processes
are happening here

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.630
where we have electron
transport generating

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:38.320
a potential across the
intermitochondrial membrane

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.100
that can be used
to synthesize ATP.

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:47.690
Well, this synthesis is
occurring in the mitochondria.

01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:52.010
But ultimately, I need
to get that ATP out

01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:57.260
into the cytosol for it
to be useful for the cell

01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.770
to run otherwise unfavorable
processes in the cytosol.

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:02.870
And so one needs a
transporter for this.

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.120
There's some transporter
called the adenine nucleotide

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.440
transporter.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.920
And this partially takes
advantage of the fact

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.350
that there's a charge
difference between ATP and ADP

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:18.220
to actually couple membrane
potential to exchange

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:24.370
of ATP/ADP between the cytosol
and the mitochondrial matrix.

01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:27.500
Now, there's other issues we'll
talk about next time as well.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.070
And so, remember,
some metabolism

01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:32.620
is happening in the cytosol.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:41.080
So glycolysis turning
glucose into pyruvate

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.850
is occurring in the cytosol.

01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:43.850
We've already discussed.

01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:45.267
That means you got
to get pyruvate

01:29:45.267 --> 01:29:47.620
in the mitochondria
for the PDH reaction,

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:51.970
but this is also generating
NADH in the cytosol.

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:55.330
And if that NADH needs
to transfer its electrons

01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:57.010
to oxygen, we also
have to get that

01:29:57.010 --> 01:30:02.170
NADH into the mitochondrial
matrix or, more correctly,

01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:05.090
transfer those electrons into
the mitochondrial matrix.

01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:08.770
It turns out cells maintain
distinct NAD/NADH pools

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.660
in the mitochondria
and the cytosol.

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.280
That's part of the
conditions that

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:17.560
make different reactions
favorable in each compartment.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.310
And how cells do that,
transfer those electrons

01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:25.060
into the mitochondria, ends up
being another important thing

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:28.630
that has to be transport that's
driven across these membranes

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:31.720
where one can use
delta psi delta pH.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.490
And we'll talk about that at
the start of the next lecture.

01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:36.040
Thanks.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning, class. Nice
to be here with you again

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
after a long hiatus. So,
we're going to talk today about

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the cell cycle. That is
to say the life of a cell,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
how a cell grows and
divides. And, as it turns out,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this is one of our first
entrees into cell biology.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is to say we're move,
beginning to move away from the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
molecules inside cells and beginning
to look at a, at the next higher

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
level of complexity which
is how cells proliferate.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It turns out this is a very critical
issue in a number of different

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
disease areas, including
notably cancer which we'll

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
start talking about next time.
And this is also the transition

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
point, the inflection point in the
semester when we begin to apply some

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of the things we've learned earlier
to learning about specific disease

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
processes. So, you'll
sense more and more

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
introduction of discussions of human
disease processes as the semester

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
goes from here on to the
end. And here, in fact,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is what we call the cell cycle.
And I'm going to get into the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
details of it quite shortly,
but the cell cycle is effectively

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the life cycle of a cell from the
moment it is born to the moment that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it, in turn, becomes the
mother of two daughter cells.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And this process is divided up,
as you can see, into four different

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
periods here, or as they are called
phases. These are cell cycle phases.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The first phase is
called M or mitosis.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The second phase is called G1 phase.
The third is called the S or the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
synthetic phase, and that
refers to the fact that

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
this is the time when
cells replicate their DNA.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And, as you can see, it
actually takes a long time

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because this entire cycle in
cultured mammalian cells normally

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
takes as much as a day for
a mammalian cell to divide,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
grow and divide. Contrast that,
by the way, with many bacterial

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
cells which can grow and
divide in 30, 30 minutes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, our cells take a lot
longer to divide, many of them,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but there are exceptions to that.
After cells have gone through G,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
through S phase they go into G2.
And these two Gs are, are called Gs

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because of the gaps they have.
Here's the gap between S phase and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
M phase, or mitosis. G1 is
the gap between mitosis and,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the, the subsequent
S phase. And, obviously,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the most important parts of the
cell cycle are the time when the cell

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
divides, which is mitosis, and
the time it replicates its DNA

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is in S phase. One
reason why it's so important is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that one has to be sure that cells
that arise from the process of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
growth and division,
which is what this is,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
actually end up with a full genome's
worth of DNA and chromosomes.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And, therefore, during S
phase there has to be a precise

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
replication of all the 3. billion
bases in the haploid genome,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
or 6.4 billion in
the diploid genome.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And during M phase there has to be
a precise allocation of the resulting

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
replicated DNA in equal,
exactly equal parts to the two

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
daughter cells. And
this is no mean feat.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It is an extraordinarily
challenging process,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which cells, it turns out, with
very high efficiency through a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
variety of complex control
mechanisms. And with this outline

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in mind, I just want to go into some
of its details to illustrate to you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
why we think that the scheme
is organized the way it is.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The fact of the matter is that the,
that the M phase, or the mitosis is

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
actually organized into a series
of sub phases. And you may remember

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that from high school biology but
I'll just go into it in some detail,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not because we're going to dwell on
it but just because I want to give

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
you a feeling for what it's composed
of. It's composed of a series of,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of sub, sub phases I just mentioned.
And, importantly, we start out with

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
an interphase cell. And
interphase refers to the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
entirety of the cell cycle
outside of M. That is the entirety,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
entirety outside of the M phase
thereby including G1S and G2.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And you notice that what happens
in prophase is, first of all,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the chromosomes condense. And
that's very important because prior

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to that condensation the chromatin,
and chromatin represents the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
material out of which the
chromosomes is assembled consisting

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
largely of DNA and proteins with
a big of RNA, the chromatin is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
dispersed through the nucleus.
It's not condensed together.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And as such, as you can see
here, one doesn't see any specific

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
chromosomes because they're
just scattered about the whole

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
chromosomes in a very dilute form.
But once the condensations happen,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the condensation of chromosomes
happen then one begins to appreciate

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that there are chromosomes.
Indeed, if it were not for the case

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that this, this condensation would
happen, it would have taken a very

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
long time before we even realized
at the beginning of the 20th century

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that there were distinct
chromosomes themselves.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Because when you look in the
nucleus like this, and as you,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
one might do, be doing here
stains for DNA, one doesn't see any

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
distinct structures within the
nucleus. Here this condensation

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
causes a delineation of
these structures in humans,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
as you know this being 46.
And, by the way, this, this,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
this sequence of events is, is
basically standard hardware for all

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
eukaryote cells. It's
not as if we invented this

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
recently. This whole sequence of
events has largely been around for 1.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
billion years. One thing
you begin to notice here

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
already as we go into the Metaphase,
this is the beginning of metaphase,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
it's sometimes called prometaphase
if one wants to split it up even

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
further, is the beginning of
the disappearance of the nuclear

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
membrane. So, here we are
in a situation where the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
chromosomes are no longer physically
separated from the cytoplasm by the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
nuclear membrane. The
membrane, in effect,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
disappears. It dissolves.
Obviously, at another point it's

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
going to have to reassemble when
one starts making daughter cells.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And at this point one begins
to see quite distinctly the,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that, that each chromosome
is composed of two chromatids.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
A chromatid is each one of these
arms. And the fact that there are

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
two of them is a direct consequence
of the previous DNA replication

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
which made from one
chromatid two chromatids.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, these two chromatids are
identical, one to the other.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
They're the consequence
of the previous S phase of,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the previous DNA replication.
And if all things have gone well

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
then these two chromatids have
identical DNA sequences because

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
they're the descendants of a
single chromatid that existed,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
actually a chromosome as
it's called at that point,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
existed at the beginning of S
phase. In fact, the fidelity of DNA

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
replication, that is to say
the accuracy with which DNA is

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
replicated is so good that often
one can demonstrate that the mistakes

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that are made are less than
one in ten to the ninth bases.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
That's stunning. One
in ten to the ninth,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
only one in ten to the ninth basis
actually is, ends up being miscopies.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In fact, we now realize that the
reason why there's such enormous

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
fidelity is that the DNA polymerases
that previously begin to replicate

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the DNA to generate these chromatids
make a mistake of about one in ten

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to the minus five bases. So,
they're much more error prone.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But there are subsequent
proofreading mechanisms.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Just the way you would copy
edit text, there are proofreading

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
mechanism which erase those
errors and reduce the end result of

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
miscopying, of misreplication down
in one, down to one and ten to the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
minus ninth. And given that
the genome itself is only,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
the haploid genome is only 3.
billion, that is 3.2 times ten to

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the ninth basis of DNA, that
means that there are only about,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
roughly speaking, three
mistakes made in the entire

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
genome each time a cell goes through
a cell cycle in the haploid genome.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, what we begin to notice here
in prometaphase is also the beginning

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
of the assembly of the machinery
that will eventually divide those

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
two chromatids from one another.
And here, in the midst of metaphase,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as you see in the top left, now
the chromosomes line up in what

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
is effectively a two-dimensional
plane in the middle.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It's called an equatorial
plane in the middle of the cell.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Where, as you can see here in
this schematic, each chrome,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
each chromosome is, here's
once again the two chromatids,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and these chromid, the places
where these two chromatids are held

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
together are lined up in this plane
with the arms of the chromosomes

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
kind of flopping around,
as you can see here. What's

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
critical here is the points
where these, these two chrome,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
chromatids are joint. And
those, those points of joining,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
as I'll mention in a moment,
those are called centromeres.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Here, here is a more schematized
view of what's about to happen,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
just to give you a feeling for
what this really looks like.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And here, as, as we begin to
move later into the mitosis,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we begin to see that each of the
chromatids is joined here by a

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
centromere and that there, and
that there are mitotic spindles

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
which are reaching from these paired
chromosomes to centrioles at either

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
side of the cell. So,
these two centrioles,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the whole apparatus
itself is called a centrosome,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
have microtubules that reach
from, from the centro, from the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
centromeres here in the chromosomes,
so the, so the structure in the

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
middle of the chromosome
is called a centromere.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Via microtubules that reach all the
way over to one pole or the other.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, you see, one effect
has two poles here. And if,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and if we begin to develop this
further, we, we've just gotten into

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
serious metaphase here. And
now what we see in anaphase is

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that the two chromatids
are being separated apart,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they're being pulled apart
by these microtubule spindles.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
These are called spindle fibers,
which reach from each of those

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
centrosomes over here back to
the chromosomes, and literally are

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
involved in the mechanical pulling
them apart, one from the other.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And to state the obvious, if we're
talking about the fidelity of DNA

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
replication, here we need also to
talk about the fact that when one

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
has a set of paired chromatids,
one of the chromatids has to go to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
one side and one to the other.
That, in itself, is in principle

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
also an error-prone mechanism,
or an error-prone process.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Mistakes could be made. And
indeed in cancer cells where

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
many of these processes break down
sometimes one has both chromatids

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
going to one or the other side.
And as you can intuit from that,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that leads obviously to a disruption
of the normal makeup of the

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
chromosomes that are eventually
allocated to each of the two

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
daughter cells. In fact,
this allocation happens

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
here at telophase, the
last of the four major sub

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
phases of mitosis. Here you
see that what's happened is

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that the, these chromatids
have now been pulled apart.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And the moment that they're pulled
apart and no longer paired up one

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
with the other they now
are recognized, once again,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to be card-carrying chromosomes.
So, now here, here you see the

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
nomenclature has changed. Now
they're chromosomes. They're

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
being pulled, pulled apart.
And, obviously, one wants an

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
identical set of chromosomes
in both daughter cells.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And once they're allocated to the
two future daughter cells the entire

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
mitotic spindle dissolve.
And, as you can imagine,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
there is a reformation, as is
indicated here schematically and not

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
very clearly, in the nuclear
membrane. So now the whole cell is

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
reconstructed and now each of
the two daughter cells is able,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in principle, to split off one from
the other and to go off on its merry

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
way. And this looks like a
really neat process. And in some

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
eukaryotic cells it happens much
more rapidly than the 24 hours that

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I just indicated to you. There
are indications that in some

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
lymphocyte populations it
only takes three or four hours.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And in some early embryonic cell
populations, where there's an

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
absolutely frenetic pace
of cell growth and division,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
it may happen every 30 minutes
rather than the 24 hours I just

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
talked about. And you'll say, so
what, that, who cares about that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But 30 minutes for replicating an
entire 6.4 billion bases of DNA and

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
then allocating them to two
daughter cells is actually quite

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
an achievement. And we
don't really understand how

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that happens. I've talked
implicitly about the process of cell

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
growth and division. And
what I mean to say in more

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
detail about that is the following.
After one gets these two initial

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
daughter cells they're obviously
only half the size of the previously

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
existing mother cell. And,
therefore, what must happen in

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the subsequent cell cycle is that
each of these daughter cells must

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
actually physically grow in size
so that it once again becomes a big

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
mama over here after
the next cell cycle.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so that growth begins
immediately. And much of it occurs

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
just through the generation
of new sets of ribosomes,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
new proteins, new membranes
in the cell. All of the complex

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
constituents of a cell need to be
duplicated for the next cell cycle

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
including, obviously,
all of the organelles,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the small structures in
the cytoplasm and including,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
indeed, the mitochondria. So,
imagine now the complexity of

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
this because not only is the
eukaryotic cell so complex but its

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
entire contents must be faithfully
replicated during the subsequent

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
cell cycle. And that obviously
implies the intervention,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the involvement of very complex
control mechanisms about which we

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
understand almost nothing.
Now, how, let's get back to this

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
for a moment, because what I've been
talking about over the last six to

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
eight minutes is simply
mitosis, the M phase here.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
In fact, in many of these
early embryonic cell cycles,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
what happens is that cells go from M
phase directly into S phase and from

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
S phase directly into M. In
other words, they don't indulge

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
themselves in a period over here,
a long period, and in some cultured

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
mammalian cells this can be
12 or 14 hours of getting set,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
getting prepared
for DNA replication.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Similarly, after cells
have replicated their DNA,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and as we just said, for example,
converted one chromosome into two

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
paired chromatids, after
they get through S phase

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
they'll also wait another four or
five hours, most cultured mammalian

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
cells before they go back into
M phase, these two gap periods.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Well, how do we actually know
how long each of these gaps takes?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Well, as is usual, I'm
glad I asked that question.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And one way we can do
so is the following.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
What we can do is we can take cells
and we can block them in mitosis.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
How can we block them in mitosis?
We can use a microtubule antagonist.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So, I told you before that the
spindle fibers that pull the

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
chromosomes apart are made of
microtubules. Microtubules happen

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to be one of the constituents of the
cytoskeleton that gives structure to

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
the cell, and these microtubules are
used as the fibers for pulling apart

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the two chromatids during
anaphase, as I just mentioned.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And we can use a microtubule
antagonist. And in biochemistry,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
when you want to antagonize
something often you use a symbol

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
like this. And, for
instance, here's a drug called

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
colcemid, and colcemid is
a microtubule antagonist.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And even though it has a bit of an
effect on the overall cytoskeleton,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
if you put colcemid on cells then
they'll go into mitosis like this

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and they'll go into metaphase,
as we indicated before, but the

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
subsequent sub phases of mitosis
will, will grind to a halt.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Why? Because the microtubule
spindle fibers will be unable to

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
assemble properly because of this,
now, I forget whether there's an E

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
here or not. Probably not.
OK. Typo. The colcemid prevents

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the spindle fibers from forming,
so therefore cells get hung up, they

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
get blocked in M phase. In
fact, if you're interested in

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
looking at the, at the
array of chromosomes in a

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cell, the simplest way of
doing it with a mammalian,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
with a human cell is to put colcemid
in it, and the colcemid will block

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
them in, in M phase,
they'll block them in,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
in metaphase, they can't get out of
metaphase simply because these pink

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
fibers here are unable to assemble
properly, and therefore they get

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
hung up right here while the
chromosomes are condensed.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And this allows you to visualize
the chromosomes under the microscope.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Why do need to do that? Well, in
the absence of blocking cells and

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
trapping them in, in
metaphase, cells will just spin

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
right around the cell cycle and
they'll only be in metaphase for

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
maybe only 10 or 15 minutes
out of the 24 hours. And,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
therefore, in a population of cells
which is moving around the cell

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
cycle willy-nilly very rapidly,
only a minute fraction of the cells

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
at any one point in time will, by
chance, be in metaphase when you

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
want to study their chromosomes.
So, the best thing to do is to try

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
to block them in metaphase.
Now, what you can do, in fact,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
is put cells in metaphase, and I'm
going to draw the cell cycle around

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
here again. Here's M, here's
S phase, slightly different

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
than what we just saw before,
here's G1, and here is G2. So,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
now we're going to block cells with
colcemid right here in metaphase.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And now what happens is that
we put metaphase in. Ideally,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
if we put it in for a day we'd start
out with a population of cells which

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
we will call asynchronous.
Asynchronous means that at any one

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
point in time these cells will be
distributed randomly around the cell

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
cycle. They'll be all
over the place, obviously,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
because there's nothing to cause
them to move synchronously through

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
the cell cycle. A random
population of cells will be

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
scattered all over the cells cycle
like this. We put in colcemid,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and what's gradually going to happen
is that cells are moving around the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
cell cycle and when they get
to here they'll start piling up.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
In principle, if all the cells are
scattered around the cell cycle at

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
the moment you put in the colcemid,
and it takes them 24 hours to get

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
all the way around the cell cycle,
then after a day's worth of colcemid

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
treatment all the cells should
have piled up right here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
In fact, you can begin to look.
What, what's the kinetics with which

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
cells pile up into the M phase?
And it looks like this. They go

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
around, they go on piling up, and
then at the end of 24 hours they

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
plateau. Why do they plateau at
24 hours? Because by 24 hours the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
stragglers, which started out right
here, will have had time to go all

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
the way around the cell cycle
and get trapped in M phase.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And that gives you a feeling for
how long the entire cell cycle time

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
is, now, or this cycle which
I called growth and division.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And, again, to emphasize,
growth is literally the physical

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
growth of the cell. Division
is the production of two

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
daughter cells at mitosis. Now,
in principle, we can relieve

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
this metaphase block by
getting rid of the colcemid.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And now, interestingly enough,
we have a population of cells that

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
is emerging from
metaphase synchronously.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
What do I mean by that? I mean
to indicate that they're all

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
moving in lockstep. They're
all moving at the same time

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
out of the cell cycle, so
now there's a whole cohort of

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
cells which starts out right here.
They've all left metaphase at the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
same time. This is not
an asynchronous culture.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And they start moving around,
advancing around the cell cycle

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
together. In principle you'd say,
well, they should remain synchronous

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
forever. But the fact is all of
these phases of the cell cycle,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
the times are quasi-stochastic,
sometimes go, some cells go through

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
G1 in ten hours, some
cells go through cells in

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
eleven hours, some
through in eight hours.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And, as a consequence, as
they move further and further

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
around the cell cycle, the
population of cells becomes

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
progressively more asynchronous
and they won't really enter into the

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
next M phase totally synchronously.
But now we can ask the following

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
question, how long is G1? And
the way we can do that is to do

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
another kind of experiment where
what we do is we release cells,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
a population of cells from M
phase by removing the colcemid,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
for example. And
now we treat cells,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
we, we treat aliquots of this
synchronously advancing population.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Each hour we pluck out some of
these cells and we expose them for,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
let's say, the next hour thereafter
to some tritiated thymidine.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Tritiated thymidine, as you
may recall, H3 thymidine as it's

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
sometimes denoted, is
obviously a radiolabeled

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
precursor of DNA. And it's
going to get incorporated

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
into the DNA and, and to
no other macromolecules in

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the cell. And so the question is if
we expose cells for an hour here to

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
tritiated thymidine, how
much tritiated thymidine is

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
going to be incorporated into
their DNA? How do we know what's

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
incorporated and how much tritiated
thymidine remains unincorporated?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We extract the DNA from the cells
and we precipitate it in an acid.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And when that happens the
macromolecules of DNA go to the

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
bottom, they precipitate, and
the unincorporated tritiated

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
thymidine, which is still soluble,
it has not yet been polymerized into

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
DNA molecules, remains
in the acid solution.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So, we asked how much
acid-precipitable thymidine counts

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
are there here? How
many in the next,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
are made in the next hour
with another aliquot of cells?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
How many in the next hour and
so forth? And when we do such an

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
experiment we find that we get
a, a curve which looks like this.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
All of a sudden, here
we got no sales labeling,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
in the second hour none, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, in the seventh

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
hour there are some cells which make
DNA, in the eighth hour there are

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
some cells, even more cells making
DNA, and by the time they're in the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
ninth or the tenth hour then we
find a high rate of DNA synthesis.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Now, in principle we could continue
this experiment if we wanted to,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
if we had enough money for tritiated
thymidine, which one does because

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
it's very cheap. And what
would find is if we started

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
labeling over here with, for
another hour pulse, when I say

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
an hour pulse I mean we just put
the tritiated thymidine in at the

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
beginning of this one-hour
period way over here,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and an hour later we take out the
cells and extract their DNA and

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
measure how much DNA has been
incorporated in that interval.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And if we did a tritiated
thymidine pulse over here,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
we'd begin to see that the rate of
DNA synthesis was actually lower,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
and eventually it would go down,
back down to this as the cells were

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
moving asynchronously
through the culture.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
What does that mean?
Well, this is the time,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
obviously these cells are in S
phase, these cells were in G1,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
and these cells have now emerged
from S phase into G2 and are no

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
longer making DNA. And on
that basis we can actually

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
calculate, we can determine how
many hours it takes for cells to move

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
through G1. We can do a similar
kind of experiment to figure out how

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
long G2 is, the gap 2, G2 phase is.
G2, recall, is the time between the

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
ending of DNA replication
and the beginning of mitosis.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And how do we do that? Well,
we can do an inhibitor of DNA

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
synthesis. So,
let's say, here is,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I'm going to redraw the cell cycle.
Here's S phase, G2, I'm drawing it

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
again, here's M, and here's G1.
And now what we can do is we'll add

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
a DNA synthesis inhibitor. An
inhibitor of DNA synthesis has

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
no effect, as you could imagine,
on M phase. This is one of those

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
things, it's called hydroxyurea.
It actually blocks the biosynthesis

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
of the precursors, the,
the oxyribonucleoside

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
triphosphate precursors of DNA.
And, therefore, you add hydroxyurea

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
to cells and they, their,
their DNA replication grinds

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
to a halt. OK.
So, let's do that.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
And we'll, we'll, we'll add
hydroxyurea to the cells for 24

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
hours. What's going to happen?
What will the distribution of cells

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
be afterwards?
Well, in fact,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
some of the cells, when we
first added the hydroxyurea

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
the cells were scattered all around,
they were asynchronous. We'll add

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
the hydroxyurea and what
we'll find is the following.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
The cells that were in the middle
of S phase when we added the

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
hydroxyurea will be stuck dead in
the water. They won't be able to

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
move anymore. So, these
cells that were in S phase,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the moment we add the hydroxyurea
will be trapped right here.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
They cannot make anymore DNA.
And, therefore, they'll be frozen

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
at many points, times,
points in time in S phase.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
The cells that are outside of S
phase, they can continue to advance

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
all the way around the cell cycle.
And, accordingly, there'll be lots

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
of cells over the next 24 hours
that are going to just pile up at the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
G1-S transition. Why? Well,
the hydroxyurea has no effect

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
at all on these other points of
the cell cycle. And when these cells

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
try to go, go from G1 into S, they
cannot get into S phase because

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
they can't make any DNA so
they're trapped right over there.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And now we'll take away
the hydroxyurea, which is,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
obviously is, to use the notation
I used before, an inhibitor of DNA

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
synthesis. And what we can
do now is the following.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
We're going to ask, after
we take out the hydroxyurea

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
we're going to put in colcemid.
Why do we want to do that? Well,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
what we really want to do is to ask,
after the cells have reached, have

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
gone through S phase, how
soon does a labeled cell move

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
from S phase all the way into
M phase? How long does it take?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
How long is G2? And so what
we'll do is the following.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
We take away the hydroxyurea.
This allows all these cells to

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
begin to move out. Is this
a fully synchronous culture?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Well, actually, no, because some
of these cells are over here.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
There's a whole bunch over here.
These are synchronous, but the rest

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
of the ones they're
already scattered out,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
so there's going to be some pioneers
over here moving ahead of the

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
phalanx, and they'll be some
straggles and then there's going to

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
be a big slug of these cells that
are moving as the rear guard ahead.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Now, what we're going to do, after
we take away the hydroxyurea we're

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
going to add our
old friend colcemid.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And colcemid, I tried to
spell it right this time,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
colcemid is going to block cells,
as we obviously said before, right

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
over here. And then what we're
going to do is the following.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
We're going to look, every hour
we're going to take some cells and

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
put them in colcemid, or we'll
leave them in colcemid the

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
whole time and every hour we'll
take cells out of the Petri dish,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
which have been in colcemid since
they were released from here,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and we're going to look
at the metaphase cells.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And how do we look at
the metaphase cells?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Well, here's a metaphase cell.
Here will be its chromosomes.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Obviously, they're chromatids
at this point. They're under the

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
microscope. And they
start accumulating up here.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
And each and every hour we're going
to take some of these metaphase

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
cells, we'll take them out of the
Petri dish, and after we've put them

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
in, or we'll leave them in
the Petri dish if you want,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
and after they're there and they've,
they've come over here we'll fix

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
them onto the plate. We'll
add some alcohol or something

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
which causes them to stick to
the plate, they can't swim away,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and then after that we'll
add some radioactive emulsion.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So, here's, let's imagine here is
a cell at the bottom of the plate in

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
metaphase, we're going to add some
photographic emulsion on top of that

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
like that. And then what we're
going to see is how soon we can

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
detect radioactive metaphase
chromosomes. How can we do that?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Because each time an electron
leaves the tritiated thymidine,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
each time a beta particle leaves
it's going to cause a grain of

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
emulsion, of silver to form in the,
in the photographic emulsion that

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
we've layered above the cell. So,
this photo emulsion is only not

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
a way of detecting light but
a way of detecting when there,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
whenever there's radioactivity
in, that's being emitted. And what

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
we're going to look for are grains,
silver grains that are located above

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
the chromosomes in the microscope.
We could look down through this

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
plate, through the emulsion, on
the chromosomes we can see them

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
clearly. I've shown you that before,
and we're going to ask ourselves the

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
question, when can we begin to
associate silver grains with the

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
chromosomes? Because those silver
grains must have been incorporated

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
into the chromosomes
during the previous S phase,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
that is when cells were over here.
If a cell was over here and we added

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
colcemid and there won't be any,
it won't be radioactively labeled.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So, what we're really going
to ask now is the following.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
These cells are all
advancing through like this,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
they're advancing into M phase,
when does the first radiolabeled

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
cell get, after we release them
with hydroxyurea, when does it get,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
when do we first see cells like this?
And the fact is after five or six

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
hours after we've released them from
S phase then we begin to see cells

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
like this which have chromosomes
on which there is radio,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
with which there's
radioactivity associated.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Well, keep in mind that when cells
move through the S phase here,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
this is when they incorporated
tritiated thymidine to their DNA.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Cells can't incorporate
tritiated thymidine here.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
They can't incorporate it here.
They can't incorporate it here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
OK? Right. So, we can
allow cells to incorporate a

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
little bit of tritiated thymidine,
we can freeze them in here, we'll

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
allow, give them a little bit,
bit of tritiated thymidine, let it

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
get into the DNA here, and
then we'll add hydroxyurea very

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
shortly thereafter and freeze
the cells right like this.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So, they'll be, they'll be
radioactive by virtue of having

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
dwelled here at different times
in the S phase. And when we add

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
hydroxyurea then, the
cells that were already in S

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
phase and incorporated a bit
of tritiated thymidine will

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
remain in S phase. All of
the other cells which were,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
when we added the hydroxyurea
over here, they will go all the way

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
around here. They will move all
the way around the cell cycle.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
They might have happened to
incorporated a little bit of

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
tritiated thymidine before
we added the hydroxyurea,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
but they'll get trapped over here.
So the only, so the cells that have

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
tritiated thymidine, they
will be scattered at various

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
points in the S phase. We'll
remove the hydroxyurea that

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
allows the cells to escape
from S phase and move all the

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
way around to here. And then
we begin to look for seeing

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
when cells get radiolabeled
chromosomes. Is that clearer now?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
A little clear. OK. Now, let's
begin to ask how this is all

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
coordinated. What determines how
cells, when cells will grow and when

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
cells with not grow? So,
let's go back to our depiction

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
of the cell cycle. How
do, what controls all this?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
What determines when a cell is
going to move around the cell cycle?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
In our bodies we have roughly three
times ten to the thirteenth cells.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I don't know if that's a number
I mentioned to you before.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
It's a pretty interesting
number. It's probably not the most

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
interesting number. By
now far more people are

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
interested in the number of how many
games the Red Sox have won or lost,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
but it's a number anyhow. How many
cell divisions do we go through in a

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
lifetime? Did we ever talk about
that? How many times do we have a

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
cell growth and division
cycle in a human lifetime,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
lifetime? And the answer is in
human lifetime there are about ten

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
to the sixth cell divisions.
It's a staggering number.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Ten to the sixteenth in one
human body in a human lifetime.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And if you figure out what that
amounts to, I think it's something

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
like, and you can figure it out
yourself, I think it amounts to

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
something like ten to the seventh
cell divisions in each second.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
So, each time I'm talking with you
I'm going, I've already gone through

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
any one of my sentences.
And by the time my longwinded

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
sentence is finished, I've
probably already had 100

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
million mitoses happening
inside of me. That's --

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Maybe even more because some
of my sentences are really long.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
So, imagine that, ten to
the seventh for a second.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
You can figure out the number.
This is a lifetime of let's say you

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
live 70 years, you can
do the math of how many it

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
is per second. A lot
of that's going on,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
by the way, in the bone marrow
and in the gut, because in the bone

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
marrow you're constantly replacing
a lot of your red blood cells.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
You have lots of them, but
they only last for 120 days.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So, after 120 days a red blood cell
is broken down and you get a new red

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
blood cell in its place. But
obviously you have more than

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
one blood cell in your body. The
same thing happens in the gut.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
The cells lining the gut, those
are called epithelial cells,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
they're lining the surface of the
gut, and they are constantly being

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
sloughed off the wall of the gut.
Why? Because it's not so nice to

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
live on the wall of the
gut. It's not a very pleasant

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
environment. And the
cells are therefore

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
constantly gotten, gotten
rid of because they have a

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
hard time surviving for
extended periods of time.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Those cells live only three or
four days on the wall of the gut.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So, when you go to the bathroom,
I don't mean to be too graphic, but

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
number two, a significant proportion
of what comes out the bottom is

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
actually cells that have been
sloughed off from the epithelial

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
lining of the gut. I don't
know what the proportion is.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
It's something like 20% or 30%.
About half of what comes out is

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
actually bacterial in the,
in the feces. We're not having

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
lunch now so you can,
you can absorb all this,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
right? About half of it.
Almost none of the bulk of the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
feces actually ends up being what
you ate because most of what you ate

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
ended up, ends up getting compressed
to a very small amount of solid

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
matter. So, most of what
comes out is, is not what,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
what came in, is not the
processing of food but other things,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
as I've just mentioned.
And, by the way,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
here's another unsettling statistic.
It's not so graphic but it's

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
unsettling if you think about it.
There are more bacterial cells in

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
your gut than in the rest, than
there are mammalian eukaryotic

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
cells in the rest of your body.
They're taking over. There are

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
more of them than there are
us in each one of our bodies.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Go figure. Anyhow. Why
am I going on this long

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
excursion? Well, only he
knows and he's not telling.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But there was a reason behind it.
The reason why I'm going into this

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
is to impress on you the fact
that it's really important that the

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
advance of cells through their
growth and division cycle that we've

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
just talked about here is
very carefully controlled,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
because each one of these growth,
cell growth and division cycles is

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
the opportunity for disaster.
What kind of disaster?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Well, if the cell makes a mistake
in its chromosomes it might die.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
The death of a cell in
our body is not a disaster.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I just indicated to you that we're,
we're making ten to the seventh new

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
cells every second, but
hopefully we're making exactly

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
the same number of cells that die.
So, ten to the seventh cells are

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
made for every ten to the
seventh cells that die.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
If you have an excess of new cells
compared with dying cells you're in

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
bad shape because that's
really the disease of cancer.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And that implies, even
with our knowing any,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
without our knowing anything else
about cancer, that there have to be

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
very careful controls over the
decision on the part of a cell to

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
whether, as to whether it can grow
or divide, as to whether or not it

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
should grow and divide.
Now, what does that mean?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Well, part of the decisions come
from the following situation.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Let's imagine here we're growing,
we're talking about a human tissue.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Each one of these things is a cell.
And, as usual, my art is not that

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
splendid. But one of
the things I want to

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
impress on you is that the body
cannot give license to this cell or

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
to this cell or to this cell to
make the decision about growing and

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
dividing on its own. A cell
cannot go and say I think I

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
feel like dividing,
I'm going to go do it.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
That's a no-no. Why is it a no-no?
Because the moment one grants

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
autonomy to such a cell one's
in a very dangerous situation.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Instead, what has to happen, what
must happen is that cells talk

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
to one another and
cells read a consensus.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
For instance, maybe there's a cell
that's missing right over here in

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
this tissue. And keep in mind an
architecturally complex tissue has a

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
precise number of cells in it
organized in a very precise pattern.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And the way that pattern is
maintained is that the cells are

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
constantly looking around and
seeing is there a gap here?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Do we need to make a new cell or
not? It's not as if this cell says,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
well, I'm happy here and all
my neighbors are happy but,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
still, I'm going to grow and
divide because it seems like

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
a nice thing to do. Again,
that's an invitation for

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
disaster. And I'm saying that if
only to impress upon you the fact

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
that cells only will make the
decision to grow and divide and to

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
go into this cell cycle on the
basis of consultations with their

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
neighbors. They're constantly
talking to one another.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
The signals, the intercellular
signals within a living tissue

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
represent constant
ceaseless chatter.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
It's like everybody is on a cell
phone talking with six or eight or

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
ten of his or her neighbors all
the time. And if you could hear it,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
it would be a real din. So, that
raised the question how do cells

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
talk with one another? What
messages do they exchange,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
one with the other, so that they can
establish some kind of consensus as

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
to whether or not it's inappropriate
for one of their number to grow and

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
divide? All right. This
is an unauthorized ad.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
You can interpret
it the way you want.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Anyhow. So how do they do that?
Well, what they do, one of the most

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
important ways they communicate
is they exchange proteins with one

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
another called growth factors.
And a growth factor goes from one

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
cell, here's a cell, it
releases a growth factor and it

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
goes to a second cell and induces
the second cell to begin to divide.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
That's a mechanism of transferring
the signal or conveying the signal.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And a growth factor itself is a
relatively low molecular weight

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
protein which travels
through interstellular,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
interstellar, intercellular space.
It moves from one cell to the other.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So, it's secreted by one cell, it
moves here, and then it goes over

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
here to a second cell. In
fact, if we want to blow up the

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
second cell, the second cell has on
its surface a specific protein which

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
is known as a receptor or, in
this case, we can say a growth

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
factor receptor, which
represents a means by which

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
that cell senses the presence of a
growth factor in the extracellular

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
space. And, as is
suggested in this very

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
crude and poorly drawn cartoon,
this receptor is a transmembrane

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
protein. It has an extra cellular
domain, it has an intracellular

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
domain, and it moves through,
it protrudes through the lipid

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
bilayer of the plasma membrane.
We talked very briefly about these

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
at the beginning of the semester.
And what happens is these receptors

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
are so configured that in the event
that a growth factor comes over and

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
is sent off by a neighboring cell,
the growth factor, I'll draw it here

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
as a, as a square, this
growth factor binds to the

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
receptor in a very specific fashion.
And, as a consequence, the receptor

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
responds in its intracellular
or cytoplasmic domain by emitting

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
signals into the cell informing the
cell that an encounter has been had

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
in the extracellular space with
this growth factor which has been

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
released ostensibly
by another cell.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Now, the fact of the matter is there
are many different kinds of growth

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
factors. Here I've drawn, drawn,
drawn a square one. Here's a

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
triangular one.
Here's a circular one.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And each one of these growth
factors has its own cognate receptor.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So, here's a receptor that
binds circular growth factors.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Here's a receptor that binds
triangular growth factors.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Well, obviously I'm very schematic.
The point I wish to make is that

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
there are multiple distinct kinds of
receptors, and each growth factor we

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
can, I'll abbreviate it as a,
as a GF, each growth factor is

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
what's called a ligand, or a
ligand depending on where you

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
live, a ligand for the receptor.
So, in this case the square thing

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
is the ligand for the receptor.
It binds to the receptor and,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
in so doing, it provokes the
receptor to emit a signal which his

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
transferred in through the plasma
membrane into the cell cytoplasm.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Clearly, what I also wish to
indicate by this is that growth

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
factors don't bind to inappropriate
receptors. They only bind to their

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
appropriate receptors or
their cognate receptors.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So, for example, there's a
growth factor that we'll talk

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
about shortly. It's
called epidermal

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
growth factor.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And I'll just abbreviate
GF for growth factor.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
There's another growth factor
that called platelet-derived

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
growth factor.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So, we have EGF, we have
PDGF, platelet-derived

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
growth factor. And, in
fact, there's actually 30

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
or 40 other kinds of growth factors.
And each one binds specifically to

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
its own receptors. And so
now we begin to understand

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
that the signaling channels
are actually very multiplexed.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
It's not just at one, one kind of
growth factor can travel through

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
intercellular space. And,
again, this cell will only

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
receive, will only make a decision
to grow and divide if its growth

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
factor receptors have send an
adequate number of stimulatory

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
signals into the cell which then
pursued the signaling circuitry

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
which processes these signals that
it is indeed time to make the binary

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
decision, growth versus non-growth
on the basis of these signals

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
received from the
extracellular space.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
From that we can already intuit
something interesting about cancer

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
cells. Cancer cells make a decision
to grow even without having received

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
the signal from their neighbors.
In other words, cancer cells become

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
quasi or totally, they
become growth factor

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
independent. That is
to say somehow they have

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
usurped and perturbed this signaling
mechanism and they have no longer

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
become dependent on these
extracellular signals in order to

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
make the decision to grow and divide.
They will just grow in essentially

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
an autonomous or independent fashion.
And we know a little bit about this

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
from the following
kind of experiment.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
If you put a human connective tissue
cell, a connective tissue cell is

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
called a fibroblast in culture or
even a mouse, fibroblast in culture,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
you put it in a Petri dish like
this, it'll sit on the bottom.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
You can provide this fibroblast or
fibroblasts with all the nutrients

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
it needs, with glucose and
with vitamins and vital amino,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
essential amino acids, whatever
you want, give it all those low

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
molecular weight compounds and the,
and the fibroblasts will sit down on

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
the dish. And it will
look up at you and smile.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
And it will do so for days and
weeks. It won't do anything.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It won't grow at all. Why?
Because you haven't given it the

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
requisite signals to induce it,
to persuade it, to proliferate. And

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
what are those requisite signals?
They are growth factors. So, you

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
need to add growth factors in
addition to the nutrients in order

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
to persuade a cell to emerge from
its quiescent state into the active

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
growth and division cycle. And
so in my last minutes or my last

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
minute, hopefully not on this
earth but in this lecture,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
let me just say that when you, I
mean nothing is sure, but if you

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
take a cell and you deprive it,
you starve it of growth factors it

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
exits from the active growth and
division cycle and it will go out

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
into another phase called G zero.
And it will sit there like a bump on

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
a log for an extended period of
time. It will be metabolically active,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
viable, but it won't proliferate.
It will be like the cells you put in

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the Petri dish without growth
factors. And if you give it growth

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
factors then the cell will go back
into the G1 phase of the cell cycle

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
and begin active growth cycling.
It will pass through a successive

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
cycles of growth and division as
long as you give it growth factors.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And each time the cell emerges from
M it's going to ask the question,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
are there any growth factors around
me? If so, I might commit myself to

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
doing this over again. And
if there aren't, I'm getting

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
out of this racetrack and going over
to G zero where I may stay for days,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
weeks or years. On that
dramatic and tense note, see

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
you on Wednesday.

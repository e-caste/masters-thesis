WEBVTT

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:17.820
PROFESSOR: It's going to
be a great lecture today.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.720
It's about proteins.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.040
I love proteins.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.780
Don't forget the handout, yeah.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.880
OK, so I'm going
to briefly wrap up

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.130
the lecture we were doing
on Friday because there were

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.520
a couple of things that I
wanted to make a note of,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.430
and then we'll move
on to section 2.3

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.280
about amino acids,
peptides, and proteins.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.980
Now, in the last
class, I introduced you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
to the lipidic molecules,
and you can pick them out

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
of a lineup because they are
rich in carbon-carbon and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.970
carbon-hydrogen bonds.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.350
As you can see here in
these line-angled drawings,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.930
the majority of a lot
of these molecules

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.110
is carbon-carbon or
carbon-hydrogen hydrogen.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.280
They are molecules that are
mostly hydrophobic, so there

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.820
are some terminologies here.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.320
Whoops.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
Hydrophobic, which can also
be referred to as lipophilic.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.310
You either-- you can hate water
and love fatty acid or fatty

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.000
types of materials, so those
both terms are synonymous.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.380
And some of the lipids are
what are known as amphipathic,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.720
and they include hydrophobic
and hydrophobic components.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.780
There are a couple
of tiny terms that I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.910
didn't mention
explicitly, so I just

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.250
want to go ahead
and do that now.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.260
For example, in this
phospholipid structure--

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.560
and we'll talk about these--

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.510
they have long chain fatty
acids attached via esters

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.640
to this glycerol
unit, so there's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.310
one here and the
second one here,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.190
and then what's known
as the polar head group.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.030
In those fatty acids, they
could be fully saturated.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.750
It means they have no double
bonds in the structure,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:06.080
so that term saturated is
equivalent to no double bonds,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.289
so no carbon-carbon
double bonds.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.810
Or they could be
unsaturated, where

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.260
there is a double
bond within it,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.370
so that's one or
more double bonds.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.690
And those double bonds
take on a particular shape

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
because there's not freedom of
rotation around double bonds

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.080
the same way there is
around single bonds.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.330
So those single bonds,
you can twist them around

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.780
and twist them around, but the
double bond geometry is fixed.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.760
And so double bonds,
we refer to them

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.820
as either trans, where the two
groups are on opposite sides,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.760
leaving the double bond,
or we refer to them as cis,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.100
where the two groups
are on the same side.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.890
And we tend to use
that cis and trans

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.380
sort of naming system in a
lot of other contexts as well,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.020
but you almost always
want to remember

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.360
that trans is as far
away as possible,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.030
cis is closer than trans.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.750
All right, so I'm just
going to take you forward

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.400
to the phospholipid structure.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:21.730
This is a very important
semi-permeable membranes

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.320
are made up through the
non-covalent, supramolecular

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.340
association of
phospholipid monomer units.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.530
Here's a monomer unit up here.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.170
You see it has an
amphipathic structure,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.920
with a lot of hydrophobicity
but also hydrophilicity,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.870
and these molecules assemble
into supramolecular structures

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.630
that form the boundaries
of your cells.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.080
Saying they are semi-permeable
tells us a little bit

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.510
about what can go through them.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.187
If they were fully permeable,
anything could come and go

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:56.770
and they wouldn't
be much use frankly.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.990
It's like leaving the
door open the whole time.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.300
But because they're
semi-permeable,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.870
only a few things can come
and go without extra help,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.080
and other things need active
mechanisms to go through.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.620
So let's take a look
at the boundary here.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.268
So when you see a
membrane bilayer,

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:17.560
they are-- they're often
shown looking like this, where

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.440
every one of these
units is a phospholipid,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.620
and there's water on both
sides of the phospholipid,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.100
because that polar head
group is interacting

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.140
with water on both sides.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.380
So down here could be
the inside of the cell.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.960
Up here could be the
outside of the cell.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.180
And a lot of cells,
especially eukaryotic cells,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.830
the ones that make us up,
have a lot of endomembranes,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.240
membranes within the cells.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.020
For example, forming the
boundary to the nucleus

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.710
or to the mitochondria.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.544
Yes?

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:52.210
AUDIENCE: Why is
there a [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.230
PROFESSOR: Oh,
this guy must be--

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.180
so this looks like it's
probably a saturated fatty acid.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.450
So what do you think
this one might be, folks?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.380
Unsaturated.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.060
And what's the
double-bond geometry?

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.170
AUDIENCE: Cis.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.180
PROFESSOR: Cis.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.760
Yeah, it is.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.280
It's like a-- it looks like
a ballerina or something.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.210
OK, so we have a
lot of concerns,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.630
and we'll see later about how
things get in and out of cells.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:26.050
But most commonly, things
like oxygen or water

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.440
and other small
hydrophobic molecules

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.400
can pass readily in and out
through the semi-permeable

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.340
barrier, but other things,
things that are charged,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.220
things that are big, need
a different mechanism

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.120
to get in and out.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.750
And we will see later
on how proteins provide

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.480
the opportunities
to cargo things

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.770
into cells or out of cells,
even very large entities,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.810
and there are certain
mechanisms whereby

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.650
that happens through a
semi-permeable membrane, OK?

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.800
I want to show you the
other feature of membranes.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.137
They are self-healing.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.250
What this means is
if you poke them,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.700
you poke a hole in a
cellular membrane, You?

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.600
Basically push apart
those non-covalent forces.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.150
Once you take the thing
away, be it a needle

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.710
or a very fine glass capillary,
they seal right back up

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.690
to close to close the
hole in the cell wall,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.950
so that kind of tells us that
they're non-covalent forces.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.500
So this is a really
cool video of someone

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.130
doing micro-injection
into eukaryotic cells.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.520
The needle points to the
cell, approaches the surface.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.590
You can drop something
into the cell,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.080
and then the cell
closes and maintain--

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.840
regains its integrity
of the barrier,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.670
so this is a very
cool observation.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.140
People do this.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.060
They have to not
drink too much coffee

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.910
because it's quite complicated
to do a lot of micro-injection,

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.750
because you can really cause
carnage in your cell population

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.590
if you're not very dexterous
with the micro-injection

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.900
but people can be
very good at it.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.830
So I just want to ask
a couple of questions

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.550
before, give you a couple
of things to think about

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.200
before we close up.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200
The lipids.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.500
So here's a typical
lipid bilayer,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.140
where I've highlighted
a single lipid.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.390
And the colors, those
are the head groups,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.520
and all in white and gray are
the hydrophilic components,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.970
and just one of the
phospholipids is highlighted,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.670
and that would be this
molecular structure here.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.480
So first of all, what do you
think the non-covalent forces

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.210
at that membrane
interface may be?

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.810
That is, what's going on
here at the interface?

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.790
What are the types
of interactions

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.760
that you might have there?

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.650
Give you a minute
to think about it,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.960
and I want to show you that
I'm actually giving you

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.800
a clue here, because you can see
the structure, negative charge,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.990
positive charge,
but also remember

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.130
this is a barrier to water, so
there are other things going on

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.160
with the solvent that the
membrane is sitting in

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.250
because there's water
surrounding that barrier layer.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.740
Anyone want to tell me what
the answer is, and why?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.168
Yeah, did you-- are you-- yeah.

00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:21.380
AUDIENCE: Hydrogen bonding.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.596
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
between what and what?

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:37.409
AUDIENCE: Like the
oxygen and [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.230
PROFESSOR: Right, so water.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.659
Water is a good hydrogen
bond donor and acceptor,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.670
so there will be
hydrogen bonding.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.650
What about amongst
all those lipid

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.405
head groups, what's
the other major force?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.300
Yeah?

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.582
AUDIENCE: Electrostatic force.

00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.290
PROFESSOR: Between
the different charges.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.600
So the correct answer
here is both of them.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.660
Don't think it's just
electrostatic, it's both.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.380
It's electrostatic amongst the
head groups, hydrogen bonding

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.680
between all that sort of dense
bunch of charge, and the water.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.130
And then the other question,
what type of molecules

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.010
can get across?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.520
I've already answered
that question to you.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.730
Salts are going to need
ways to get in and out.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.840
Small proteins are too big
to dissolve in that membrane

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.270
through passive
mechanisms, so we're

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.150
going to have to figure
out how to get proteins

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.160
in and out of cells.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.560
Neurotransmitters,
such as this, this

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.500
is GABA, or gamma
aminobutyric acid.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.550
It's charged.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.400
It just can't get through
without a transporter

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.280
of some kind, and
it's actually proteins

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.160
that end up doing the heavy
lifting of the transport

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.950
processes that we'll see.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.990
OK, so moving along.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.550
This section will be about the
building blocks of your protein

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.590
macromolecules, which
I want to remind

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.670
you comprise 50% of all
of the macromolecules,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.640
so that suggests it's a
pretty important class

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.720
of macromolecules that has a
lot of different functions.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.460
Now, the amino acid
building locks--

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.440
blocks look pretty simple.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.050
They're called amino
acids because they

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:21.480
have an amine, the
carboxylic acid,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.600
and there's a carbon that
is tetrehedral between the

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.450
carboxylic acid and the amine.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.010
And the simplest of those is
when those are both hydrogen,

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.310
but most of the amino
acids are differentiated

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.830
from that-- this one I've
showed you on the board.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.690
This amino acid is glycine.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.920
Usually, when it's just a lonely
amino acid in aqueous solution,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.180
it's in a different
charged form,

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.650
just consistent with what we
talked about in the last class.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.890
And I put it here.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.480
So this is glycine.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.595
It's one of the 20
encoded amino acids.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.090
That means the
amino acids that are

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.510
made through
ribosomal biosynthesis

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.080
through a code that's
provided by the messenger RNA,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.800
so they are encoded
by messenger RNA.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.640
Later on, you'll see all
of the beautiful mechanics

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.330
of those processes.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.270
Now, this table looks
pretty complicated,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.830
so I'm going to
deconstruct it a bit.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.470
But what I first of all want
to assure you is that these--

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.870
you will always get a handout
with these structures on them.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.960
We are not asking you to
remember these structures.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.510
You might become familiar
with some of them,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.790
but you do not have
to remember them.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.670
You'll have a table that
shows them, but on that table,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.880
I won't necessarily
give you the information

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.730
on what their properties
are, because those are things

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.090
that you should be able to spot
by looking at their chemical

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.140
structures, all right?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.400
So that's important.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.430
So these are all
line-angled drawings,

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.020
so you see the carbon.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.120
The hydrogens aren't
shown in there.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.850
The charges are shown for
what's called the side

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:29.550
chain, because most of the
amino acids have a side chain.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.290
The amino acids are
also chiral, but you'll

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.830
learn more than you ever wanted
to know about chirality in 512,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.780
so I won't weigh you down
with any of those properties.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.320
So there is a side chain
that dictates the properties

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.920
of the amino acids.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.030
One tiny detail,
the amino acids that

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.970
are encoded in our
proteins are all what

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.120
are known as alpha amino acids.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.740
There are other amino acids.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.470
GABA, that I showed you
on the previous slide,

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.390
is not an alpha amino acid.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.820
Actually it's, a
gamma amino acid.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.320
These are called amino acids
because the amine group

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.722
is at the alpha position
relative to the carboxyl.

00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:16.930
Don't need to know a lot
more about that with respect

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.810
to that.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.830
So let's take a look at
this set of amino acids,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.490
and what you see is amino
side chains with rather

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.220
different properties.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.950
I've amassed-- here's
glycine at the very top.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.140
All amino acids have
a three-letter code

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.700
or a one-letter code.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.950
I particularly enjoy
using one letter codes

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.970
and spelling out people's
names in peptides and things

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.470
like that.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.640
I'll let you do that in the
privacy of your own room.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.180
It's kind of amusing to see if
your name actually spells out

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.350
a peptide.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.380
Some of us-- if I get a little
stopped stuck with Barbara

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.670
because there are no B amino
acid one letters with a B.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.090
The next most abundant
type of amino acid

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.300
have hydrophobic side chains.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.170
What that means is
they have a lot of CHs,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.710
but not a lot else, right?

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.290
So take a look at them.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:13.740
Alanine has a methyl group,
for example, where I've shown

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.730
the R, that would be alanine.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.500
And they get increasingly big.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.950
They're quite large.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.670
Some of them have quite
extended size chains.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.740
Other ones have side
chains with rings

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.360
with double bonds in them.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.780
Those are what we would
designate in organic chemistry

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.190
as aromatic.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.320
They show-- they are
still hydrophobic,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.250
but they show
different properties

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.210
to this other set
of amino acids.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.340
Some of these amino
acids may actually

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.330
have polar groups in them,
but their major feature

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.160
is that they're hydrophobic.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.830
But in an amino acid,
such as tyrosine,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.190
you could not only have
hydrophobic interactions

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.660
with that ring system, but also
hydrogen bonding with the OH

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.060
on the tyrosine, so
some of the amino acids

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.120
can do a few different things.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.130
The next set of
amino acids are those

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.920
that are polar and
charged, and I've

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.120
shown you the most common state
of all of those amino acids,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.670
but you already know
that the amine of lysine

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.500
is likely to be charged.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.680
This quanidinium group of
arginine, take my word for it,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.660
it's charged.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.820
It's a bit more
complicated to draw.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.010
Histidine is also one of
those that's annoying to draw,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.370
but the negatively-charged
side chains with a carboxylate

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.590
are both negatively
charged, and that's

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.230
something you would remember
from the previous class

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.190
hopefully.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.930
And then finally,
there are amino acids

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.360
with polar uncharged
side chains,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.140
such as those shown here.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.190
Now, this doesn't look
like a very exciting set

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.120
of building blocks.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.800
How can life run on things
made of 20 relatively

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.460
simple building blocks
with functional groups?

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.870
And it's that the building
blocks are not functional

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.110
themselves.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:02.680
It is the polymers that
are made up of amino acids,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.830
and I'll always call them AAs
because it's easier for me.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.760
The polymers of amino
acids are heteropolymers.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.660
That means they're made up of
a bunch of different monomer

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.760
units when they're
called heteropolymers.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.770
And the other important
thing about these polymers

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.600
is that they are of
defined sequence.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.270
What is the sequence?

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.510
It's the order in which
the amino acids appear.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.430
So I'm writing that down, order.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.100
And all the
functions of proteins

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.010
are dictated by the
order of the amino acids,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.630
so let's take a look
at the sidebar here.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.290
So once again, remember
a couple of things

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.510
that we will always give you
this table to think about.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.967
Ooh, come back.

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:03.550
There are a couple of outliers
I just want to mention quickly.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.920
So I talked to
you about glycine,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.819
the simplest amino acid with
no elaborate side chain.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.260
Proline is a little odd because
its side chain is kind of

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.210
in a cyclic structure, and
towards the end of the class,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.480
I'll talk to you about
collagen, whose structure

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.109
is totally dependent on
the involvement of proline

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:27.160
in the sequence of the amino
acids that make up collagen.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.480
And then the last sorts of
unusual amino acid is cysteine.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.180
It has a thiol, and the one
clever thing about cysteine--

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.890
I'm just going to put a
bit of a peptide here.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:49.640
One cysteine, and then I'm
going to put a second cysteine,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:55.120
and these are going to be
deemed in a peptidic structure.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.630
What cysteine can do
is it can exist either

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:03.130
with the thiol side
chain, SH, or it

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.280
can be at a different
oxidation state

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:12.290
where the two sulfurs
are joined to each other.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.240
So for the most part,
your linear arrangement

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.530
of amino acids that dictates
sequence is solely held by--

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.370
together by the covalent
bonds and the peptide backbone

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.360
that we'll talk
about in a minute.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.900
But occasionally,
enfolded structures,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.540
if two cysteines are
close to each other

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.430
and the environment
is oxidizing,

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.140
they will form a cross-link.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.240
But they're not
what drives folding.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.490
They kind of fall
into place later on,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.130
but that just sort of sets
cysteine apart a little bit

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.830
for its properties, all right?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.000
OK, so coming down
the side here.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.350
Amino acids are assembled
in a unique linear polymer

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.650
of defined order, and we
designate that defined

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.855
sequence the primary sequence.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:09.850
And proteins can be 1,000 amino
acids, 1,500, 100 amino acids.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:17.910
They can be various lengths
where they, you know,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.400
we would generally
consider the smallest

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.960
protein to be about
400 amino acids,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.270
and you might go up to
thousands of amino acids.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.390
I'm going to write
2,000 or more here.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.570
When the proteins
are smaller, they

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.400
are not capable of adopting
too much ordered structure,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.240
and we mostly call
them peptides.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.820
Peptides are sort of
shorter sequences,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.260
so peptide sequences.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:54.640
So this would be a protein,
and peptides, probably two

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.740
to 39 amino acids,
but these breakpoints

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.990
are a little bit more vague.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.077
So the primary sequence
will define the structure

00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:05.660
of a protein, and
we're going to start

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.600
to talk about the hierarchical
structure of proteins

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.320
as put in place, and that's
the primary sequence,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.950
And that primary sequence
is kind of a cool thing

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.050
because it's very specific.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.950
It defines-- it's got
encoded into its structure,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.820
the three-dimensional
fold of the protein, OK?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.630
All the information for the
folded, compact, globular

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.320
structure that's
functional is encoded

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.240
in that primary sequence.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.890
It's a cryptic code.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.830
We may not be able to
tell by looking at it

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.800
what it really looks like,
but all the information

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.080
is there in order to program
the folding into a globular

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.220
structure.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.950
So the primary sequence
determines the fold,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.060
and it's the fold of the protein
that mandates its function.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.830
It's not the sequence
of the protein.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.930
The sequence defines the fold.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.730
The fold, the three-dimensional
form, defines the function, OK?

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.900
So that's very important.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.420
And I think it's
absolutely amazing

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.510
that with a relatively limited
set of building blocks,

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.830
we can define so many different
functions of all the proteins

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.290
in our body that
may be structural,

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.900
they may be catalysts,
they may be things

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.570
that transfer information
from the outside

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.130
to the inside of cell.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.570
All of that is programmed
with this rather limited set

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.440
of building blocks, OK?

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.400
Now, let's now
talk about peptides

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.500
because one gets a
little frustrated

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.450
looking at single amino acids.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.330
They don't tell us so much
about the peptidic structure,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.620
so I'm going to draw
two amino acids,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.970
and then I'm going to tell
you one important thing.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.870
So let's put R1, and I'm going
to draw another amino acid,

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.840
and I'm putting it in a
particular orientation.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:07.850
R2, because that
designates that these

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.990
might be different amino acids.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.270
For example, if R1 is H, there's
an implied hydrogen here,

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.070
that would be glycine.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.460
If R2 is a methyl group, there's
an implied hydrogen there,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.770
that would be
alanine, all right?

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:26.990
When nature bonds all
these amino acids together,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:33.940
it carries out a
condensation reaction

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.290
to form a peptide
bond between these two

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.410
components of the
amino acid, the amine

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.275
and the carboxylic acid.

00:22:44.275 --> 00:22:47.840
And now I'm going to draw you
the first of the dipeptides

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.880
that you'll meet.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.720
And there are so many
things to tell you

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.120
about these
structures, it sort of

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.035
drives me crazy
thinking about, oh, I

00:22:57.035 --> 00:22:58.660
must remember to tell
them that or I've

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.180
got to remember to tell them
that, because the structures

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:01.720
are cool.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.150
R1, R2.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:11.763
OK, so this is a
dipeptide, two amino acids,

00:23:11.763 --> 00:23:13.180
and there are some
characteristics

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.740
I want you to remember.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:23.570
When we write out peptides,
we always write them N to C.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:33.200
So in that peptide, this would
be the carboxyl terminus,

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.000
and this would be
the amino terminus.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.890
If you don't always remember
to write things in this order,

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.980
and you tell your friend,
oh, go and get this peptide

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.990
made, and you put it
down in the wrong order,

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.910
they'll make the wrong peptide.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.030
So you always-- there is
basically an agreement

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.450
amongst everyone that we always
write from left to right,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.340
the sequence of peptides.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.500
The next important thing
about this structure,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.660
as you look at it, there
are several bonds joining

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.030
the polymeric structure.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.500
Many of these bonds
show free rotations.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.420
You can twist them
around, there's nothing

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.830
stopping that conversion.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.780
All of these show
freedom of rotation.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:29.030
But the amide, or
peptide bond, is

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.070
unique in that
there's restricted

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.180
rotation about that bond.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.360
So it's as if you've
got a linear polymer,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.780
but every third bond
has kind of stuck

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.000
in a particular
orientation, which

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.350
starts to define a lot of
details about protein tertiary

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.190
structure.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.647
It's not complete spaghetti.

00:24:48.647 --> 00:24:51.230
It's like spaghetti with little
bits that haven't been cooked.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.040
They're stiffer than the
rest of the sequence.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.640
And the other really
important thing

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.370
about the peptide
structure is that embedded

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:05.710
within that structure, there is
the amide or peptide functional

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:15.320
group where, remember, this can
be a hydrogen bond acceptor,

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.340
and this can be a
hydrogen bond donor.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.940
Once you know that, the next few
slides will make a lot of sense

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.155
as we talk about higher-order
structure of proteins.

00:25:25.155 --> 00:25:26.530
So let's just take
a look at that

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.870
with a slightly longer peptide.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.600
By convention, if I'm
going to draw a peptide

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.160
that's methionine
isoleucine threonine--

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.500
you can look up that names--

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.180
those names on the chart--

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.490
that would be the MIT peptide.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.740
These are the three amino acids.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.430
I'm going to condense
them into a tripeptide.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.240
When I condense
three amino acids,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.510
I spit out two
molecules of water,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:54.430
and I put in place two
amide or peptide bonds.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.420
If I go down this
backbone, every third bond

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.440
is going to be
fixed, fairly fixed.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.950
There's not freedom
of rotation around it,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.190
and every third bond is
going to have the capacity

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.580
to be involved in hydrogen
bonding interactions,

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.610
as I've suggested
here, all right?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.350
What else is there here?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.090
When I write the MIT
peptide, I write M first,

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.730
I second, T third.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.450
If I wrote TIM, it would be a
completely different chemical

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.940
structure with different
chemical properties,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.600
so the directionality is
important to understand,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.290
and there you have it.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.170
So now you can go home
and practice your name

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.840
in amino acids
and draw them out.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.560
If you draw them out
fairly sort of sharply,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.290
then you'll never get
confused about what

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.883
end's what and where
the substitutes are,

00:26:46.883 --> 00:26:48.550
but it's important
to remember as you're

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.640
making a dipeptide-- oops,
I forget this doesn't work.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.770
As you're condensing
a dipeptide,

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.110
when you're putting these
R groups on, one goes up,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.300
one goes down, but
these are nuances

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.700
of the structure that
may be lit for-- good

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.290
for a later discussion.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.760
So here is now a longer linear
peptide, and the suggestion

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.400
of a globular structure
that might be found

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.970
if that peptide was folded up.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:20.850
And the primary sequence here
defines the globular structure,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.330
and the process whereby you
go from the extended primary

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:29.530
sequence to the folded structure
is called protein folding.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.470
And physical chemists
and physicists

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.380
and computational
chemists have for years

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.060
tried to understand how we could
predict the folded structure

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.190
from the primary sequence.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.130
It's not simple because
what you're doing

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.210
is you're solving a
massive energy diagram,

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.170
where as you fold
a structure up,

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:02.090
you're trying to maximize
all those non-covalent forces

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:06.920
for maximum thermodynamic
stability, right?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.950
It's kind of a three-dimensional
puzzle where you're

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.510
trying to have as
many hydrogen bonds,

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.650
electrostatic interactions,
and so on, as you can possibly

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:16.460
make.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.090
So when computational
chemists try to fold proteins,

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.940
they're basically solving
a three-dimensional puzzle

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.720
where they are
maximizing interactions.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.850
And there are a lot of ab
initio and molecular dynamics

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:34.010
programs that are now starting
to be able to fold proteins

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.890
into fairly reliable structures,
but they don't always

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.370
get them right
because they haven't

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.810
gotten all the clues yet.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.500
And also while they may
be able to do ab initio

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.830
or computational folding
with small structures,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.990
the headache gets way bigger
the larger the structures get.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.370
So the predictors aren't
very good at predicting

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.620
big structures,
they're getting better

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.720
at predicting small structures.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:05.870
And so just to reinforce to
you, the primary sequence

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.710
is established by covalent
bonds, the peptide bonds,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.200
but the globular
tertiary structure

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.920
is based on non-covalent
covalent interactions, OK?

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.870
Now, I want to ask you this.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.390
I love cartoons with
science in them,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.910
but you know, 10%, 20% of
the time, they make mistakes,

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.430
and I felt this one was
particularly pertinent.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.490
So a bunch of guys lugging
around in a lab and says,

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.700
well, we finished
the genome map,

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.147
now we just have to
figure out how to fold it.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:38.480
What is wrong with that cartoon?

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.470
What fold?

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.072
Yeah?

00:29:43.072 --> 00:29:44.530
AUDIENCE: You want
to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.197
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:45.197 --> 00:29:46.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
genome doesn't fold.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.660
It's double helical,
duplex DNA or something.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.260
You're actually
folding proteins,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.960
so the cartoon is
not quite right,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.790
but it's sort of kind of cute.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.360
All right, now, when we talk
about the non-covalent forces

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.490
that hold proteins
together, I just

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.440
want you to remember
from last time

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.370
this set of non-covalent forces,
because if you understand them

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.810
and recognize them, you'll
understand how they may occur

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.070
in folded protein structures.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.190
All right, so here's
a peptide sequence.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.190
Here's a puzzle for you.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.990
You can go back and figure out
what the one-letter code spells

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.280
there.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.500
Just take out your table
with all the amino acids.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.790
It's appended to the
back of your P-set,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:33.020
and you'll be able to see what
that very large peptide spells.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.770
All right, I don't
want you working it out

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.290
while you're here.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.270
You've got to listen to
me for the time being.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:47.050
OK, so the first order, we get
it, there's a primary sequence.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.380
The next thing to
think about is what's

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.510
known as secondary structure.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.780
It's a higher order than
just the primary sequence,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:05.600
and it's established
by non-covalent bonds,

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.810
and it's called secondary--
oof, my writing's horrid today.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.420
Secondary structure.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:26.530
And those are interactions that
are put in place exclusively

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:31.090
by interactions between
the peptide bonds of what's

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.220
known as the peptide backbone.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.490
So if I look at the structure,
these are the side chains.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.320
The peptide backbone is this
continuous linear sequence.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.840
That's what we would call
the peptide backbone,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.450
and the secondary
structure is put in place

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.750
by hydrogen bonding
between components

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.370
of the peptide backbone.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.890
So for example,
a hydrogen bonds,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:32:02.810
such as that, or a different
hydrogen bonding interaction,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.680
such as that.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.300
Between the atoms that have
lone pairs of electrons

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.640
and the other atoms--

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.180
heavy atoms that hold a
hydrogen that's quite acidic.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.050
And there are a couple of major
forms of secondary structure.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.300
What I'm showing
you here is what's

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.910
known as the alpha helix.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.660
First deduced by Pauling, in
fact, through model building,

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.230
he said, proteins could form
these ordered structures,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:34.520
and an alpha helix is an ordered
structure exclusively made up

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.470
from the hydrogen-bonding
interactions

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.130
of the peptide backbone.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.640
And you can look at
this helical structure.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.060
It's a continuous
strand of peptide,

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:50.510
but there are hydrogen bonds
between COs and NHs all the way

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.530
through the backbone, such
that this strand of peptide

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.190
can fold up into a cylindrical,
helical structure, where

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.655
all those R groups, the side
chains of the amino acids,

00:33:01.655 --> 00:33:04.550
are on the perimeter
of that helix.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:08.930
So this secondary structure
is an important one

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.830
because it's very prevalent
in a lot of proteins.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.030
The next secondary structure
is also held together

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.180
by hydrogen bonding,
and it's interactions

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.140
between stretched out strands
of peptides that may not

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.690
be close to each other
in the primary sequence,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.750
but they align in
the folded structure.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.280
And so for example,
what I've shown

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.380
you here is what's known as a--

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.330
this guy is then to say this
is an anti-parallel beta sheet.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.470
And across that sheet, there
are continuous opportunities

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.690
for hydrogen
bonding interaction.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.350
If the strands run in opposite
directions, it's anti-parallel.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.930
If they're in the same
direction, it's parallel.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:57.220
These two secondary
structure elements

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.130
make up a lot of
the sort of basics

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.050
of how proteins start to fold.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.830
They're key non-covalent
forces, and there are also

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.870
other smaller motifs.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:14.739
One is called a beta turn,
where the peptide sequence may

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.040
go through a chain
reversal, so the sequence

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.030
would look like this.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.488
I'm going to just
draw it, and I'll

00:34:20.488 --> 00:34:24.560
talk to you in a moment
about ribbon diagrams.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.560
And this piece here
would be the turn,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.108
whereas that would be
the interactions enforced

00:34:30.108 --> 00:34:30.650
by the sheet.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.409
These are the ordered elements
of secondary structure.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.840
You don't have to be
able to figure them out,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.659
but you have to be
able to pick them out

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.679
in order to understand
the structure, OK?

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.159
So even those simple
elements still

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.190
it's hard to make big enough
structures to have functions.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.480
So as I mentioned in a
continuation of the theme,

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.540
the protein folding
is hierarchical,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.650
you can start to put together
elements of secondary structure

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.990
to make things that
are a little larger.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.780
Helix, turn, helix.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.180
Helix with a different
kind of turn,

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.650
maybe put in place by a metal
ion or something, or a strand,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.020
turn, strand, or
now something that's

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:20.180
a composite of these two major
types of secondary structure,

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.840
the helix and the turn.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.960
And these really
start to be proteins

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.290
that might be big enough
to be able to do something,

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.750
but they're all
exclusively held together

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.940
by non-covalent forces between
the amides or peptide bonds

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.580
in the backbone of
the protein, OK?

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.690
Not very exciting just yet.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.570
Now, one other little
clue that people will--

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.730
you might see and you
might be confused,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.800
people sometimes, when
they're drawing sort

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.520
of a quick picture of a protein,
they might draw a helix,

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.890
but instead of really
showing it in detail,

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.510
they might show
it as a cylinder,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:59.910
so you might need to pick
that out of a structure.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.620
And then I want to call
your attention to that,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:07.370
that in all those motifs, when
you join one helix to another,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.090
you might need to turn a
strand to another strand you

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.650
need to turn, and so on.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.730
OK, so this is like taking
your very extended stored

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.850
of polymer, knowing there are
different kinks in it, because

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.490
of the backbone bonds,
but folding it up

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.510
in a structure that
maximizes the opportunity

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.540
for another order of structure,
which we'll talk about now.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.770
All right, so
we've seen primary.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.285
Secondary is just with backbone.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.660
And things start to get
much more interesting

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.240
when we get to
tertiary structure,

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.420
because tertiary
structure is enabled

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.740
by all these other interactions,
electrostatic, hydrogen

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.050
bonding, hydrophobic
forces, that

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.780
can be put in place
due to the side

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.402
chains of amino acids
interacting with each other

00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:02.735
or with the backbone structures.

00:37:02.735 --> 00:37:05.580
So I'm going to walk you through
this, so you can sort of get

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.520
a sense of how these
three-dimensional puzzles work

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.110
on a very small scale.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.430
So look here, that's
a very small motif.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.440
And what I'm going to
call your attention to

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.630
is when you fold
up these motifs,

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.640
when the secondary
structure is in place,

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.340
a lot of the side chains
are near each other,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.400
and they can engage in
long-distance contacts.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.190
And so for example,
I'm going to show you

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.650
interactions
between side chains,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.260
between side chains and
the peptide backbone,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.030
or side chains and water.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.280
But what I want to do is
take a look at this and see,

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.310
can you put any of those
potential interactions

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.250
on the drawing that's
on your handout?

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.140
It's pretty obvious
where there's

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.782
an electrostatic
interaction, right?

00:37:49.782 --> 00:37:50.730
Boop.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.430
OK, between plus-- get
those out of the way,

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.750
those are the easy ones.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.830
And then interactions
between hydrophobic groups,

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.380
where they want to amass
that lipophilic structure,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.380
so it's not exposed
as much to water,

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.960
so they cluster,
so those are easy.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.470
And then you can start thinking
about what are all of hydrogen

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.270
bonds you could draw.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.440
Here I've shown one
between side chains,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.270
between side chains
and backbone,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.180
between side chains and
water, and those may all

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.110
contribute to the ultimate
thermodynamic stability.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.030
Make sure you get your
hydrogen bonds right.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.240
Remember, two donors don't
interact with each other

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.680
into acceptors, don't--

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.420
so this might describe
the folding possibilities

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.190
of that small motif.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.376
Now what I want to show you--

00:38:40.376 --> 00:38:41.980
I'm going to-- let me--

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.260
is an ab-initio simulation
of a folding process.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.350
So let me just get that a
little bigger on the screen.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.190
So this is computing.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:01.720
GB1 is a very small protein
that holds reversibly

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.380
under appropriate conditions,
and what I'm going to do

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.050
is forward you
through this video.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.440
This is a simulation.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.840
This is all computation.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.350
It's not looking at anything
by spectroscopy or in solution

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.370
or anything like that.

00:39:19.053 --> 00:39:21.220
And what I'm going to do
is I'm going to forward you

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.870
through the structure.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.750
This is multi-scale modeling.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:28.110
It's got a lot of
details in how it's done,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.530
but the starting point is
a very denatured protein,

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.450
all stretched out, right?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.570
And what I'm going to do is
just show you for a few seconds,

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.100
you know, this
thing's like trying

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.540
to find its
thermodynamic minimum,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.360
and it's actually
failing pretty badly.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.390
And it does that for about 30--

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.200
60 seconds of the simulations,
so I made a point to myself

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.260
to take you to about minute
one, where things start

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.475
to get fairly interesting.

00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:55.770
And you're saying, well,
what's interesting about that?

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.760
You see that nascent helix,
in the background, the red

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.430
and the blue, is starting
to form strands that

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.170
are a little bit
aligned, and it's

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.530
trying to find as many
connections as possible

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.660
to satisfy a stable structure.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.420
At a certain point
in the simulation,

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.720
five of the hydrophobic
groups are in a little pea.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.180
They're in a little
hydrophobic cluster,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.370
and that's a breakpoint
in the folding process,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.100
because that gets everything
glued together better,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.310
so that the rest
of it now can start

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:30.270
to really find its final
place in the folded structure.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.360
These early structures are
known as molten globules.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.270
A lot of the interactions
are not yet in place,

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.610
but the hydrophobic
cluster is critical.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.710
But then after
that, it's almost as

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.110
if you're sliding
downhill to get

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:47.110
all the remaining interactions
in place to fold the protein,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.850
OK?

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.150
So protein folding
is a puzzle that

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.390
can be solved
computationally by maximizing

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.340
thermodynamic interactions.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.990
So it's sigma this, sum of
this, sum of this, sum of that.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.720
That's going to get difficult
the larger the protein gets,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.110
but for small proteins,
those simulations really

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.020
start to make sense, OK?

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.450
All right, so let's
just move on here.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.478
Lost-- ah, good.

00:41:14.478 --> 00:41:16.020
What did you think
of the simulation?

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.250
It's kind of cool, right?

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.480
So you can find the
link in the sidebar.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.030
So just pop these back
on now, and that's

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.350
the folded structure.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.630
All right, so with
many proteins,

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.250
they're much more
complex than that.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.640
So for example, here's cyclin
A. It's involved in cell cycle,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.860
and you can see its alpha
helix structure dominantly,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.860
very clearly, all those
beautiful alpha helices.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.800
Next to it is the green
fluorescent protein,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.440
which is a cylindrical
structure made up

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.510
of anti-parallel beta sheets.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.610
What's really cool is when
you sort of rotate it,

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.470
you can see all those
sheets, but then it

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.590
does this little sort of
curtsy to the audience,

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.200
and you can look
down into the barrel.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.560
And then in some
cases, proteins may

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.020
be a mixture of a secondary
structure elements.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.580
Here it's a little hard to tell.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.800
This is triose
phosphate isomerase,

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.630
but if you look down it,
you can see the helices,

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.890
and there's also a group of beta
strands that are held together.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.390
So in that protein, it's a
mixture of alpha helix and beta

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.130
sheet.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.890
Now, I'm not going to tell
you much about pulling up

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:26.380
Protein Data Bank files
right now because I

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.955
want to cover the next topic.

00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:29.830
And then when we have
a few minutes later on,

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.850
I'll show you.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.250
But wherever I show
you a structure,

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.190
I'm trying to show you the
Protein Data Bank code,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.220
and in the web site,
you can see there

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.250
is a free download
of PyMOL, which

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.490
is the program I used to
create all these structures

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.740
and movies, so you can
really look at things.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.677
And believe me, it took
me about three years

00:42:49.677 --> 00:42:51.010
to learn how to use it properly.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.530
It'll probably take you about a
week or maybe a couple of days.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.610
So if I can learn it, you
can certainly learn it.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.460
Now, there is one final
element of protein structure

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.070
that people get
kind of hung up on,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.760
and it's what's called
quaternary structure.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.250
It's like, aren't we done yet?

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.300
So in addition to all
of these, let's say

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:19.320
I have a folded motif,
and there's its structure.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.480
That would be have primary,
secondary, between the strands

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.840
or the helix, and
tertiary structure, right?

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:34.840
But in some cases, proteins
hold up to quaternary structure,

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:43.340
where it's multiple of these
units joined together--

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.860
hoo, I could have
picked a simpler fold,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.740
but that will get you
the general gist of it--

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.190
all right, where these
are actually associated

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.200
by non-covalent forces.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.110
So there's more than
one polypeptide chain.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.550
In fact, here would be four
peptide chains coming together

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.290
in a higher-order
structure that's

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:07.540
made up of four of those units.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.170
The prototypic example
of this is the protein

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.720
that carries oxygen around
in your blood, which

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:19.150
is hemoglobin, and it has
four primary sequences

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:24.090
that have come together
in a tetrameric quaternary

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.360
structure.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.230
Hemoglobin is kind
of interesting,

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.330
because it's made up of two
alpha and two beta subunits.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.330
If All these subunits
were identical,

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:37.210
they would be called
homooligomers,

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.830
all the same pieces.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.230
If they are different, they
are called heterooligomers.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.080
We'll see a little
bit more about this

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.900
when I talk about hemoglobin
in the next class,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.260
because the features of
the quaternary structure

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.890
are very, very important for
the proper transport of oxygen,

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.800
and single mutations can
really mess things up,

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.010
and you'll see more about
that in the next class.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.030
So just wrap that
little bit up, proteins

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.460
are condensation
polymers of amino acids.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:12.370
Each protein sequence is
defined by covalent bonding.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:13.660
Native proteins.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.460
Most of them that are not have
quite quaternary structure

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.370
are folded through secondary
and tertiary interactions,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.630
these things that we
already talked about,

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.790
and folding is defined
by how to maximize

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.860
all those non-covalent
forces to get

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.100
the maximum
thermodynamic stability

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.230
with the maximum
number of interactions.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.930
And subunits may
also come together

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.830
through quaternary structure.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.550
OK, so I'm going to talk to
you about several proteins

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.770
throughout the
course, but for now, I

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.890
want to focus you in on
a structural protein that

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.190
provides mechanical
support for tissues.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.240
In the next class, we'll talk
about transporters and enzymes,

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.340
and as we move on
to signaling, things

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.680
like receptors and membrane
proteins and so on.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.970
So the protein I'm going to
describe to you is collagen.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.550
It is the most abundant
protein in the human body.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:10.920
It plays enormous roles.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.200
It's not an enzyme,
it's not a catalyst,

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.550
it's not a transporter.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.370
It is one of those
structural proteins, where

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.010
the structure of
collagen has evolved

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.220
to provide a mechanical
stability to lots

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.640
of essential components
of complex organisms.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.200
And there are many
different types

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.410
of collagens that are found in
different parts of the body.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.940
For example, bone, tendon,
cartilage, and so on.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.560
They are all college
and structures,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.050
but they have
subtle differences,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.390
maybe some have different,
slightly different,

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.540
mechanical properties to
adapt to the functions

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.860
that they perform, OK?

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.540
And what I'm going to show you
is that a single amino acid

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.020
change in the primary
sequence of collagen

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.380
can destabilize the structure,
so it is no longer viable.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.440
And the disease type
I'm going to talk to you

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.980
about is a set of diseases
known as collagenopathies,

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:10.440
and the particular one is
called osteogenesis imperfecta.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.980
Osteo always refers to
bone because college

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.490
and plays a critical role
in the structure of bone.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:22.410
Bone isn't just bone, it's
collagen involved in it.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.940
And it's also this disease is
called brittle bone syndrome.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.880
And here's the X-ray of a
baby born with brittle bones

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.480
syndrome, and you'll see that
the long bones in the upper arm

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.750
are all irregular because
the bones are brittle,

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:40.580
and they'll break even in utero.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.980
A lot of babies with
this defect can't even

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.730
be born through the
birth canal because it

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:47.700
would crush the bones,
and many of them

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.680
don't survive very long at all.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.410
Some survive with
different kinds of cases,

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.120
but their lives are
greatly impacted,

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.400
and they could just
sort of hit a table

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.590
and the bones would
break, all right?

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.020
There are those sort
of serious situations

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:05.590
where parents are actually
accused of abuse to the child,

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.490
but the child actually
had brittle bone syndrome,

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:11.460
and it was just through helping
them put their clothes on

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.600
or taking them upstairs, the
bones got broken very readily.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.300
So osteogenesis
imperfecta really

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.510
describes a collection
of these defects.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:26.640
Now the collagen tertiary
structure is shown here.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.290
It's actually made up
of a type of helix.

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.060
It's not an alpha helix.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.740
It's a polyproline helix,
where the individual subunits

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.830
in that tertiary in the
structure are fairly long

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.070
and extended, and I
show you three strands

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:45.420
in this polymeric structure,
a yellow, a red, and a green.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.290
And these rolled together
into a three helix bundle that

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.680
has a fibrillous structure,
and then all these structures

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.310
come together to make the
macromolecular structure that

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.260
is collagen.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.400
It's not just one
of those fibrils.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.740
It's bundles of those fibrils in
a very organized pattern where

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.770
you could even see that
patterning in electron

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.030
microscopy.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.660
And there are many genetic
defects of collagen,

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.710
and what's so important
to think about

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.620
is if you have a
defect in one strand

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.790
that defect will propagate
through every single strand.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:26.130
If this is one strand made up
of three polypeptide chains,

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.070
it propagates all the way
through the structure.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.700
And I believe I have little
time to just show you,

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.980
here's the collagen structure.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.050
I'm just showing you
how it's extended.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.480
Those are three
independent strands,

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.720
and there's a set of magenta
residues in the middle, which

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.210
come from a defect
in the sequence

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.800
where a glycine has been
changed to an alanine.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.260
So I'm going to show you
this movie because it shows

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.990
you right at the center
of the structure, there

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.420
are residues painted in pink.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.260
And what I'm going to do is show
you close up of that segment.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.270
If you look at
those cells they're

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.920
all nicely organized,
except where that defect is,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.930
and that defect is caused
by the change of a hydrogen

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:14.640
to a methyl group on three
residues that come together,

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.000
and that bulges out that
fibrillous structure

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.490
and makes it not as
compact and beautiful

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:24.113
as it should be in the version
that's got the glycine there.

00:50:24.113 --> 00:50:25.530
So if you look at
it, you can even

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.250
see that helix gets
bulged out and it's not

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.970
as well-aligned as the
rest of the structure.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.430
And then that defect
gets propagated

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:39.870
into all the fibrils and results
in the weakening of the bones.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.720
Either the collagen
fails to form properly,

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.550
or the collagen,
when it forms, it

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.080
has much less
mechanical stability.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.830
So I think that's a
good place to stop

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:53.520
and I'll pick up next
time with hemoglobin.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.190
Oh, one last little thing, a
couple of things for you to do.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.860
There's a great link on the
website to the Protein Data

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.490
Bank to see how enzymes work.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.280
And if you have
a little time, it

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.620
would be awesome
if you could just

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.590
take a quick flick through
those parts of the text.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.680
These slides are posted with
these reading assignments,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.180
and they're posted in color if
you want to look at them again.

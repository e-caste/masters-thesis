00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.720
PROFESSOR: What we
have to do today

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:35.080
is study a very important
example of a two- state system.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.090
That will be the
ammonia molecule,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.555
and will lead us to
understand how masers work.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.660
Masers are what for
microwaves, the same thing

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.450
as lasers are for light-- it's
just a different frequency.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.560
Masers is microwaves
and lasers is for light.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.710
It's the same thing.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.020
So it's a very nice application
of two-state systems.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.560
And then we'll discuss over
the last part of the lecture

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.230
some aspects of nuclear
magnetic resonance.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.600
I don't think I'll
get to the end of it,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.770
because it's quite
a bit of material.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.040
But we'll try to
see what we can do.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.410
So let me remind you
of the last thing

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.050
we were doing last
time, that this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.220
is going to be in the
backdrop of what we do today.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.130
We spoke about Hamiltonians
for a two-state system that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.910
were the most general two by
two Hermitian matrix specified

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.500
by four real numbers-- g0
and the three components

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.510
of the vector g multiplied
by the Pauli matrices.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.460
This is Hermitian.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.890
This can be written in this
way, in which we've identified

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.700
Hamiltonians for spins, in
the sense that g dot sigma--

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.169
really, sigma is
proportional to S,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.130
so this is equal to
omega dot S, where

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.430
omega-- Larmor--
is 2g over h bar.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.215
And we explained last time
that if you have a term omega l

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:32.130
dot S, spins will rotate
with angular velocity omega l

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.420
vector, which means they
rotate around the axis defined

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.990
by the vector omega l,
with an angular velocity

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.240
equal to the magnitude
of the vector omega l.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.490
So that's Larmor precession.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.390
This Larmor precession in
the case of a magnetic field

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.040
is given by minus lambda times
the magnetic field, gamma times

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.000
the magnetic field, where gamma
is that constant that relates

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.660
the magnetic moment
of the particle

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.250
to the spin angular
momentum of the particle.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.330
Then we got, moreover,
that the energy

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.840
levels of this Hamiltonian--
this is a two-state systems,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930
so it's a two-dimensional
vector space

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.780
that can be at most
two energy eigenstates.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.090
That's the simple thing
about two-state systems.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.760
These two energy
eigenstates have

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.100
the energies equal
to g0 plus/minus g.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.280
And the plus corresponds
to the spin state n plus,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.760
and the minus corresponds
to the spin state n minus.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.600
And you don't have to
talk spin states when

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.030
you write this spin
states over here.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.840
The plus, you should think of
spinning in the plus direction,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840
but the thing that we call
plus is the first basis vector.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.680
And the thing that we call
minus is the second basis vector

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.340
of this state space.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.240
Therefore, if you've
given a matrix,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.460
Hamiltonian has nothing
to do with spins.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.100
You still have the notion
that the first basis

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.560
vector, whatever it is-- an
iron moving in this direction--

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.920
is the mathematical
analog of a spin up.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.720
And the second basis vector--
whatever else it may be--

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.210
is the analog of the spin down.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.430
So this will be important
for what we do now,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.270
as we begin the study
of the ammonia molecule,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.170
and its states.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.900
So having reviewed the key
ideas from the last part

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.905
of last lecture, are
there any questions?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:08.486
So let me begin with this
ammonia molecule-- double M,

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:12.370
M-O-N-I-A, is NH3.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.340
It's used as a fertilizer.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.820
It's a gas, has strong
odor, no color, fertilizers,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.090
cleaning products,
pharmaceuticals,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.100
all kinds of things.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.390
It has the shape of a flattened
tetrahedron with a nitrogen

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.050
atom at one corner, say, and the
base the three hydrogen atoms.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.350
If it would not be a flattened
tetrahedron, this angle

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.610
over here-- if it would
be an equilateral, regular

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.830
tetrahedron, this
angle over there

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.110
would be 60 degrees,
because this every phase

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.900
would be an
equilateral triangle.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.520
But if it's a
flattened tetrahedron,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.860
if it will be totally flat--
then n would be at the base.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.380
The angle in between
these two edges

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.910
would be 120 degrees, because
they have to add up to 360.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.960
Well, this has 108 degrees,
so it's pretty flat,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.460
this tetrahedron.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.060
And you can imagine, actually,
this is a two-state system,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.000
because just as the
nitrogen can be like this--

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.530
can be up with respect to
the base of the hydrogens,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.690
it could also be down.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.940
And so you can imagine
this molecule rotating,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.100
and suddenly the up
nitrogen goes down,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.660
and this keeps rotating--
a possible transition

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.170
of the system, in
which, well, I don't

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.920
know if I'm drawing it well.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.480
I don't think so.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:13.120
But roughly, it could be like
this-- the nitrogen is down.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.390
And this, in principle,
would be like two

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.060
possible configurations
of this system.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.570
There's a barrier.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.900
This is in equilibrium,
so if you try to push it,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.810
it's not easy.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.010
But if you did
manage to push it,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.140
it would be stable in
the other direction.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:40.965
It is as if you had a potential
for the nitrogen-- a V of z--

00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:48.220
the direction is z-- in which
it can be here, up or down.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.330
And it's stable in
either one, but there's

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.920
a big barrier in between.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.160
So that's the story
of this nitrogen atom.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.240
And we're going
to try to describe

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.140
this as a two-state system.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.200
So I need some notation.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.410
Well, I'm going to
have the first basis

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:18.830
state to be called up for N
up, and the second basis state

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.800
is going to be called
down for nitrogen down.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.390
And now, I'm going
to try to write

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.960
the Hamiltonian for this system.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:47.470
Well, you know what
sort of happens here.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.000
Your intuition in quantum
mechanics with wave functions

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.380
should be similar.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.220
Look-- this is not
the two-state system,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.110
because there may be
many energy eigenstates,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.930
but you know that the ground
state looks like a wave

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.365
function, just like this.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.050
And the first
excited state could

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:25.340
look like a wave function
that is like-- oops-- this.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.720
Pretty much the same
thing, but you flip one,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.200
and if the barrier
is sufficiently high,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.860
these two energy levels
are not that different.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.460
So the question is,
how do we model this?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:45.065
There may be an energy
E0 for the system,

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:48.500
a ground state energy maybe,
and a little bit of a higher

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.760
energy.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.885
So we're going to
write the Hamiltonian.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.740
And I'm going to put
E0 for the moment.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.270
And my first basis
state is 1 and up.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.570
This would be the
1 0, and here would

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.060
be the 0 1, the
second basis state.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.640
And this is saying
that 1 0, the N up,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.760
is an energy eigenstate
of energy E0.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.290
And down is an energy eigenstate
of energy in up as well.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.140
But that can't be the story.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.660
There cannot be two
degenerate energy eigenstates.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.810
Your intuition tells you
that this is impossible.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.050
One dimensional potential
wouldn't say that.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.750
So there must be
something else happening.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.720
This cannot be the whole
Hamiltonian that describes

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.830
the physics of the problem.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.420
So what we're going
to do is try to tinker

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.330
with this Hamiltonian,
a simple tinkering that

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.080
is going to give us the
physics that we expect.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.680
So I'm going to put a
constant delta here.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.160
This should be Hermitian, so I
should put the delta as well,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.170
another constant there.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.720
For convenience,
however, I'd rather

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.300
put the minus sign there.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.410
I will define delta to be
positive for definiteness,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:33.950
and for convenience, however,
I will put here minus delta.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:39.840
Now, you could say look,
you say that, but maybe

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.050
it's not for convenience.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.500
Maybe it changes the physics.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.130
Well, it cannot
change the physics,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.810
because these things
are the matrix elements

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:56.200
of the Hamiltonian-- the 1 2,
and the 2 1 matrix elements.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.370
And I could decide to change
what they call the first basis

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.810
vector, to call it minus
the first basis vector.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.810
This would change the sign of
this, change the sign of that,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.000
without changing those signs.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.460
So this sign is a
matter of a basis.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.490
So we certainly have
not made any assumption

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.960
by putting that to be a
minus sign over there.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.080
Now, once you have
this Hamiltonian,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.510
this delta is going
to be some energy.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.260
And that's going to be what
mimics the physics here,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.720
because these states are not
going to be any more energy

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.050
eigenstates.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.700
The matrix is not
diagonal anymore.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.650
So the 1 0 vector,
and the 0 1 vector

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.630
are not any more
energy eigenstates.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.420
Moreover, it's
interesting to try

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.600
to figure out what it has to
do with our previous system.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:03.090
So this is E0 times 1
minus delta times sigma 1.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.520
And that's a good thing to know.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:18.350
So in this case,
comparing to this g

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:23.180
is the vector in
the x direction,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.590
because its g
multiplying by sigma 1.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.410
And it has magnitude delta.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.560
So we notice-- and we're going
to make a picture later--

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:43.360
is that g, in this case so
far, is equal to delta times

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.000
the unit vector in
the x direction,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.885
minus delta times the unit
vector in the x direction.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.390
So g is equal to delta.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.900
So, OK, we've written those.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.440
Let's then figure out
what are the ground

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.650
states and the excited states.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.510
And this is a two by two matrix,
and a simple one, at that.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.070
So you could just
do it, or better

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.020
to figure out what we're doing.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.090
We'll use our formulas before.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.940
Yes, George.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.860
AUDIENCE: So why is
it that we mandate

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.300
that delta has to be real?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.700
I mean, that's not
the most general form.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.190
PROFESSOR: That's right, it's
not the most general form.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.380
So at this moment,
we're trying to do

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.860
what any reasonable
physicist does.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.850
Without delta, it doesn't
match the physics.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.330
So let's try the simplest
thing that can work,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.380
and a delta real--
we'll see if it works.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.890
And if it works, we'll worry
later about different things.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.290
So we'll put the simplest
thing at this moment,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.400
but indeed, we could put
more complicated things.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:13.660
So given this, in fact, we know
what it the energy eigenstates

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.180
should be, or we
more or less can

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.910
guess what the energy
eigenstates should be.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:26.930
Let me tell you the energies
are g0 plus/minus g,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:36.340
so you're going to get E0
plus delta and e0 minus

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:46.180
delta as the energies--
E excited, and E ground.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.490
And the gap between
these two energies--

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:55.220
the gap between these two
energy levels is 2 delta.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.840
So there we go.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.540
We've already produced
something good.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.130
We have two energy eigenstates.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.420
There should be a small
energy difference,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.820
and that gap is 2 delta.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.950
Now, what are those states?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.750
Well, it's not too hard to
see that the eigenstate that

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.980
has this energy is
the excited state, is

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:30.500
1 over square root
of 2, 1 minus 1.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.640
If you add with
this matrix on this,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.690
that's the energy eigenstate.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.860
And the energy
eigenstate for this one

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.460
is 1 over square root of 2, 1 1.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.170
Let's write them.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.900
These are the eigenvectors.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.440
Let's write them as 1
over square root of 2,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:02.310
nitrogen up minus nitrogen down,
and 1 over square root of 2

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.430
nitrogen up plus nitrogen down.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:19.839
So I want to, even though it's
not complicated to do this,

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.859
and we have called these states
that way, so it's all clear.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:32.260
I want you to see how that comes
from our spin way of thinking.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.000
So you know there's
this molecule,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.060
and for this molecule,
only one direction matters.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.580
We could have called
it x, if we wanted.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.930
In fact, maybe x would
have been a better name.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.080
On the other hand,
for spin states,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.680
there are three
dimensions-- x, y, and z.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.870
So we have to think
in an abstract way.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.780
So where is this vector G?

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.870
We said G is minus delta Ex.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.970
So this is the x-axis.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.340
This is the y-axis.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.440
This is the z-axis.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.210
G is here.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.830
The vector G goes
back over here,

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.000
is minus delta x hat vector.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:29.650
Now, what if you
have g in that way?

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:37.210
You know that the
excited state is

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.000
one of these states over here.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.530
Let's see-- this N plus
is the excited state,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.640
and N minus is the lower state.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.950
So the excited
state should point

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:01.120
in the direction of g
vector, because N corresponds

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.170
to the direction
of the g vector.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:13.110
G is positive here, this
little g is positive.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.590
So g is in there.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:25.720
N is in there as well,
because g and n are parallel.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.800
And the excited state
should correspond

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.970
to N, a vector in
the plus n direction.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.585
So the excited state
should be here.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.870
It's a spin state
in that direction.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.400
That's what that formula says.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.050
And the ground state should
be a spin state in the minus N

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.500
direction, so this must
be the ground state.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.150
So this I call
the excited state,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.410
and this the ground state.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:15.850
And indeed, remember now that
what is your translation.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.260
1 and 2-- the 1 and 2 states
are like the plus and minus

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.450
of spins.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:29.460
So in terms of spin
language, this excited state

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.180
is the plus minus the minus.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:48.190
And this is the plus plus the
minus, because the up is plus,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.810
the down is minus.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.380
So indeed, this state--
you probably remember it.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.290
This is a spin along
the x direction.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.710
So the ground state must be like
a spin along the x direction.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.870
That's here.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.370
The excited state is a spin, the
orthogonal one in the minus x

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.530
direction, so it must be a
state orthogonal to this one,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.310
as to this, and it points
in the other direction.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:23.950
So those are our spins.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.800
And we had that the gap
delta-- the gap is 2 omega.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.100
It's an energy, so
it's what we called

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:40.950
h omega naught a photon--
the transition energy.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.380
I could give this energy in eVs,
but I actually don't have it.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.880
I have the wavelength of the
frequency of the associated

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.500
photon.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.720
So this corresponds
to a frequency

00:21:53.720 --> 00:22:03.430
nu of 23.87 gigahertz,
and a lambda of about

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:09.155
1.26 centimeters-- more
or less half an inch.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:20.980
So that is the
transition difference

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.730
between these two levels.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.510
So this is something
people knew--

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:29.280
there's two levels
above this molecule,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.280
and they correspond
to the result

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.920
of this perturbation
that splits them.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.970
So in a sense, we've got a nice
model-- perfectly reasonable

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.830
model, without introducing
much complexity-- of what

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.750
this thing is doing.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.850
So let's do a little exercise.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:56.410
Let's see how does the N
up state evolve in time?

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:19.000
So we have psi at time
equals 0 be in the state up.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.350
What is it later?

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.210
There are many ways to do
it-- many, many ways to do it.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:33.340
The quickest, in principle,
is to think about spins,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.420
even if just a little painful.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.340
But let's think about spins.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:52.210
Omega l is going to be
around the direction of g.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.645
So think of the
state of the spin.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.465
The N up state, the
up state, is here.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:18.340
And then it's going to
precess with angular frequency

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.650
vector in the direction of g.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.980
So it's going to precess
in the direction of g.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.090
So you can imagine now
this vector precessing.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.310
And it's going to go-- since
it's essentially the minus x

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.520
direction-- precession in
time is going to flip it

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.040
to the y-axis, and then make
it rotate in the z-y axis.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.430
That's all what
it's going to do.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:45.330
So you have a picture of
what it's going to do.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.950
We might as well calculate a
little, although the picture is

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.660
complete, and the frequency
is known, and everything.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.300
But what you do
here, of course, is

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.210
you try to write it in
terms of energy eigenstates.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:07.970
And the up state is
the 1 over square root

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.035
times the sum of e plus g.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.710
And you know the energies
of those two states,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.580
so you know how
they evolve in time.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.970
It will be in the notes.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.220
You can do this.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:36.130
After you now evolve, with e
to the minus i ht over h bar,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:44.630
you then go back from
e to g, to up and down,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.690
because that's sort of the
intuition that we want to

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.850
Have.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.570
So it's not difficult.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.000
None of these steps
are difficult.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.190
e and g are written in
terms of up and down.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.060
So what does one get?

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:12.130
One gets psi of t is equal e
to the minus i, et over h bar

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:18.830
times cosine of t
delta over h bar,

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:28.670
times the state up plus i
sine of t delta over h bar,

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.625
state down.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.970
This is the time evolution, so
the probabilities, for example,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:53.360
to be up is the square of
this one-- cosine squared

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.570
of t delta over h bar.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.380
And the probability
to be down is sine

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.340
squared of the same thing.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.190
So this poor nitrogen
molecule, if it

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.860
happens to have
the nitrogen up, is

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.120
going to start
rotating like crazy,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.420
even if you don't do anything.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.740
It's just sitting there, and
it's rotating up and down,

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:34.780
with a speed doing this thing
23 billion times a second.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.250
Molecule's up and
down, because it's not

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.860
in a stationary eigenstate.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.940
Now, here, actually,
you may think

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:52.000
that something is a little
funny, because you would say,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.850
well, the frequency of rotation
is like delta over h bar,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:03.440
but the Larmor frequency is
supposed to be 2g over h bar,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.960
so it would correspond to a
Larmor frequency of 2 delta

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.196
over h bar, which is exactly
the frequency of the photons.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.140
But there's no
contradiction here.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.940
This is, in fact,
rotating at that speed,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.080
at twice that speed.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.560
Because if you remember,
for a spin state,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.550
this was the cosine
of theta over 2.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.270
Therefore, as it changes,
that's the way theta over 2

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.480
is changing.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.080
But theta, which is the angle
of this physical rotation,

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.770
changes twice as fast.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.405
So it's, again, those
1/2s of spin states that

00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:52.910
are very confusing sometimes.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.040
But there's no contradiction.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.870
The sort of Larmor frequency
of the equivalent spin problem

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.800
is exactly the same
as the frequency

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.160
of the original problem.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:16.240
So now we want to make this
into something more practical.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.920
And for that, what we
explore is the fact

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.255
that this molecule has an
electric dipole moment.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:39.050
So the molecule as
we pictured it there,

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.210
as it happens, the
electrons of the hydrogen

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.600
sort of cluster
near the nitrogen.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.620
So this up region
is kind of negative.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.190
The bottom region
is kind of positive,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:55.285
and there is an electric
dipole moment pointing down.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.960
So this is a pretty
important property

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.720
of this molecule,
this dipole moment.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.380
And electric dipoles
we usually call p.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.800
But for some reason-- maybe
I should change the notes,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.440
at some stage or maybe this
is discussed very nicely

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.680
in Feynman's
lectures on physics.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.000
He uses mu for this,
like for magnetic dipole.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.890
So I will actually
use mu as well, now.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:33.300
So this thing has
an electric dipole,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:40.970
and therefore the energy
is the electric dipole

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.830
dotted with the electric field.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.210
And that electric field is
an external electric field.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.810
You have this little dipole,
which is this molecule,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.940
and you put it inside
an electric field,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.010
and there's a contribution
to the energy,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:03.220
just because the dipole is
sitting on an electric field.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.560
And that means our
Hamiltonian is now changed.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.460
So I will consider
the case in which we

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.150
have an electric field
in the z direction--

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.760
a positive electric field
in the z direction--

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:33.620
so that E is equal to E times z.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:40.680
And mu would be equal
to minus mu times z,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.240
because it points down.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.580
We've assumed that
the dipole is down.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.870
And the dipole is down
for the case of spin

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.740
in the z direction.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:04.420
So look what we get here--
this energy contribution is

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.400
essentially mu E. And
it's the energy that

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.370
is acquired by the state in
which the nitrogen is up.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.030
This is for nitrogen up.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.930
So what we've
discovered-- if we want

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.890
to model this in the
Hamiltonian is that we can take

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:33.150
the Hamiltonian that we
have-- E0 minus delta,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:43.400
e0 minus delta, and the energy
of the state up with nitrogen

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.950
up, is this one--
mu E. So we add

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:52.030
mu E. And the one
with the spin down

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.470
will be the opposite, so
it will be minus mu E.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:33:02.710
And this is our reasonable
expectation for the Hamiltonian

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:09.920
of this molecule inside
an electric field.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.410
So this is the NH3 in E field.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.630
So again, we can wonder what
kind of thing happens here.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.370
And the best thing is to
first say this is E0 1

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.730
minus delta sigma 1.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:38.250
And then you see, oh,
it's mu E sigma 3.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.570
So getting to
that, and I realize

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.265
this is a little more
painful than the other one.

00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:45.840
And we don't have to
do it, because we've

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.430
solved the general problem.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.630
And the energies,
this time, are going

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:58.340
to be E of the excited one,
and E of the lower one-- ground

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.200
state.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.850
It's going to be E0 plus g.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:10.310
And g was the magnitude
of the vector g.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.250
So it's the magnitude
of the vector g

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:24.810
that now has components
minus delta 0 and mu E.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:29.570
So here we get plus
square root of delta

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.080
squared plus mu E squared.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:42.590
And here is 0 minus square
root of delta squared plus mu

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.455
E squared.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.802
So there we go.

00:34:51.802 --> 00:34:55.090
If we know how the
energies behave,

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.030
even if we have some
electric field--

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:02.550
and typically delta
is such, and mu

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.230
is such that, for
most electric fields

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.220
that you ever have
in the lab-- this

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.330
is very small compared to that.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.740
The dipole moment is
sufficiently small

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.710
that the energies
that you get from here

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.230
are pale compared to the
difference of energies

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.580
over there.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.890
So you can approximate.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:34.235
This is E0 plus delta plus
1/2 mu E squared over delta.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.240
This is for mu E small.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:49.410
Here E0 minus delta minus
1/2 mu E over delta squared.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:54.870
And this is when mu E is
much smaller than delta.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.280
Now, the only reason
I point this out

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.380
is because it does provide
a technological opportunity

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:10.720
to separate a beam of
particles into excited-

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.580
and the ground-state level.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.660
Sort of like
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:23.820
you put, now, this beam that
has this ammonia molecules.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.290
And you put them inside
an electric field

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.520
that has a gradient.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.170
In a gradient,
this state is going

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.520
to try to go to
minimize its energy.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.680
So it's going to go to the
regions of the electric field

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.530
where the electric
field is small.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.290
This particle
minimizes its energy

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.370
when it goes to the regions
of the electric field

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.000
when the electric field is big.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.570
So it's like putting it in
a Stern-Gerlach experiment.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.890
You have your beam,
and you separate them.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.470
You have your beam
and you manage

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:05.170
to separate the things that
can be in an excited state,

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.400
and the things that are
in the ground state.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.420
And now what you do is
insert these excited states

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.315
into a resonant cavity.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.480
Have a little hole here,
and a little hole here,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:35.605
and E comes in, and
something comes out.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:45.930
So we're getting now to
the design of the maser.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.050
The idea that we're
trying to do is

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:59.670
that we try to
make a cavity tuned

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:06.400
to 23.7 gigahertz-- the
frequency associated

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.295
with a gap.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:19.610
And we just insert those Es
over there, these excited states

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:26.030
over there, and hope that
by the time they go out,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.010
they become a g.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.940
Because if they go from E--
say there was an electric field

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.370
here to separate them,
and then E's over here.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.630
This is the excited state.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.830
There's no more electric
fields over here.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.590
It just comes into the
cavity as an excited state.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:51.140
The excited state has
energy E0 plus delta.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:57.590
And then, if it manages to go
out of the cavity as the ground

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:02.250
state, then it would have
energy E0 minus delta.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.390
It must've lost energy to delta.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.360
That can go nicely into
the electromagnetic field

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.400
and become one photon--
a one photon state

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.510
in the cavity of
the right frequency,

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.130
because the cavity
is tuned to that.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.980
The only difficulty
with this assumption

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.420
is that E is an
energy eigenstate.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.030
So energy eigenstates are lazy.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.930
They're stationary states.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.980
They don't like to change.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.630
So there's no reason why
it should go out as g.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.650
It's excited state.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.810
It's perfectly happy to
remain excited forever.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:51.210
So what must happen
somehow is that there's

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:56.010
an electric field
here in the cavity,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.850
and that stimulates this
thing to make the transition,

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.370
because once there's
an electric field,

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.800
E is not anymore an
energy eigenstate.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.400
The E of the original
system is not anymore

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.070
an energy eigenstate,
and nor is this.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.030
So then it's going
to change in time.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.670
So the problem is a
delicate one in which

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.960
we want to somehow have
an electric field here

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.580
that is self-consistent
with the idea

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:32.800
that this excited state goes
out as the ground state.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.530
And that's why it's
microwave amplification

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.310
by stimulated
emission of radiation,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.660
because you're going to
amplify a signal here.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.840
It's a microwave, 1
centimeter wavelength--

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.610
that's a microwave.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.090
And the stimulation is the
fact that this wouldn't do it

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:56.200
unless there's some
electric field already.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.880
So you could say, well, so
how does it get started?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.010
There's no electric
field to begin with.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.880
Well, you know
quantum mechanics,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.540
and you know that in general,
there are little fluctuations,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.960
and there's energies--
small photons, one

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.920
or two photons that suddenly
appear because of anything.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.770
Any motion of charges
in here produces

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.570
an electromagnetic wave.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.390
So at the beginning, yes--
there's no many photons here.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.290
But somehow, by having it
resonate at that frequency,

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.310
it's very easy to
get those photons.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.540
And a few appear, and a few
molecules start to turn in,

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.020
and then very soon this is full
with energy, in which there's

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.860
a consistent configuration of
some electric field oscillating

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:50.360
and producing precisely
the right transitions here.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.030
So I want to use the next 50
minutes to describe that math.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.550
How do we do this?

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.800
Because it just
shows really the sort

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.620
of hard part of the problem.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.780
How do you get
consistently a field,

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.310
and the radiation going on?

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:17.230
So maybe I should call
this E prime and g prime.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.670
They shouldn't be confused.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:23.750
E and g are these states
that we had before.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.840
And E prime and g prime, we
never wrote those states,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.280
but they are deformed states
due to an electric field.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.140
OK, so what do we have to do?

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.190
Well here is E and g.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:42.650
And we had a Hamiltonian.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.330
There's going to be an
electric field here,

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.500
so this Hamiltonian
is the relevant one.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.180
The only problem
with this Hamiltonian

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.130
is that this is going to be a
time-dependent field, something

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.920
that we're a little scared
of-- Hamiltonians with time

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.640
dependence-- for good
reason, because they're hard.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.800
But anyway, let's try to see.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.960
Today's all about Hamiltonians
with time dependence.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.220
So there's going to
be a time-dependent

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.550
is going to be the wave here.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.330
So that's the
relevant Hamiltonian.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:20.580
But it's the Hamiltonian in the
1 2 basis, in that up nitrogen,

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.030
down nitrogen basis.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:27.270
I want that Hamiltonian
in the Eg basis.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.230
It's better.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.620
It's more useful.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:38.907
So let's try to see how that
looks-- Hamiltonian in the Eg

00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:39.406
basis.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:57.860
H prime in E equal 1 g equal
2 primes, maybe put basis.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:07.290
So here is the
Hamiltonian in this basis.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.480
In the 1 2 basis, I have to
pass to the other basis, the Eg

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.050
basis.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.890
So it's not complicated.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:21.830
It takes a little work, but
it's nothing all that difficult.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:30.000
For example, in the 1 prime h
1 prime, which would be the 1 1

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.380
element of this
matrix, I'm supposed

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.603
to put here 1 prime is EhE.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:45.000
And now I'm supposed to
say, OK, what is this?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.360
Well, E is 1 over
square root of 2.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.390
E was 1 over square
root of 2, 1 minus 1.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:09.450
H is the original H, so it's
E0 plus mu E minus delta minus

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:21.220
delta E0 minus mu E. And E
is 1 1, 1 minus 1, again.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.420
And there's also the
square root of 2.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.150
So at the end, this is a 1/2.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.880
So this is the kind
of thing you have

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.820
to do to pass to this basis.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.590
So I think I'll do
that in the notes.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.270
And this calculation is simple.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.715
In this case, it
gives E0 plus delta.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.383
And in retrospect, that sort
of is pretty reasonable.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:56.700
This is E0 plus delta, and
this is E0 minus delta.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.270
And if you didn't have
an electric field--

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:02.960
indeed in this basis,
the first state

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.750
is the excited state
who has this energy.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.490
The second state is the ground
state, and has this energy.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.920
And that makes sense
if there's no mu E.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:18.420
Well, the mu E still shows
up, and it shows up here.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.380
So that is the
Hamiltonian in this basis,

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.120
and the general
state in this basis

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.080
is the amplitude to be
excited, and the amplitude

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.930
to be in the ground state.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:42.240
This is the general psi of t.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:50.550
So your Schrodinger equation in
this mu basis-- not mu basis,

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:59.080
in the Eg basis, you see it's--
Eg basis is the basis of energy

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.750
eigenstates if you don't
have electric field.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.910
But once you have
an electric field,

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.220
it's not anymore energy
eigenstates, and much worse

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.540
if you have a time-dependent
electric field.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:22.570
So the Schrodinger equation
is i h bar d dt of CE Cg

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.440
is equal to this mu matrix.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.810
And now, E0 is totally
irrelevant for everything.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.400
It's a constant of
the unit matrix.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.150
Let's put E0 to 0.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.580
There's no need to keep it.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.870
E0 equal zero.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:51.803
So we have delta mu E
minus delta times CECg.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:02.270
I d dt of psi, h psi--
the Schrodinger equation.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:05.150
Now, the real
difficulty that we have

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:09.000
is that E is a function of time.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.210
So this is not all that trivial.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:21.900
So what you do to solve this is
simplify the equation by saying

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.960
what would the
solution be if you

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.440
didn't have a function of time?

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:35.920
Then you would have-- if you
didn't have E, CE Cg of time

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:43.250
would be E to the minus i ht.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:48.170
So this would be i delta
t-- the energy of this,

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.330
if there's no electric
field, the Hamiltonian

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.960
will be delta minus delta.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.650
So here, I have my
psi ht over h bar.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:00.640
And for the lower
state, you would have E

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:06.460
to the plus i delta t
over h bar as solutions,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.930
if you didn't have this.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.680
This would be the solutions.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.070
But we want now better.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.060
So what we're going
to say is well,

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.810
that's a solution
if I neglect this.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.040
So this cannot be
the real solution.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:31.860
So I'll put here beta sub E
of t, and a beta sub g of t.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:38.550
And sure-- if no electric
field, betas are 1.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.200
They're not necessary.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.230
But if there is
an electric field,

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.080
the betas are going
to be complicated,

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.320
so we need them there.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.180
So this is like an [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:59.230
Now you could plug this back,
and calculate what you get.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:01.380
And it should not
be too surprising

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:07.260
that you're going to get in here
something in which these deltas

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:11.330
are going to disappear, because
this thing takes care of that.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.850
So there's a little
bit of algebra

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.760
here, maybe two, three
lines of algebra.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.440
And let me give
you what you get--

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:27.030
I h bar d dt of beta E beta g.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:31.100
Now the equation is really
for this quantities--

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:37.100
and it's 0 E to the
i omega 0t times mu

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:42.220
E, E to the minus
i omega 0t times

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:52.710
mu E0, beta E, beta g,
where omega 0 is the Larmor

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:57.485
frequency, or 2
delta over h bar.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.290
So some calculation
involved, but I

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.370
hope you don't lose track
of the physics here.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.290
The physics is
that the amplitude

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:15.030
to be in E and the
amplitudes to be in g

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:23.000
have now been replaced by beta
and beta g, which are expected

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.600
to be simpler
things to calculate.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.476
And in fact, since the
probability to be in E

00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:31.820
is the norm of to
this thing squared,

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.940
beta is as good as C to know
how likely is the particle

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.910
to be in E, or how
likely is the particle

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.750
to be in the ground state.

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.370
You could use beta, because
they differ by a phase.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:49.110
So betas have still the
physical significance

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:53.310
of the amplitude
to be in E or g.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.780
And we're still having
an electric field

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.950
that is time dependent here.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:03.540
So it's time to put
the time dependence,

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:08.810
and what are we going to do?

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.833
Well we're going to find a sort
of self-consistent operation

00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:21.070
of this device, in which we will
have an electromagnetic field,

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:29.150
E. E of t will be
2 E-- letter E,

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:33.460
that now is going to be a
constant with an E0, cosine

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:38.240
omega 0 t-- again the Larmor
frequency or the photon

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.710
frequency that is emitted
by the possible transition.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:46.510
So we will consider the case
when the cavity has already

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.620
that electric field
that is going precisely

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:55.530
at the right speed
to do things well.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.200
So this Et, with the 2
conveniently put here,

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:06.990
is equal to E0 E to the i omega
naught t plus e to the minus i

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:08.460
omega naught t.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:18.170
So when you multiply these
things, what do you get?

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.650
Let me do one of
them for you to see.

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:27.690
You get this i--
the top one-- h I'm

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.230
going to put to the other side.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:34.980
Beta E is going
to be beta E dot,

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:40.710
is going to couple
with this to beta g.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:45.790
So that thing is going to be
this electric field times mu,

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:51.530
so mu e0, the h bar
from the left-hand side,

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:55.630
and you have E to the i omega
naught t multiplying this,

00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:04.520
so it's 1 plus E to the 2i
omega naught t times beta g.

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.833
So that's the first equation.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:13.090
Not all that easy, for sure.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:20.520
Second equation--
i beta g dot is

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:27.020
equal to mu E0
over h bar, 1 plus

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:35.620
e to the minus 2i omega
naught t beta E of t.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:46.400
And now you have to think
maybe a little like engineers,

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.860
or physicists, or
mathematicians--

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.050
whatever you prefer.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.520
But you want to
convince yourself

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.410
that what you want
to do is true.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.050
And what do you want to do?

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:04.290
I like to forget about
these curves, basically.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.720
That's what we want to do.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.510
Why would that be true?

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.900
Well, here's a
reason why it's true.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.610
This is a number that sort of
goes between 1 and minus 1,

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.470
with some phase.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:27.590
Mu E0, however, over h bar,
is a very small number.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:32.010
Mu E0 we're thinking of--
we're saying compared

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:40.250
to the natural scales of the
problem, this energy, mu E0,

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.370
is much smaller than delta.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:50.770
And delta is the thing that is
related to omega naught, which

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:56.460
h bar omega naught
is equal to 2 delta.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:05.120
So essentially,
mu E0 is an energy

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.290
which is very, very slow
compared to h omega naught.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:15.110
Now, being very small,
whatever this is,

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.390
this time derivative is
going to be very small.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:22.410
So beta E and beta
g are going to be

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:27.500
very small-time derivatives--
going to move slowly.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:33.460
If they move slowly over the
time that this oscillates,

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.595
this hasn't changed a lot.

00:56:35.595 --> 00:56:39.440
And therefore, the average of
this function over that time

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.705
is 0, and it doesn't contribute
to the differential equation.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.340
It's actually a good argument.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.300
You can try to
convince yourselves,

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.870
or maybe I'll try better
in some way, or something.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.350
But it is right.

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:05.190
I've tried it, actually,
out with computers

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.940
and with Mathematica,
and things like that.

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.580
And it's really
absolutely true--

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.450
that if you think of
differential equations

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.370
as integrals, that you
integrate with this

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.920
in the right-hand side, you
can see that if this-- really,

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.570
the time derivative
is controlled

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.950
by this, that corresponds
to a frequency much smaller

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.280
than omega naught.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.330
These ones don't matter.

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:36.420
So it's really interesting,
and still not trivial.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:45.090
But this is a case where we end
up ignoring part of the thing.

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:54.430
So what do we get, then? i beta
E dot is equal mu E0 over h bar

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:57.400
beta g.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:08.470
And the second equation-- i beta
g dot equal mu E0 over h bar

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:13.880
beta E. Therefore, if
you multiply by another i

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:20.840
here, and differentiate
i-- i beta double dot of E

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.670
is equal mu E0 over h bar.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:29.170
The i extra that we
borrowed, the dot here.

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.090
You can use the second equation.

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:42.410
So you get mu E0 over h-bar
squared beta E. Therefore,

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:53.150
beta E double dot is equal to
minus mu E0 over h-bar beta E.

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.580
And you, see your
you're rotating

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:09.170
with the a of-- put the
h-bar-- with a frequency

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.220
that i much smaller
than omega 0.

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.740
So this as a frequency,
this is like omega 0.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:23.280
So indeed, the rate of
change of this thing

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.660
goes with the frequency
that's much smaller.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.760
And it's all right, actually.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:33.230
So, we've had that, and then
we can write the solution,

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.460
finally.

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.510
So, what is it?

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:47.180
Beta E of T is cosine
mu E0 t over h-bar.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:57.350
And the probability
to be in the E state

00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:02.460
is the square of that
amplitude, so the probability

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.870
to be in the E state at time
t is the square of that.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:15.690
So it's cos squared
mu E 0 t over h-bar.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:18.640
Again, I'm sorry,
this beta is here,

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.450
and the probability to
be in the excited state

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.620
is this square of ce,
but the square of ce

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:32.190
is the square of beta E,
so I just square this.

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.080
So there you go.

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:46.070
We have this thing, and we
now have an understanding

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.950
of how this goes
as time goes by.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:58.030
In fact, this mu e 0 T or
h-bar under bar goes by.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.900
This starts to as
a cosine squared,

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.680
and then it goes like this.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.370
And this is the place when
this is equal to pi over 2.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.490
So, what do we need?

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:19.350
We need the place
where this happens--

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:28.490
we can call that time T-- be
such that mu E 0 T over h-bar

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:35.360
be equal to pi over
2, or 3 pi over 2.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:41.210
For those values of time,
the probability to be excited

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:45.380
is zero, and therefore you
must be in the ground state.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:51.830
These two probabilities
squared added go to 1.

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:57.460
So you're either E or G. So if
you have zero probability to be

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:06.580
in E, you will be
in the state G.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:11.250
So, the whole issue is
basically at this moment

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:15.900
that you must give
the right speed,

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.830
or for a given the
speed of the molecules,

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:23.340
there will be a time that
it takes to traverse.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.140
That time is related
to the steady state

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:33.990
value of this electric
field by this relation.

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:37.960
So you need the right
velocity-- the molecules have

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.950
to be at the right
temperature, that's

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:44.450
when they'll have a velocity--
so that they travel in such

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.980
a way that is
consistent with this.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:54.370
As they do that, each of these
particles that goes from E to G

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:57.400
gives out one
photon, one quantum

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.090
of the electromagnetic
field, and helps

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:03.580
build the time
dependent electric field

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.990
that we started
at the beginning.

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:12.730
Now if you, at some point for
some speed of the molecules,

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.790
you saturate this and you
build some electric field,

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:21.600
and then you have your cavity
operating at the nominal way.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.410
And then, of course, you want
to use this for something,

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:29.260
so you shine, let it go out,
and shine those microwaves

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.660
or do something.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.560
And if you want to
recharge it, you

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.870
keep adding nitrogen molecules.

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:40.280
Now, this was a great
discovery, actually.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.590
Charles Townes,
Gordon, and Zeiger,

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.750
built this ammonia
maser in 1953.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.110
They got the Nobel Prize.

01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:55.450
Nobel Prize, Charles
Townes got it in 1964.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:57.500
And he emphasized
that this masers

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.830
do the most perfect
amplification

01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:04.280
consistent with the
uncertainty principle.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.040
This is a coherent state of
flight that is built here,

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.560
and it's much better than any
vacuum amplifier or anything

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.730
like that, because the
thing that this giving out

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.980
those photons is a molecule
that this uncharged.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.680
So it doesn't disturb
the electromagnetic field

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.290
in the cavity as
it goes through.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:28.170
Many times you use an
electron, for example,

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.000
to give out some energy.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.800
But the electron
itself is charged,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.640
so it produces additional
electromagnetic fields,

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.630
shot noise, all kinds of noise.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:40.610
This is absolutely
quiet device in which

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:46.990
is this turns from one state
to another smoothly, stimulated

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.080
by the electric field, because
if there was no electric field

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.460
would be an energy eigenstate
and then it gives out photon

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.170
after photon.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:04.660
So the uncertainties actually,
in this noble lecture,

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.830
which is fun to
read-- in fact, you

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:12.730
remember delta N
delta phi supposed

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:15.400
to be greater than 1/2.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.150
Well, for coherent states as
we more or less discussed,

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:22.480
this thing is saturated.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.980
And what do you have now?

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.900
You have a coherent
state of light.

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.430
You may remember
that the expectation

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:34.850
value of N in a coherent
state alpha was alpha squared.

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:40.430
And you call this the
number n of photons.

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:47.100
And the uncertainty in
N was, in fact, alpha.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.070
So, it's square root of n.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:06:01.830
So for this thing,
we have the situation

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:07.720
in which we are working
with a coherent state that

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.750
saturates this.

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:17.900
So delta n times delta
phi is about one half.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.810
And delta n is square root
of the number of photons.

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:26.310
So delta phi is about
to 1 over 2 square root

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:27.686
of the number of photons.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.160
And you can imagine
the cavity easily

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.680
can have 10 to the 12
photons, and to 15 photons.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.020
Something fairly big.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.580
And you get an
uncertainty phase.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.340
The thing is coherent.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.800
All the pieces of that
electromagnetic wave,

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.700
the phases are very coherent
up to an incredibly great

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.550
accuracy.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:03.410
So it's a great discovery and
the beginning of many things

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:07.480
that were done here, in fact,
by Professor Kleppner and others

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.480
in the '60s with
other type of lasers

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.130
and masers and this whole thing.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.910
So, that's pretty
much what's I wanted

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:19.580
to say about the ammonia
and these things,

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.550
and we're going
to use the last 15

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.570
minutes to begin
something else, NMR.

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:30.040
And, so are there any
questions so this Point?

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.946
Yes?

01:07:31.946 --> 01:07:32.862
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.910
If it started changing
between states,

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:41.389
I sort of imagine a photon
being omitted and absorbed,

01:07:41.389 --> 01:07:44.868
what exactly is happening
then? [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:44.868 --> 01:07:47.850
I just happened to catch
it in the right moment.

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:50.310
PROFESSOR: Well, in this
case, it's basically

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:55.310
omitted all the time, because
we've tuned the cavity in such

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:59.930
a way that if it comes
as E, goes out as G.

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:03.540
So the whole process by
the time that it entered

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.050
and it went out, it has to
have omitted one photon.

01:08:10.092 --> 01:08:11.675
AUDIENCE: In the
midst of the process,

01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:13.830
how does it get back
somehow, because it's

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.920
sort of oscillating
between states.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.800
PROFESSOR: It
doesn't get it back.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.660
If the cavity would be
badly designed in such a way

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:26.710
that it may be twice as long,
it would out still come as E.

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:29.090
So it would make
the one transition

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.319
and then absorb
another thing, it

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.684
would just not
generate anything.

01:08:33.684 --> 01:08:34.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.266
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:08:35.266 --> 01:08:36.279
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:40.990
PROFESSOR: And you know,
a more complete discussion

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:46.410
of this, of course, if you
really want to do everything,

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:49.689
you would have to treat
the photon states.

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:53.970
Here, we treated this
as a wave coupled

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:57.620
to the quantum system
of the molecule.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.810
You could treat the photons
themselves as quanta

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:04.790
and do quantum mechanics of
the photon field on that.

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:08.210
And that would be a wave that
you could calculate things more

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.529
completely .

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:12.960
But this is not what we do now.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.520
Any other questions?

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.170
Yes?

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:18.104
AUDIENCE: So physically, are
the nitrogen molecules all

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:21.038
fixed in the same orientation
going in to this device?

01:09:21.038 --> 01:09:22.029
How does that happen?

01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:23.184
PROFESSOR: Are the what?

01:09:23.184 --> 01:09:25.600
AUDIENCE: The molecules all
fixed in the same orientation?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:30.229
Essentially it's not
quite like an orientation.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:31.530
It's an energy eigenstate.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.430
So basically what
you have to do is

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:41.270
have this beam of
ammonia molecules

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:44.399
and do this beam splitter
that we talked about

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.399
with the electric field.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:49.399
And you split the beam into
some that are all excited,

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:51.170
and some that are ground.

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.670
And that's it.

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.063
You need that everything that
enters here is excited state.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.140
OK.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:05.280
So another time
dependent problem

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.890
that we're going to discuss
today and continue next time

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:15.920
is the NMR problem,
nuclear magnetic resonance.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.425
So this is a pretty
interesting problem.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.295
Our nuclear magnetic resonance.

01:10:23.295 --> 01:10:28.550
And it all begins by having
a magnetic field that

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:33.640
has a big component
here, B0, I think.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.120
It's a good name for it.

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:45.770
B0 Z, indeed.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:51.960
And then you're going to
have some magnetic field that

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:58.720
is going to be rotating here
in time, in the xy plane.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.570
We'll assume that time
equals 0, is here,

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:05.860
and then it's rotating with
some angular frequency omega.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:11.680
So the total magnetic
field is B0 Z hat

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.580
plus some number, B 1--
I'll write it here--

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:29.560
plus B 1 cosine omega t times
x hat minus sine omega t times

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.936
y hat.

01:11:31.936 --> 01:11:39.170
So, indeed, in the xy
plane, seen like this,

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:43.280
you have it here and it's
rotating with angular frequency

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.820
omega this way, clockwise.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:49.050
All right.

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:51.540
So we have this magnetic field.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.500
And of course we're going
to try to figure out

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.670
what spins do in it.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:12:00.170
And the magnetic field
is time dependent.

01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:06.710
So we're in risk of getting
a time dependent Hamiltonian.

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.590
So what is the Hamiltonian?

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.520
This possibly time
dependent, it's

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.520
supposed to be minus
gamma B times the spin.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.160
So what is that?

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:38.410
It's minus gamma B0 Sz--
The z component matches

01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:48.040
with the z component of the
spin-- plus B1, Sx cosine omega

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.520
t minus Sy sine omega t.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.050
And, well, it's as bad as you
could imagine, pretty much.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.460
This Hamiltonian
is time dependent.

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:11.170
And there's some good news if
even if it's time dependent,

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.210
they commute at different times.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:15.620
The time evolution is EC.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.590
But no, they don't commute
at different times.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:25.290
Time equal 0, for example,
you have Sz and Sx,

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.800
but at a later time,
you will have Sz and Sy,

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.840
and they just don't commute.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.610
So we have no cookbook
recipe to solve this problem.

01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:42.560
We have to figure it out.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.490
And there are several
ways to figure it out.

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:48.590
I had a way to figure
it out that I explained

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:53.760
in previous years, but
today I suddenly thought

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.670
I could explain it in a
different way that is maybe

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:02.300
a little harder
conceptually, but explains

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.950
more of what's going on.

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:09.070
So this is what I
want to try to do now.

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:13.130
And basically what
we're going to try to do

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:19.560
is get the main intuition
going for this problem.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.480
I have the Schrodinger
equation for this problem that

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.810
is very complicated with a
time dependent Hamiltonian.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:31.210
So if you have a wave
function-- and now

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:33.740
I'm going to be a little
rough for a little while.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:37.365
A h-bar D T H psi.

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.300
And it-- oops.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.700
What is it?

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:52.515
Let's see which lights--
Lights, general.

01:14:52.515 --> 01:14:53.015
OK.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:01.620
So if you have a problem
like this, you might say,

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:06.390
well, I would like to do
something non-trivial to this,

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:10.770
so I want to maybe
change the Hamiltonian

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:13.760
and do the same
physical problem.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.090
Now that's not easy, because if
it's the same physical problem,

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:21.400
how can you change the
Hamiltonian all that much?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.940
So one thing you
could do is you can

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:30.910
try to change the states by
doing a unitary transformation,

01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:35.910
and then hope that the
unitary transformation acts

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.960
on this Hamiltonian.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.525
So this will be the new states.

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:45.650
And you would hope that
this unitary transformation

01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:48.590
would somehow, working
with these new states,

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.510
would simplify the Hamiltonian.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.950
But unitary
transformations in general

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.800
is just like a change of bases.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.560
It's not going to
do all that much,

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.940
unless the unitary
transformation has

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:08.360
time dependence, in which
case it doesn't just

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.420
rotate the Hamiltonian
but messes up this term.

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.420
But this is really your only
possibility of fixing things,

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:24.050
is to try to do a time
independent unitary

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:27.450
transformation that somehow
you started with a spin

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:31.770
Hamiltonian, and you're going
to do a unitary transformation,

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:37.280
and perhaps it's going to
be a time independent one.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.230
But this U is going
to depend on time.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.660
And this is not the
whole Hamiltonian,

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.180
because there's a
problem with this part.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.240
So the idea is sort
of vague, but you're

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.210
getting a little of the
gist of what we try to do.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:17:01.860
So the first thing I tried to
do is something maybe intuitive

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.860
about though this system.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:18.870
I could say that suppose
I have a system here,

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.870
and the Hamiltonian is 0.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.780
Nothing.

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:26.060
Nothing happens in that system.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:29.500
Now the thing that this
curious about this,

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.390
that this magnetic
field is rotating.

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:36.910
So let's try to imagine
how would physics

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:43.450
look if you have the xy axis,
and you have the xy axis

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:49.400
rotating with angular
velocity omega.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.820
So the xy in the plane is
rotating with angular velocity

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:54.610
omega.

01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:56.730
What would happen?

01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:01.890
So there's an Hs
that is originally 0.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:06.480
You say it's 0, and any
spin state stays there.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.970
There's no time evolution.

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:09.940
H is equal to 0.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:14.210
Nevertheless, if you jump
into this rotating frame,

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:17.700
all the spin states that
were static, for you

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.890
they're rotating.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:23.350
And in fact, for you, they are
processing around the z-axis

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:26.370
if you're in the rotating frame.

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:29.180
Therefore, in the
rotating frame,

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:33.360
you must have some Hamiltonian,
even though there's

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.850
no Hamiltonian in
the static frame.

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:40.960
Because in the rotating frame,
you feel things spinning.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.130
So in the rotating
frame, if there's

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.120
a static spin along
the x direction,

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.380
you now see it spinning around
the z-axis with frequency

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:56.450
omega, in fact, going
the plus z direction.

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:59.430
So in the rotating
frame you can ask,

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.310
what is the new Hamiltonian
in the rotating frame?

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.450
I mean, the rotating
frame, the Hamiltonian

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:18.070
should be such that it rotates
the spins with angular velocity

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:20.650
omega around the z-axis.

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:25.470
You may recall that this is
done by all the unitary operator

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:33.040
E to the minus i omega
t Sz hat over h-bar.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.740
This is the operator
that rotates, spins,

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.460
with omega t around
the z direction, which

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.150
is precisely what you want
this Hamiltonian to do.

01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:52.490
So the Hamiltonian must
be e to the minus i ht.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:57.920
So this rotating Hamiltonian
must be omega Sz hat.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.360
So the Hamiltonian
in the new frame

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.470
is that because that Hamiltonian
produces the rotation of states

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:11.270
that you see because your
friend that is not rotating

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.710
is telling you that
no state is moving.

01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:15.430
H is 0.

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.610
So the intuition is
that you've passed

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:19.620
from the original
[INAUDIBLE] to this one,

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.440
and you have to add 6 this.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.240
But what we'll see
now is that you

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.000
have to add the
little-- you have

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.705
to do other things a little
if this is not equal to 0.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.360
Here is what we want to do.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.530
Now there's also a couple
of ways of doing this,

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:44.090
but let me try a
little calculation

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.710
to do this second part.

01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:52.150
So, we're going to take,
therefore, to have,

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:57.040
for example of psi R a
rotating wave function

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.760
that is going to be given
by a unitary operator

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.640
times the physical wave
function you want to solve.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.340
This is what you
want, and this is

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.220
what you hope has a
simpler dynamics, psi R.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.400
So, let's try to figure
out what is the Schrodinger

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.770
equation for psi R if
you know the Schrodinger

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:22.430
equation for psi.

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:30.600
So, I dt I h-bar dt
psi is equal to Hs psi,

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.810
let's see what is the
Schrodinger equation satisfied

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:36.220
by this one.

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:47.590
So I h-bar dt of psi R
is I h-bar dt of U psi.

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:50.450
So let's differentiate this.

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:56.860
This is I h-bar dt of U,
and I will have the psi.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:02.480
But then I will put them a U
dagger, there and another U

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.980
acting on psi so that
it gives me psi R.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.530
So the first derivative is
acting just on the U. I acted,

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:18.560
and then I put U dagger U
and recreated the psi R.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.310
The other terms is
in which it acts

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:25.770
on psi, so I get plus I h-bar.

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:28.520
The U goes away,
and now we get dt

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:36.580
of psi, which is I h-bar
dt of psi is Hs I psi,

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.060
so I must delete this.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.040
So the second term,
when I acted here,

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.280
I act with the whole thing.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.070
I ddt, I h-bar ddt on psi.

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:54.240
The U is out, and I put Hs psi.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.120
And here, I can, of
course, put a U dagger U

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:04.590
and put back the psi R,
so I will do that as well.

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.690
U dagger psi R.

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:16.280
So actually you have now a
the Schrodinger equation which

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:22.870
is of the form I
h-bar dt of psi R

01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:31.710
is equal to U Hs U
dagger plus I h-bar

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:43.250
dt of U U dagger of
psi R. Now that's it.

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.530
This is the new Hamiltonian.

01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:49.940
This is the rotating
Hamiltonian, essentially,

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.770
that we're trying to figure out
that is going to be simpler,

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:55.140
we hope.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:59.350
And there we go here.

01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:02.860
We have this similarity
transformation

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:07.340
of the Hamiltonian and
we have this extra term.

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.620
Now suppose the original
Hamiltonian had been 0.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:15.130
We want the new Hamiltonian,
given our argument,

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:19.770
to be a this for the
rotating systems.

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:26.440
So I will say that
this U is such

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:34.170
that you get I h-bar dt U
U dagger being precisely

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:37.780
omega Sz.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:48.235
And for that the U is nothing
else but e to the minus I omega

01:24:48.235 --> 01:24:57.840
tSz over h-bar, which is in fact
that thing that we had there.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.536
So that's what U is.

01:25:01.536 --> 01:25:09.030
And in that way, this whole
term becomes just omega Sz hat.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:13.670
So we're almost, in a
sense, done with this thing,

01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:18.850
because we have made
some good progress.

01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:22.320
Except that we still don't know
if everything has worked out

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.660
or not.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:27.700
I'll continue here.

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:33.460
And just one minute to
close up the discussion

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.180
by saying what has happened.

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:43.830
So, what has happened is that
we have found that there's

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:57.870
a new Hamiltonian, HR equal U
Hs U plus I h-bar dtU U dagger.

01:25:57.870 --> 01:26:03.870
And then U is given by e
to the minus I omega tSz

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:07.190
hat over h-bar.

01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:20.000
And psi-- as we
said, psi of t is

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:30.440
equal to e to the I omega tSz
hat over h-bar psi R of t.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:37.880
So this came because we
said that psi R was going

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:43.420
to be U psi, and therefore
I took U and the inverse

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.230
and you get this.

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:49.120
So look what the
problem has turned into.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.760
It has turned into
a problem for psi R

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.000
with a Schrodinger equation
that has a Hamilton HR in which

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.370
in this piece is very simple.

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:04.498
It's omega Sz hat.

01:27:04.498 --> 01:27:08.800
And now the crucial
point is whether-- here I

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:17.550
have U dagger-- whether this
thing is time independent.

01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:20.160
And this should be
time independent

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.810
if we got our physics right,
and that's exactly where we'll

01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:29.010
take on the next time, and
prove that it's time independent

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.960
and then we can solve
the complete problem.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.680
All right, there will be
notes posted on this soon.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.830
Good luck finishing
your homework,

01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:42.400
and I think Monday is a holiday.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.230
Is that right?

01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:45.020
Well, no class Monday.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.270
We'll see you on Wednesday.

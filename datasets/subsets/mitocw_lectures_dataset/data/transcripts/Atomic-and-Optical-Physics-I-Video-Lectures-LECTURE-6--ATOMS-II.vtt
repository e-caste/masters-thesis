00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.590
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.780
So last week, we started
our discussion of atoms.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.210
So these are, of
course, the key players

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.740
in a course of atomic physics.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.120
And we will reveal the structure
of atoms going from the larger

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.120
energies to the
smaller energies.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.940
That means we start with
electronic energies mainly

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.960
determined by Coulomb energy.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.820
And then we go to
finer levels which

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.780
are fine structure, hyperfine
structure, Lamb shift, and all

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.300
that.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.670
So we have started last week
to discuss the Schrodinger

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.970
equation, discuss
hydrogenic energy levels,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.440
and I pointed out some important
results on typical length

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.450
scales and the scaling
of the wave function.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.060
We will meet that later today.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.250
But before I continue
with atomic structure,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.060
I want to start today
to discuss the units.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.860
The atomic units we are
using to describe the atom.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.640
So the nat-- and for
every problem in physics,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
you have what one may
call natural units.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.680
And for us these are also
called the atomic units.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.200
So what are atomic units?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.850
Well, atomic units are the
units for length, for energy,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.310
for velocity, for
electric field.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.850
And all of these
units, you should

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.960
be able to construct them
out of fundamental constants.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.440
The fundamental constants
which appear in the Schrodinger

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.610
equation for the
electron within the atom

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.190
are the charge of the electron,
the mass of the electron,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.690
and h-bar.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.760
Now, is there any other
fundamental constant

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.395
we should include here to
construct our natural units?

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.110
c, good question.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.368
What about c?

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:44.910
The speed of light.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.090
Should the speed
of light be part

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.930
of our system of atomic units?

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.060
Let's not go there.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.150
Because if you set it to
one, you have made a choice.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.440
You have constrained
your system.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.030
And you're almost obscuring the
fact whether it should appear

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.330
or not.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.710
Well, the strong message
I want to give you

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.232
is at the level of
electronic structure,

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.940
at the level of the
Schrodinger equation,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.600
it should not be there.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.230
Because we are
talking at this point

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.680
about solutions
of the Schrodinger

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.190
equation, the hydrogenic levels.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.720
And there is no c, no speed
of light in the Schrodinger

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.980
equation.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.830
So c is not part of the
fundamental constants

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.780
we have to consider now.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.870
It will later come in the
fine-structure constant,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.870
but this is a different story.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.750
So we have three
units, e, m, and c.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.360
And you can just play
the game of combinatorics

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.480
and see can you
find a length which

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.520
consists of those three units.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.030
And, well, it's h
squared, m over e squared.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.200
This is how you get
the unit of length.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.930
And this length is
called the Bohr radius.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.860
And indeed, this is
sort of the RMS size

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.165
of the electron in the 1s state.

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:24.830
You can play the
game again and ask,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.460
can we construct an energy?

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.050
Well, you find that if
you take e to the four,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.560
if you take the mass and
finally divide by h square,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.910
then you have a unit of energy.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.310
And this unit of
energy turns out

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.930
to be one Hartree or 27.2
electron volts or two Rydbergs,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.690
twice the binding energy of
the electron in the 1s state.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.900
And we had some discussion last
week that the factor of two

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.600
reflects the virial theorem.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.380
This is actually that one
Hartree is the Coulomb energy

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.340
of the electron in the 1s state,
which is the binding energy.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.690
But then half of it
is kinetic energy.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.010
And, therefore, the total
energy of the 1s electron

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.950
is half the Coulomb energy.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.570
And it's that.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.350
But no.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.150
OK, so, so far no c.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.190
The energy, the energy
levels, the wave function.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.810
If there is no c, no speed
of light in the Schrodinger

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.070
equation, there is no c in the
solution of the Schrodinger

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.540
equation.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.510
And if you set it 1, sure,
it wouldn't-- I mean,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.790
if your relativity
equation said c equals 1,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.740
you obscure the fact.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.070
But here, it's
definitely not there.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.485
But now we can also
see, well, there

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:56.120
are other important energies.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.350
One energy, and now
I bring in the c

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.570
just because I want to
compare two energies which

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.820
include the speed of light, the
rest energy of the electron.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.820
Or a very fundamental unit
of length is h-bar over mc.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.460
Which is the
Compton wavelengths.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.230
So that's lambda Compton,
the Compton wavelengths

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.540
of the electron.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.320
And, well, if we
try to figure out

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.440
what is the ratio of the
atomic unit of lengths.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.310
And the Compton radius,
we have to multiply

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.420
with a dimensionless unit
which is hc over e squared.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.430
Or if I take the reverse,
e squared over hc, h-bar c.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.130
And similarly, here the
dimensionless quantity

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.110
to multiply is that.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.690
So what do we find now here
is we find that what we get

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.944
is a quantity which
I want to call alpha,

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:07.110
the fine-structure constant.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:17.210
And what I find here is the same
constant, alpha to the minus 1,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.795
times the Compton wavelengths.

00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:26.470
Let me discuss the
fine-structure constant

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.750
in a second, but there's
still two more atomic units

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.330
we want to discuss.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.280
There is the velocity and
there is the electric field.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.290
I can simply get the
velocity by saying, well,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.720
the velocity enters the
kinetic energy in mv square.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.670
And if I said mv square, I want
to skip all factors of unity.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.530
So that's not one half,
it's just mv square.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:08:02.280
And if I said mv square
equal to one Hartree,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.260
then I find that the
atomic unit of velocity

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.080
is e squared over h-bar.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:18.960
But this turns out
to be alpha times c.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.780
So again, what we find is alpha,
the fine-structure constant.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.630
Alpha is, of course,
dimensionless.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:37.809
It is 1/137.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:45.300
So therefore, we see that if the
velocity-- and this is actually

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.200
the orbital velocity
of the 1s electron.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.190
If this is alpha
times c that confirms

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.379
that the electron
non-relativistic.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:58.337
We have solved the
non-relativistic Schrodinger

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.050
equation for it.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:05.800
And consistently, we find that
the velocity of the electron

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.072
is 1/137 of the speed of light.

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:12.280
It's actually physics trivia.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.820
If somebody asks you
how fast is the electron

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.640
in the hydrogen atom, about
1% of the speed of light.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.825
Of course, if you had solved
the non-relativistic Schrodinger

00:09:23.825 --> 00:09:25.170
equation.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:31.050
And you solve it for, let's
say, a naked uranium nucleus

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:37.500
where z, the charge
of the nucleus, is 92,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.390
then you find that this
fine-structure constant times

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.930
z is on the order of unity.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.490
You would find that the electron
moves at the speed of light.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.190
And then you realize, gosh,
I've solved the wrong equation.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.230
Because a non-relativistic
Schrodinger equation

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.885
when the solution
is that something

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:56.620
moves at the speed
of light, I'd better

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.270
start with a different equation.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.590
But here, we find
we are consistent.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:11.830
An electron in the hydrogen
atom for low nuclear charges

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.650
of a few hydrogen, helium,
and so on is non-relativistic.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.720
So let's just finish that.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.610
The electric field
is the electric field

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.360
felt by the electron
which orbits

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.210
the nucleus on the 1s shell.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:38.900
And this is 5.1 times 10 to
the 9 volts per centimeter.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.080
So everything I've constructed
here out of the three

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.990
fundamental
constants, e, m, and h

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.720
are typical for the 1s
electron for the ground

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.280
state of hydrogen.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.460
We got the typical
lengths, the Bohr radius,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.710
the typical energy, the
Hartree, the typical velocity,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:04.770
which doesn't have a name,
and the electric field

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.490
experienced by this electron.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.955
So let's now talk about alpha.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.720
So alpha is dimensionless.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.990
It is, you know, if a constant
has dimension like h-bar,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.860
like c, actually the
value of it reflects

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.550
our system of metrology.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.080
If you define the second
in a different way,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.790
h-bar will change.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.920
c will change.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.290
So a lot of constants are
not fundamental constants,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.910
being fundamental to
the physics at hand.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.300
They are more kind
of translating

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.730
our metrological system
into the equations

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.330
we use to describe our system.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.030
But if something
has no dimension,

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.920
it is not related to a unit
like the kilogram or the second,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.000
it has really
fundamental importance.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.550
So, therefore, alpha is
the fundamental constant

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.445
in atomic physics.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.660
And if you have a
fundamental constant,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.490
ultimately, there should
be a theory of everything

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:39.680
which should ultimately
predict the value of alpha.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:49.880
Which, ultimately, we
predicted by a complete theory.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:03.900
So alpha, the fine-structure
constant, is smaller than 1.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.910
It's 1/137.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.840
And the fact that
alpha is smaller like 1

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:17.230
is often phrased in these words.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.990
That since alpha is
much smaller than 1

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:29.230
that this implies the
electromagnetic interactions

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.750
are weak.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.960
OK, I want to explain that.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.240
I mean, I've heard
this many, many times.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.240
But what does it mean
interactions are weak?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.300
So let me give you sort
of my, in 90 seconds,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.840
sort of my spiel on it.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.735
Why does alpha mean that the
electromagnetic interactions

00:13:50.735 --> 00:13:52.570
are weak?

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.190
Well, we have to compare the
electromagnetic interaction

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.210
to something else.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.120
And the result will be for
this situation I create,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.010
the electromagnetic
interactions are weak.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.160
Electromagnetic interactions
of the Coulomb field

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.410
gets, of course,
stronger, and stronger,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.960
and stronger the closer you
move two charges together.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.580
So what does it mean that the
Coulomb interaction is weak?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.750
Weaker compared to
strong interactions

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.370
or other interactions.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.680
Well, let me try to
justify it as follows.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.210
We cannot go to epitary
small distances.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.870
We can do it in
classical physics,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.250
but not in quantum physics.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.390
So if you go to very
small distances,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.740
if you localize
particles very tightly,

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.520
they have a lot of
momentum uncertainty.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.430
The momentum uncertainty
means energy uncertainty.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.650
And the energy
uncertainty may mean

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.040
that we can create electrons
and positron pairs.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.230
So the moment we have
an energy uncertainty,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.390
by our definition of bringing
two particles close together,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.130
and this energy uncertainty
is larger than the rest mass,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.380
we have to be very careful.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.630
We can no longer use a
single particle description,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.980
or our concept of
single particle physics

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.560
breaks down if you have
seen the particles prepared

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.210
with an energy uncertainty,
which would spontaneously

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.100
create more particles.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:35.740
So therefore, let me
postulate that our picture

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.050
how we think about
those interactions,

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.390
arranging two charges
and writing down

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.430
what the Coulomb energy is.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:57.730
That if energy uncertainties
become on the order of the rest

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:09.470
energy, then the concept of
single particles breaks down.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.490
Of course, that's not
the end of physics.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.420
You need now a field theory
for particles where particles

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.923
are just excitations
in your field.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.290
But here in atomic
physics, you want

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.550
to describe an electron
bound to a nucleus.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.870
And we want to use
those concepts.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.650
So let's just sort of say,
what does it mean with delta e

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.680
is mc squared?

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.620
Well, that means the
momentum uncertainty

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.140
is on the order of mc.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.250
And with this
momentum uncertainty,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:56.140
I can localize particles
to within h-bar over mc.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.685
And this just turns
out to be the Compton

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.490
radius of the electron.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.960
So, therefore, I
should be careful

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.069
when I talk about the Coulomb
energy between particles

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.030
if I would go closer
than the Compton radius.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.920
So, therefore, let me compare
now the Coulomb interaction

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.109
at the Compton radius
to something else.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:24.170
So these Coulomb energy is
e squared over the radius.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.270
The Compton radius.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:34.810
And this turns out to be
e squared, mc over h-bar.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.370
So unless I want to
get into quantum field

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:49.230
theory of particles, before I
need a different description,

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.210
the strongest
Coulomb interaction

00:17:52.210 --> 00:18:04.550
I can create by putting two
particles at the Compton radius

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.080
is that.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.780
And I can now compare
this Coulomb interaction,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:16.020
the Coulomb energy, to the
rest energy, mc squared.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.660
And, well, if I take what I had
above, e squared mc over h-bar,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.150
I divide by mc squared.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.200
I find that e square, that
the result, the ratio,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.880
is e squared over h-bar c.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.500
And this is just alpha.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.750
So in other words, what
I've shown to you, if you

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.450
try to bring two
charges as close as

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.900
possible before spontaneous
pair production sets in, then

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.410
you find that the
Coulomb energy is not

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.390
in the dominant
energy in the system.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.000
The dominant energy
is the rest energy,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.060
is the mass of the
electron itself.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.820
And the ratio of those
two energies at this point

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.420
is, of course, completely
independent of what

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.670
metrological system you use
for energy lengths and such.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.390
It's really something which
says something fundamental

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.720
about the nature of interaction.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:22.650
And what I just presented to
you leads to the statement

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.870
that the Coulomb interaction,
the electromagnetic

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.160
interaction, is weak.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.475
Because the
fine-structure constant

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:30.600
is much smaller than unity.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.680
Of course, if you use a nucleus
of uranium, naked uranium,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.610
and people have ion traps where
they create uranium 92 plus

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.880
and then they add
an electron, you're

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.970
really studying very
interesting physics.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.920
You're studying the physics
of an electron for which

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.130
the effective
fine-structure constant is

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.640
on the order of unity.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640
And that's why people are
very interested in it.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.210
And that's one area
of current research.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.690
Any questions?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.330
OK, so that's our little
excursion about units.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:32.010
Let's talk now about
some general properties

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.485
of one electron
atoms with cores.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.820
A lot of research in our field
is done with alkali atoms.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:52.070
Alkali atoms are not
the hydrogen atom.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.450
But they have one
outer electron.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.500
So they are hydrogen-like.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.230
And now we want to
sort of figure out

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.800
what is the main
difference because

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.650
for one outer electron
in rubidium and sodium.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.030
And the electron in hydrogen.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.740
Well, if we have an electron.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.560
And this electron orbits around.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:29.700
In the alkali atom,
there is an ionic core

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.670
which has a charge of a z plus.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.370
But then in this
sort of compact core,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:53.630
there are also c
minus 1 electron.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.830
So the electron, the
outer electron pretty much

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.760
feels the electric field
of a single charge,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.170
but there is a the of the core.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.960
So what I want to
discuss with you is now

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.410
what is the leading correction
to the properties of this atom?

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.840
What is the leading correction
to the hydrogen-like wave

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.356
function due to the fact that
we have an ionic core and not

00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:22.855
a proton.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:33.850
So for hydrogen, we would
have the Rydberg formula.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:47.520
that for principal quantum
number n, the energy is-- oh,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.310
just one second.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:57.960
Yes.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:20.410
OK, the hydrogenic
energy would be z squared

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.375
times the Rydberg constant
divided by n squared.

00:23:48.821 --> 00:23:52.980
I'm confused about the factor
of z squared, which I clearly

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.750
have in my notes.

00:24:09.565 --> 00:24:12.270
I have to read up
something about it.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.840
Let me take it out here.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.500
You know, we have a charge of z.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.940
But what I'm talking
about is one electron

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.030
which is very far
away from the nucleus.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:28.200
And this one electron fields,
in effect, only a single charge.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.696
And so, ultimately,
you would expect

00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:32.070
that the Rydberg
spectrum, if you

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.410
go to higher and higher
end, would actually

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.600
converge to the Rydberg spectrum
of hydrogen which would not

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.130
have the factor of z squared.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.830
I hope I'm not
overlooking something,

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.920
but I'm just correcting
my notes on the fly.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.710
So this would simply be
what an electron would

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.420
do in the Coulomb field
of a single charge.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.770
And the question is, what
is the leading correction

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.900
to this formula?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.670
And I want to ask it
as a clicker question.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:18.540
So that's the effect, that
we have an ionic core.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.020
Does it make a constant
offset to the binding energy?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.805
Or does it make the
correction which,

00:25:31.805 --> 00:25:33.590
of course, is 1 over n squared.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.540
This would just scale
the overall spectrum.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.275
It would actually lead to
a modified rescaled Rydberg

00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:40.775
constant.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:54.940
Or is the correction
higher order in n?

00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:02.060
Or finally, is it
a correction which

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.812
changes the effective
principle quantum number n?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.533
Maybe you know the
answer or maybe you

00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:13.875
want to try to guess the answer.

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:15.125
So these are the four choices.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.100
Of course delta has
different units.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.590
I just used the same symbol
for the correction term.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.490
But depending whether it
appears it has units of energy

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.580
or if it appears in
the denominator with n,

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.648
it is dimensionless.

00:26:51.648 --> 00:26:55.676
AUDIENCE: Aren't these questions
also C and D [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:55.676 --> 00:26:57.300
PROFESSOR: Yes, this
is the first thing

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.820
I wanted to tell you, that
answers C and D are the same.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.380
Because if we assume
delta is small

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.220
and you do a Taylor
expansion of the denominator,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.760
you just get this.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.670
So c and d are
actually equivalent.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.160
And so if I add
up 20 people voted

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.430
for c and d, which
is equivalent.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.550
So this is equivalent
by Taylor expansion.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:43.990
And, indeed, this
is also-- this time

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.080
there's two correct answers.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.470
So let me quickly derive it.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.840
The derivation is short.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.270
And it adds some insight.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.005
We want to do
perturbation theory.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:08.120
And in perturbation
theory, we simply take

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.660
the wave function of the
simplified Hamiltonian

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.495
and ask what is the
energy correction

00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:19.840
due to the fact that we
have a finite core size?

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:29.230
Since the finite core is near
r equals 0 at the origin,

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.230
we only need the scaling
of the wave function close

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.410
to the origin.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.840
And this is r to the l.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.120
And we have n to the power
3/2, as we discussed last week.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.900
So our Hamiltonian is
now the Hamiltonian

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:53.260
of the hydrogen atom
plus a perturbation term.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.520
And the perturbation
term is the derivation

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.480
of the potentially experienced
by the outer electron,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.960
the deviation from a
pure Coulomb potential.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:15.020
So the energy correction,
en, is the expectation value

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:22.860
of the hydrogenic wave
function with the perturbation

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.930
Hamiltonian.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.550
And the only thing we have to
know about the perturbation

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.600
Hamiltonian is that
this Hamiltonian is

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:38.500
localized around the origin.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.610
And then we immediately
find because of the scaling

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:49.590
of the wave function with
n that this is 1/n cubed.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:58.320
And it's proportional.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.990
And by factoring out
the Rydberg constant,

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.480
I can parameterize
this matrix element

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.840
with a quantity, delta l,
which is dimensionless.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.190
So that means that
the binding energy

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:30.140
is the hydrogenic binding
energy plus this correction.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.510
And then to leading
order in delta

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:40.980
l, it's identical
to this result.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.230
And this parameter,
delta l, which

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:50.080
is characterizing a whole
Rydberg series for all n

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.940
values for given l, this is
called the quantum defect.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.260
So people realized early
on in the early days

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.600
of quantum mechanics
before they understood it

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.480
that the spectrum of
many atoms followed

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.790
a formula which was not
1/n squared is hydrogen.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.070
It was 1n minus delta l squared.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.470
They didn't understand it.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.490
But this is, of course,
now the derivation.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:33.560
There are many other
derivations which

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:38.040
you may enjoy reading about
it in our atomic physics wiki.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.340
There's a derivation using
the semi-classical approach

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.810
and using the very
nice physical picture

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:50.130
that an electron, when it
comes close to the core,

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.590
experiences scattering
phase shift.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.020
And this scattering phase
shift is directly related

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.850
to the quantum defect.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.020
Or you can make a
model Hamiltonian

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.930
which is exactly solvable where
the perturbation Hamiltonian is

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.580
not completely
localized at the core.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.100
But it's proportional
to 1/r squared.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.230
And then you can
exactly solve it

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.200
because you have
already a term which

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.860
is 1/r squared in your
Schrodinger equation.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.730
Which is the centrifugal term.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.790
So therefore, the
perturbation is only

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.580
redefining the centrifugal term.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.246
It's redefining what l is.

00:32:31.246 --> 00:32:32.995
And eventually, you
can solve it directly.

00:32:39.135 --> 00:32:39.635
Questions?

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:46.840
OK.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.840
Then let me spend
five to 10 minutes

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.160
on spectroscopic notation.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.790
So the next five
or 10 minutes, how

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:14.570
we describe the
configuration of an atom,

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.080
well, I don't particularly
like to teach it.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.970
Because it's more nomenclature
about old-fashioned symbols.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.070
On the other hand, if
you're working with atoms,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.960
you have to learn the language
how to describe atoms.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.630
And I also know that
an appreciable fraction

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.840
of oral exams there will be
one person in the community

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.870
and say, what is
your favorite atom?

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.550
And what is the
configuration of your atom?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.880
So it's something if
you're an atomic physicist

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.990
you're supposed to know.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.270
So the spectroscopic
notation, the term designation

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:58.170
focuses on the fact that if
you have an isolated atom,

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:02.850
we have angular
momentum conservation.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:10.927
And so we have at least
two quantum numbers.

00:34:10.927 --> 00:34:13.010
Which are sometimes also
two good quantum numbers.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:14.940
We have some approximate
quantum numbers

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.540
where we have additional terms
which break certain symmetries.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:24.179
But an isolated atom
lives in isotropic space.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:30.070
The total angular momentum
of this atom is conserved.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.830
It's absolutely conserved.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.150
It's absolutely
good quantum number.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.739
And the good quantum numbers is
the total angular momentum, j,

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.510
and its protection energy.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:54.040
So in the language of atomic
physics, we call j a level.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.800
It's different from states.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:05.050
So one level has now 2j
plus 1 sub-levels or states.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.850
So usually when we
talk about a level,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.950
we assume the level
has degeneracies

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.340
because there is the
Mj quantum number.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:27.030
So j, you're talking about
electronic structure.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:36.700
So j can have, when we
have an isolated atom,

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.275
can have contributions
from several electrons.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.930
It can have contributions
and these electrons

00:35:53.930 --> 00:36:04.990
can contribute through
spin, s, and orbital angular

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.128
momentum, l.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.990
In many situations,
especially with alkali atoms,

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:21.050
the inner core is
completely field shell.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.780
There is no s, no l
from the inner electrons

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.857
which contribute.

00:36:24.857 --> 00:36:26.940
And all the contribution
with the angular momentum

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.190
comes from the outer electron.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:38.420
Especially for
the lighter atoms.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.800
The non-relativistic atoms.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:49.390
The different electrons
undergo ls copying.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:53.080
In other words, if you
have multiple electrons,

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:58.325
their orbital angular
momentum couple up

00:36:58.325 --> 00:37:01.760
to the total orbital
angular momentum, l.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:08.290
And all the spins couple
up to the total spin, s.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:14.120
So therefore, before we
introduce spin orbit copying,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.070
l is a good quantum number.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.800
s is a good quantum number.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.500
And then they couple to
a good quantum number, j.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.500
Of course, once l and s
couple to j, orbital and spin

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.260
angular momentum precess around
the total angular momentum.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.910
Anyway, I just
want to say when I

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.326
talk about j, what are
possible ingredients?

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:45.460
So let's assume we have an
atom which has total angular

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.520
momentum, j.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.337
And which is the sum of orbital
angular momentum and spin

00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:53.045
angular momentum.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:10.020
And then in this case, we
use a term designation.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:21.250
A level is designated
by a term which

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:28.030
is written as l, the value
of orbital angular momentum.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:34.420
The spin multiplicity, 2s
plus 1 is an upper left index.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.780
And a lower right index is j.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:50.190
And of course if l is 0,
we use the letter s, p, d.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.000
This is sort of the
historic letter designation

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.680
for l equals 0, 1 and 2.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.040
So in other words, if you have
an atom where the total angular

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.310
momentum is composed of orbital
angular momentum and spin,

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.310
you can always
write this symbol.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:15.700
And this symbol is
the term designation

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.190
which characterizes the state,
the ground state or an excited

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.250
state of your atom.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:49.270
If you have the hydrogenic
atom, often you precede the term

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:58.000
by the principal
quantum number, n.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.920
So let me give you an example.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:15.060
If you have the sodium atom, the
outer electron has n equals 3.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.670
It has 0 orbital
angular momentum.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.420
It has spin 1/2.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.360
And 2s plus 1 is 2.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:30.710
And the total angular
momentum is 1/2.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.860
If you go to the first excited
state, you're still in n

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.080
equals 3.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.970
But you have promoted the
electron from an s state

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.690
to p state.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.260
So, therefore, the
orbital angular momentum

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.330
is now 1 designated by p.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.190
The spin is still spin 1/2.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:54.780
But now orbital angular
momentum of 1 and spin 1/2

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.450
can form a total
angular momentum

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:02.915
which can either be 1/2 or 3/2.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:14.100
So if you're asked what is the
state you prepare your atom in,

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.520
you would give it a
symbol 3 doublet p 1/2.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.220
And I've explained
to you what it means.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.090
There is one addition.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:36.120
And sometimes you want
to not just mention

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.570
what is the principle quantum
number of the outer electrons.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:43.675
Sometimes you want to specify
the whole configuration.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:59.570
So this would mean you want to
sort of build up the electron

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.750
shell and say that I have
two electrons in 1s, two

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:11.280
electrons in 2s, one
electron in 2p, and so on.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:18.910
So you use, I think this
would now be beryllium atom?

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.870
1s.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.920
So 1s is hydrogen,
1s2 is helium.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.876
Then we go to lithium.

00:42:32.876 --> 00:42:34.727
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is boron.

00:42:34.727 --> 00:42:35.810
PROFESSOR: It's boron, no?

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.660
OK, so this would be boron.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.010
So what we use is here
we use the products.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:52.120
We use products of
symbols n, l, m.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.600
So to come back to
the example of sodium,

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.220
so sodium is filled up.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.690
As in the first shells.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.840
So it's 2p6.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.230
And then we have one electron,
the outer electron in 3s.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.470
However, let me point
out that this way

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.610
to specify the
configuration strongly

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.420
depends on a hydrogenic model.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.380
It assumes that the electrons
are non-interacting.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.170
And is, therefore,
an approximation.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.290
In contrast, the
term designation

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:38.342
with a total angular
momentum is always exact.

00:43:38.342 --> 00:43:40.050
Well, at least the
total angular momentum

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.270
is an exact quantum number.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.500
Whereas the
configuration is based

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.630
on the independent
electron approximation

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.540
in hydrogenic orbits.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.680
And usually when
you have a real atom

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.770
and you calculate
with high precision

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.530
what the electronic
wave function is,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.640
you find actually that total
many-body wave function

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.610
is a superposition of
many such configurations.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.780
But as long as one
configuration is dominant,

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.000
this configuration
designation makes sense.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.330
Any questions?

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:26.060
OK, so we come back
to the hydrogen atom

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:32.370
when we discuss smaller
features of the energy levels.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.530
Fine structure, hyperfine
structure, and so on.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.890
But in our discussion of
electronic energies, that's all

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:44.010
I want to say about
one electron atoms.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:49.710
So let's now proceed and
discuss the helium atom.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:00.580
So we want to understand now
what are the new effects when

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.090
we have not only one
electron, but two electrons.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:11.030
And don't worry.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.700
We are not proceeding to
three, four, five electrons.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.340
I think to go from one
to two, we actually

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.730
capture the most
important state.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:22.100
Namely, the interaction between
the two electrons and what

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.345
the results of that is.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:31.550
For the helium atom, there
are some excellent treatments

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:35.330
in standard textbooks
of quantum mechanics.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:42.410
One is the famous
quantum mechanic

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.930
text by Cohen-Tannoudji et al.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:54.700
But also the text
of Gasiorowicz.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:07.870
The reason why I have added the
helium atom to the curriculum

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.930
is because it is a
simple system where

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:16.180
we can discuss singlet
and triplet states.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.220
And singlet and
triplet configuration

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.810
is important for population
of inoptical lattices

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.690
for quantum magnetism and such.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.510
Actually, you can say if
you have two electrons

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.080
and they align in a triplet
state or a singlet state,

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.910
one you can say
is ferromagnetic.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:37.430
The other one is paired
and antiferromagnetic.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:41.740
It's the simplest example
where we can discuss magnetism.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.130
So that's my motivation why
I want you to know something

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.410
about the helium atom.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:58.810
So, therefore, let's now
discuss energy levels of helium.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:20.220
And let's just start with
the most basic model.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.400
The helium atom has two charges.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.740
So if you regard it
as a hydrogen problem

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:36.700
and we put two electrons
into the 1s state,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:43.220
we would expect that based
on the hydrogenic model

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:49.870
that the binding energy
of that is, per electron,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.450
is the Rydberg energy
as in hydrogen.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:58.520
But now we have to scale it with
z squared, the nuclear charge.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.890
And this gives us a factor of 4.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:05.530
So we would expect that per
electron, the binding energy

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:10.095
in the more simple hydrogenic
model is 54 electron volt.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:22.770
So that would mean that the
binding energy of the ground

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:29.220
state is minus
108 electron volt.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:45.420
However, the
experimental result is

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:50.610
that it's only 79 electron volt.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:49:01.140
So we find that there is a
big discrepancy of 29 electron

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.230
volt.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.390
Which is really huge.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:10.480
So what is responsible
for this big discrepancy?

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.810
Well, what we have
neglected, of course,

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.250
is the interaction
between the two electrons.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:39.810
So we can fix that
in the simplest way

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.380
by keeping the wave function
from the hydrogenic model.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:48.920
But now calculating the
electronic energies,

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.200
the electron-electron
energy, by using

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.066
the electron-electron
interaction as a perturbation

00:49:59.066 --> 00:49:59.565
operator.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:08.530
So we still use as the wave
function for the ground

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:15.890
state, electron 1
in the 1s state.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:20.460
So 1-0-0 is a designation for n,
l, m for the hydrogenic quantum

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.550
numbers.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.640
And we assume that the
ground state is simply

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.220
the product of two
electrons in the 1s state.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:34.280
So if I calculate for
this perturbation operator

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.970
the expectation value
with this ground state,

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:46.470
we find that there is an
energy correction which

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:52.010
is 34 electron volt.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:51:00.680
So this removes most
of the discrepancy.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:16.390
You can improve on it by
a variation wave function

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:20.270
if you use hydrogenic
eigenfunctions as your tile

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.710
wave function.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.520
But you are now calculating
those hydrogenic wave functions

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:31.640
not for nuclear charge 2, but
in nuclear charge c star, which

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.900
you keep as a
variation of parameter.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:39.890
You find that you find
even better wave functions.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.830
And you can remove
2/3 of these remaining

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.570
discrepancy of five
electron volts.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:49.879
This variational wave
function is left to you

00:51:49.879 --> 00:51:50.920
as a homework assignment.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.155
So where z is z
equals 2 is replaced

00:52:09.155 --> 00:52:11.530
by a variation of parameter.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.540
Anyway, that's all
I want to tell you

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.550
about the ground
state of helium.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.280
It's pretty much
finding a wave function

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.460
which correctly captures
the Coulomb energies.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.900
The interaction between
the two electrons.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.370
But what is much
more interesting,

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.310
and this is what
I want to focus on

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:35.370
for the rest of this
lecture, is what

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:39.200
happens in the excited state.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.800
Before I do that,
let me just tell you

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.540
what we just discussed.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.300
So we have to this
hydrogenic estimate

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:51.840
and eventually the Coulomb
energy raises the energy level

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.520
to what we have just discussed.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.120
But, you know, as the ground
state has no degeneracy.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.970
And so we all talk about
quantitative shifts.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:05.240
However, when we go
to the excited state,

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.930
we will find the degeneracies.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.800
And degeneracies are
much more interesting

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.960
because something which
was degenerate can split.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.410
You have two different terms.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.910
So suddenly there
is richer physics.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:21.930
So, therefore, we want to
discuss now the excited state.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:28.830
So starting again with
the hydrogenic model.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.170
In hydrogen, the
2s and 2p state are

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:37.420
degenerate so we have two
configurations contributing

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.540
to the same energy.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.880
1s 2s and 1s 2p.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.620
The binding energy in
the hydrogenic model

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.900
is a quarter of a Rydberg.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.450
Rydberg over n square and ns2.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.900
We have to scale it by z square.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:04.480
And we find 13.6 electron volt.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.880
But now what happens
is that we have

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:14.040
to introduce the Coulomb
energy between the electrons.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:22.250
And if you do that, it shifts
up the levels in different ways.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.860
So this is 1s, 2s.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.050
This is 1s, 2p.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.110
So why is this different?

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:56.780
Well, you can say the following.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:10.370
You have two electrons.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:13.400
And you have the helium nucleus.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.630
And you first put
in the 1s electron.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:22.410
And now the second electron
when it is in a p state,

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.490
in a 2p state, it's further out.

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:28.110
And it pretty much
experiences out

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.240
there the charge of
the helium nucleus

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.840
shielded by the 1s electron.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.330
And, therefore, it sees
in effect a smaller

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.450
nuclear charge.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.950
Whereas, the two s
electron penetrates deeper.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.450
Gets closer to the
nucleus and will still

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.990
realize that the nucleus
has a charge of 2.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:51.860
And not a shielded charge.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:56.190
So, therefore, you would expect
that the shielding effect

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.580
due to the innermost
electron is more important,

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.530
has a bigger effect
for the 2p electron

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.665
then for the 2s electron.

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.000
So let me just write that down.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.830
So the 2p electron it
sees a shielded nucleus.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:26.260
In other words, what
it experiences more

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.500
as an inner core, the Coulomb
potential of helium plus.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.945
And not so much
of helium 2 plus.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.060
This is due to the 1s electron.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:53.000
And, therefore, the 2p electron
has a smaller binding energy.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:07.900
It's actually comparable
to the binding energy

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.855
of the 2p state in hydrogen.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.348
Which is on the order
of 4 electron volt.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:32.690
And this effect is
smaller for the 2s state.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:37.900
So let's go back to
the energy diagram.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:51.020
So we have now the situation
which I just described.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.110
We have two degenerate
configurations

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.020
for in the hydrogen model.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:01.320
And when we add in Coulomb
energy between the electrons,

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.400
there is quite a big splitting
of several electron volts.

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:13.832
But now, each label
undergoes further splitting.

00:58:13.832 --> 00:58:15.290
And this is what
I want to discuss.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.010
So we are still sorting
out just the preliminaries.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:22.120
What I really want
to discuss with you

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.920
is the singlet
and triplet thing.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.090
But now we are there
where we can do it.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:32.420
So if you have a
configuration with 1s, 2s,

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:37.330
there are two possibilities
for the total angular momentum.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.500
Two electrons in
an s state, there

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.090
is no orbital angular momentum.

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.200
But there are two spins, 1/2.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.130
And they can add up to
1 or can add up to 0.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:53.120
So, therefore, we will
have two different terms.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.760
One is singlet s0.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.750
And one is triplet s1.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:05.840
And this splitting
is 0.8 electron volt.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.800
And this is what we want to
discuss in the following.

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.080
For completeness, but
the physics is similar,

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:18.270
let me mention that the
1s, 2p state also gives

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:19.780
rise to two terms.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:24.406
We have now the total
orbital angular momentum, p.

00:59:24.406 --> 00:59:26.610
Orbital angular momentum of 1.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:30.350
The spin angular
momentum is 0 or 1.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.080
So we have singlet and triplet.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:43.400
And the total angular
momentum is 1 in this case.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:49.410
Or in this case, 2, 1, or 0.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:53.240
And the splitting
in this situation

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.240
is also on the order of a
fraction of an electron volt.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.840
So what we want
to understand now

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:10.090
is why do we observe a splitting
between those two levels

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:12.990
which seems to
depend on the spin?

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:16.290
How can the spin
cause a splitting?

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:23.230
Because the spin so far has not
appeared in our Hamiltonian.

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:24.920
We rarely have a
Hamiltonian which

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.970
has only the Coulomb energy.

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:30.050
And the spin is not part of it.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.660
So we don't have
a magnetic field

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.640
to which the magnetic momentum
of the spin would couple.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.680
And also we have not yet
introduced spin orbit coupling.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.620
But if this is on your
mind, take it off your mind.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.710
Spin orbit coupling is a
much, much smaller effect.

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:48.350
Energies on the order
of 1 electron volt,

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.510
you just cannot get from
spin orbit coupling.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.820
Spin orbit coupling is smaller
than electronic energies,

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.050
as I will explain
to you on Friday,

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.470
is smaller by the fine
structure constant.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.010
So the typical scale
for spin orbit coupling

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:10.600
is maybe 10 or 100
million electron volt.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.880
It's much smaller.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.610
So, therefore, we
want to understand now

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.890
why do we have a spin
dependent energy.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:23.140
Also we haven't coupled at this
point the spin to any field.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:35.680
OK, so we are focusing
now on the splitting.

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:50.980
So we have the 1s,
2s configuration.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.650
We get two terms,
as I just discussed.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:02.180
One is singlet and
one is triplet.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.550
And still using the
hydrogenic model

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.240
of non-interacting
electrons, we want

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.290
to write down the wave function.

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:22.010
So the wave function
of the twin electrons

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:28.870
is we have one electron
in the 1s state.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:36.140
We have one electron
in the 2s state.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.720
But now since we
have fermionic atoms,

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.030
we have to correctly
symmetrize it.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:54.390
So whether we want the symmetric
or antisymmetric combination,

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:58.300
we exchange the two electrons.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.375
So now we have r2 and
r2 in reverse order.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:17.060
Of course, the total wave
function for two fermions

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.880
has to be antisymmetric.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.740
But the total wave function is
the product of the spatial wave

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.770
function which I just wrote down
times the spin wave function.

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:36.330
The spin wave function can be
antisymmetric and symmetric.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:41.460
And the antisymmetric
spin wave function

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.270
has to combine with the
symmetric spatial wave

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.010
function, and vice
versa, to make sure

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:50.080
that the total wave
function is antisymmetric.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.120
And the correct
description for fermions.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.940
The designation here,
symmetric and antisymmetric

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:02.100
for the total wave function
reflects the spatial part.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.690
The total wave function, of
course, including the spin wave

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:06.065
function is always
antisymmetric.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:20.250
OK, so we have two
wave functions.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:27.210
One has a symmetric
spatial wave function.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:34.960
The other one, an antisymmetric.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.280
The symmetric
spatial wave function

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:44.120
has an antisymmetric
spin wave function.

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:53.650
And that means we
have s equals 0.

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:57.040
That's up, down, minus
down, up is antisymmetric.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.730
Where as the
antisymmetric spatial

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:04.550
wave function goes together
with the symmetric spin wave

01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:08.040
function s equals 1.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.900
So this is the situation
which gives rise

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:19.720
to that triplet s1 term.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.810
And this here is
the singlet s0 term.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.330
OK.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.996
As long as we have
non-interacting electron,

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:36.300
the two wave functions
are degenerate.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:44.200
But now we want to bring in the
Coulomb energy between the two

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.460
electrons which we had
already discussed before.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:27.720
And if you calculate the energy
using this as a perturbation

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.880
operator, well, remember the
wave function had two parts.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.670
It was 100, r1, 200, r2.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.570
And the part where our 1
and our 2 were flipped.

01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:46.730
And now if we have the wave
function, the perturbation

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:51.500
operator, we get a
total of 4 terms.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.310
2 times 2.

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:55.220
We have to sort of x it out.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:01.770
And we will then have the
sort of diagonal parts.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:04.450
And we have the parts
which are off diagonal.

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:13.720
And for the off
diagonal parts, it

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.120
matters whether we had
the plus or minus sign.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.350
You know, if you have plus,
plus and minus, minus,

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:20.880
you give a positive
contribution.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.590
But if you connect
the wave function

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:32.700
before and after the
operator, plus with minus,

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.880
we get minus signs.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.920
So in other words, we
have one contribution

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.600
where it doesn't
matter whether we

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.690
have the symmetric or
antisymmetric spatial wave

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.460
function.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.094
But then we have
another term where

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:46.510
it matters whether we have the
symmetric and antisymmetric

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:47.120
wave function.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.940
That's where the plus or minus
sign from the symmetrized wave

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.710
function appears.

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:55.350
So we have two contributions
now to the energy correction.

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:59.010
One is independent of
the spin wave function

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:01.930
whether we have the symmetric
or antisymmetric configuration.

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:03.430
The other one is not.

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.190
The first term is called
the Coulomb energy.

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:09.090
The second term is called
the exchange energy.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:24.630
So what we find is-- we
have to trace back the sign,

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:34.100
but you find that the triplet
state symmetric in spin.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.720
And antisymmetric in the
spatial wave function.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:47.710
Has the lower energy,
is more strongly bound

01:08:47.710 --> 01:09:06.244
because the antisymmetric
spatial wave function reduces

01:09:06.244 --> 01:09:08.410
the repulsive interaction
between the two electrons.

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.870
So in other words,
we do not have

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.300
any spin term in
the Hamiltonian.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.700
It's just that whether
the spin wave function is

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.990
symmetric or antisymmetric,
it requires the spatial wave

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.760
function to be the opposite.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.040
And now when we calculate
the Coulomb energy

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.420
for the spatial or antisymmetric
spatial wave function,

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.370
we find a big difference.

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:44.950
And the big difference
is the exchange energy.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:51.529
So it is a spin dependent
term for the total energy.

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:56.810
But what is behind this energy
is simply the Coulomb energy.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:01.270
So the spin through the
symmetry of the wave function

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:05.626
leads to a difference
in the Coulomb energy.

01:10:05.626 --> 01:10:07.000
And actually what
I'm telling you

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.140
is the explanation why we have
magnetism at room temperature.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.530
It was Heisenberg's
idea when he realized

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:18.050
for the first time what
can cause ferromagnetism.

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:23.160
It was pretty much the model
of the helium atom expanded

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.620
to many, many
electrons in a lattice.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.260
So the result is that the
Curie temperature of thousands

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.790
of degrees, we have magnetism
below 1,000 degrees.

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:37.780
This energy scale is
an electronic energy,

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.050
is in Coulomb energy scale
and not an energy scale

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:43.190
where spin interactions
comes into play.

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:45.530
If it were not for
the exchange energy,

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:50.190
we would not have magnetic
materials above 1 calorie.

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.310
So this is what you see
here in the helium atom.

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:57.650
How speed leads to an
energy splitting which

01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:01.160
is an electronic Coulombic
energy splitting.

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:10.590
OK, let's make it maybe
even more obvious.

01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:15.360
The above equation
can be rewritten.

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:28.780
So this energy
splitting can be written

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:39.390
as a constant, alpha,
plus a constant beta,

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:41.580
times the product of s1 and s2.

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:56.030
Well, what happens is-- let
me just give you as a sidebar,

01:11:56.030 --> 01:12:01.080
the product of s1
and s2 can be written

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:08.190
as minus s1 square, minus
s2 square, plus s square.

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:18.890
s1 square is one half times 3/2,
it's 3/4. s2 squared is 3/4.

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:25.282
And s square is either
0 or 2 depending

01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:27.240
whether you're in the
singlet or triplet state.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.710
In other words, I just
want to with the sidebar,

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.270
which you have seen many,
many times, just remind you

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:38.320
that the product of s1 and
s2 has only two values.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:45.990
One for the singlet state,
one for the triplet state.

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:48.790
So, therefore, if I
have a singlet level

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.110
and a triplet
level, I can always

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:54.410
parametrize it like this.

01:12:54.410 --> 01:13:01.500
And I can make it more
obvious by showing

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:07.690
what this formula on the right
hand side has two values.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:09.480
One for s equals 0.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.820
And one for s equals 1.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:17.520
And this can be
rewritten as alpha.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.930
You find a more explicit
calculation in the [? video, ?]

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:22.890
but it's also just one
more line of algebra.

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:29.320
You can write it in
the following way.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.180
So, therefore, the
alpha and beta parameter

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.920
are just a way of, you know,
you have two energy levels.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.620
And with two constants,
you can always

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.030
describe two energy levels.

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:42.500
Here, I've done it
with alpha and beta.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.960
But before, I did it
with the Coulomb energy.

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:58.896
And the exchange energy which
we obtained in this equation

01:13:58.896 --> 01:14:01.580
when we perturbatively
calculated the integral.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.740
So by writing it as
s1 dot s2, I even

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.990
suggest that the
two spins interact

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.410
like a dipole-dipole
interaction.

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:23.947
But they don't.

01:14:23.947 --> 01:14:25.530
It comes from the
Coulomb interaction,

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:29.410
but it is equivalent to
a gigantic dipole-dipole

01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:31.510
interaction.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.420
So, therefore, the
conclusion of this

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.310
is that what I have derived
for you for the helium atom,

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:50.936
it looks like a ferromagnetic
spin-spin interaction.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:58.015
And, well, it looks
like it, it is actually

01:14:58.015 --> 01:15:02.770
an effective ferromagnetic
spin-spin interaction.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.635
However, the coupling
is purely electrostatic

01:15:07.635 --> 01:15:14.581
here and not magnetic.

01:15:28.494 --> 01:15:28.994
Questions?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.108
OK, yes?

01:15:37.108 --> 01:15:40.100
AUDIENCE: So since we're still
using the hydrogenic wave

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.980
function as a basis,
how closely does this

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:48.290
get to the actual
measured values?

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:51.080
PROFESSOR: The question
is, how close do we

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.930
get with hydrogenic
wave functions

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:55.215
to the actual measured energy?

01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.912
I don't know.

01:15:59.912 --> 01:16:03.130
I don't know the exact
numbers for the excited state.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:05.650
I assume that it's similar
to the ground state.

01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.260
You saw that for
the ground state,

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.790
we had a big discrepancy.

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:12.860
Most of that was closed by
using hydrogenic wave functions.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.920
And just calculating
the perturbative terms.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.040
So you pretty much
get qualitatively or

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.280
semi-quantitatively, you
get the picture out of it.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.980
And unless you're
really interested

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.340
in the absolute values,
you can stop there.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:30.250
But one way to go further and
reduce the discrepancy by 75%

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.840
is to use this variational
wave function where

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.020
you use hydrogenic
wave function,

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:38.040
but you use z, the
nuclear charge,

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.210
as a variation of parameter.

01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:42.770
And I mean, this is,
I mean, it's amazing.

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.270
I mean, you have a
two electron atom

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:46.230
and you use a
hydrogenic wave function

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:47.230
with one free parameter.

01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:50.380
And you get binding
energies which

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.920
are on the order of 70
electron volt accurate to

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.250
within better than 3%, 4%, 5%.

01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.560
But by adding other terms
or using a little bit

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.670
more fancy wave
functions, I'm sure you

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.494
can get further and further.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:16.320
OK, so the last thing
I wanted to discuss

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:24.010
is the new feature
of two electrons

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:30.380
is that we have singlet
and triplet levels.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:42.550
So we have a letter of states
which are singlet states.

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.875
And then, and this is
what we just discussed,

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:52.360
let me just make dashed lines.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:57.520
Because of this ferromagnetic
spin-spin interaction,

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:02.400
we have triplets states
which have lower energy.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.610
So these are n equals
2 triplet states.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:16.100
n equals 2 triplet states.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.400
j equals 1.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.500
j equals 0, 1, 2.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:27.710
So of course, there
are transitions

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:29.800
between those levels.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.276
And form a p state, you can have
transitions down to an s state.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:44.230
The question I have is what
about possible transitions

01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:47.380
between triplet and singlet?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:58.560
So what I want to ask you know
with a clicker question is

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.910
what kind?

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:05.720
So those transitions
here are transitions

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.530
between singlet and triplet.

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:12.980
And the technical term for
transitions between singlet

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.320
and triplet are
intercombination lines.

01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:35.880
So the question I have for you
is what fields or couplings

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.308
drive singlet
triplet transitions?

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:54.280
So I want you to think about the
model we have discussed so far.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.060
All we have is Coulomb energy.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.290
Coulomb energy between the
nucleus and the electrons.

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:02.530
And between the electrons.

01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:03.240
That's it.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.730
We do not put any other
terms into the Hamiltonian.

01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:09.820
And now we have obtained
those wave functions.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.020
We have obtained those
energies splittings.

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:16.300
And now we want to ask are
there transitions possible?

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:21.040
So one possibility is that
we can drive the transition

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.070
with optical fields.

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.100
Let's say our dipole operator.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:32.330
Which many of you have
encountered in life.

01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:39.934
We have already discussed
rotating magnetic fields

01:20:39.934 --> 01:20:43.940
in the first part of the course.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.460
Is it possible to use
both magnetic fields

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.390
and optical fields?

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:53.160
Or the last answer
is none of the above.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.070
It's not possible with
any of those fields

01:20:56.070 --> 01:21:00.674
to create any kind of transition
between singlet and triplet.

01:21:28.562 --> 01:21:36.330
OK, all right.

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:42.660
We have to spend the first 10
minutes on the class on Friday

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.400
to discuss that.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.560
But the answer is none.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:52.375
There is no way how you can get
a transition between singlet

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:55.200
and triplet using
the approximations

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.200
for the description
of the helium atom

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.350
we have done so far.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.720
Since I don't want to end
with such a cliffhanger,

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.290
let me just say, we have
actually a selection rule

01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:13.780
which says, we are not
changing the total spin.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.510
And you would say, hey, come on.

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:18.850
Can't I just take a magnetic
field and flip one of the spin,

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:22.190
go from a triplet
to a singlet state?

01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:27.490
Well, the answer is no.

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:29.540
And let me just give
it to you qualitatively

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.850
and deformalize it on Friday.

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:38.240
First, as far as transverse
magnetic fields, rotating

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.450
magnetic fields, are
concerned. transverse B fields.

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:47.050
Remember, transverse B fields
create some f of the spin.

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:50.490
But both spins precess equally.

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:52.800
So you can never
even classically,

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.400
you cannot change the angle
between the two spins.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.020
When the two spins
are interparallel,

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.192
they stay interparallel.

01:22:58.192 --> 01:23:00.150
When they stay parallel
when they are parallel,

01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:01.400
they stay parallel.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.860
Or to say the
transverse B field means

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:09.650
we have a coupling, sx, sy.

01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:16.190
And sx and sy can be
written as letter operators,

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:18.355
s plus and s minus.

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:24.820
And as you know, s
plus and s minus only

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.330
change the magnetic
quantum number.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:35.530
But they do not change
the value of the total s.

01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:37.480
In other words, if
you have a spin which

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.790
is s equals 1 triplet
state, you can

01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:43.490
change the angle, how
the spin equals 1 points.

01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:45.560
But it still will
be spin 1 where

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.340
both electrons are
aligned parallel.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.640
There is no magnetic field
which can selectively

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.390
talk to one spin and rotate
spin 1 with respect to spin 2.

01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:59.090
And coming to the
other questions

01:23:59.090 --> 01:24:03.250
about optical fields
with a dipole operator,

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:06.510
the answer is also
a resounding no.

01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:12.130
Because the dipole operator
of the electromagnetic field,

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.150
the dipole operator acts only
on the spatial wave function.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.340
Not on the spin part.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.550
So a laser beam through
the dipole operator

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:33.440
can never ever flip the spin.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.640
It only acts on the
spatial wave function.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.780
So anyway, I wanted to just give
you the answer why you cannot

01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:43.470
go from singlet to triplet
state with sort of our standard

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:46.785
operators, with the electric
dipole operator or with

01:24:46.785 --> 01:24:47.790
the rotating field.

01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:51.230
And I hope it was worthwhile
to explain in detail why each

01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:53.020
of them cannot do it.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.940
But on Friday, I
explained to you

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.540
that there is a general
symmetry behind it

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.300
that even more fancy
combinations will not

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.435
be able to do that.

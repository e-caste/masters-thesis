00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.570
The researcher sent me a very
wonderful microscopic picture

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.960
of these microneedles.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.950
And he really wanted
to try to get a cover.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.630
And although this course is
about a camera and a lens,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.210
I thought it'd be
interesting for you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.260
to see the possibility of
creating a potential cover

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.870
submission from a
horizontal picture.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.900
So here is the
picture that he made.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.830
And what I decided to do
was -- I was thinking ahead

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.230
and cropped it, imagining what
the image would look like,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.920
becoming a vertical shot.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.250
There I did crop it.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.210
And then what we have
to do is make sure

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
when we're looking for a
cover to make the DPI setting

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.710
right, which is 300 DPI.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.100
The width of the
image needs to be 8.5.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.480
And we have to increase
the canvas size to make

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.090
the vertical dimension 11.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.340
I then selected a
piece of the background

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.260
and distorted it to make
up for the empty space.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.150
And you can see that
I made a mistake,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.050
and I needed to fill in the side
that I didn't get a hold of.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.020
Eventually I really do
encourage you to consider

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.009
doing these kinds of things.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.289
We're not changing
the microneedles.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.603
We're just changing the
background of the microneedles.

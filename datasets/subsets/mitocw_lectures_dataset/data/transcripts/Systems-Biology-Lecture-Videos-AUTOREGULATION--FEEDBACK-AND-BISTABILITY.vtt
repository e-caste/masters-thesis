00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:22.250
PROFESSOR: So today,
what we're going

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.160
to do is we want to talk about
this idea of autoregulation,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.930
so what happens when a gene
regulates its own expression.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.910
And I think that this
is a really nice topic

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.960
because it really encapsulates
several of the big themes

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.350
that we're going to be seeing
throughout the semester.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.710
So first there's this
idea of a network motif.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.980
So this motif, it's the
simplest possible motif

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.344
where a gene regulates itself.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.760
It occurs more frequently than
you would expect by chance.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.550
We'll explain what
we mean by that.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.460
And then possibly an
evolutionary explanation

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.730
is that this thing may
be advantageous in one

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.660
way or another.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.800
Now, there are two basic kinds
of negative autoregulation,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.820
or sorry, two basic
kinds of autoregulation.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.150
There's negative and positive.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.640
So negative means
that that protein

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.890
represses its own expression.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.570
Positive autoregulation
would mean

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.420
that it is activating
or upregulating

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.814
its own expression.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:12.480
So down here is
positive autoregulation.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.865
And these things have very
different possible purposes.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.740
All right, we'll see
that there are basically

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.300
two things that negative
autoregulation may do for us.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.480
First is that it
speeds the on time

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.494
relative to simple
no regulation.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.660
But the other thing is kind
of an interesting thing,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.046
which is that the protein
concentration is somehow

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:40.545
robust.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.250
And robust means that
it's comparatively

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.640
non-sensitive or
insensitive to something.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.723
And particularly, this
means protein concentration

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.930
is robust to say fluctuations
in the production rate.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.620
In various contexts, we're
going to see how robustness

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.246
is an important goal,
that biology might have,

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.700
a particular cell might have.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.169
And that you would like
this protein concentration

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.030
to be robust to a
wide range of things.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.145
But in this case, anytime
you talk about robust,

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:16.770
you have to say all
right, it's robust.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.020
What is it that's
robust against what?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.810
In this case, its
protein concentration

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.935
is robust, the fluctuations
in the production rate.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.610
Now, positive autoregulation,
on the other hand, in some ways

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.610
makes these two things worse.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.540
We'll discuss what
we mean by that.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.210
But it perhaps performs
some other functions.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.050
In particular, it allows for
the possibility of bistability,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.240
and hence memory.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.570
And we'll explain how memory
appears in this process.

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:52.560
But before we get
into autoregulation,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.930
I just want to do a quick
review of this thing

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.460
about getting intuition
or binding of activators,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.430
for example, to the promoter.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.345
But also how we can use this
thing about sequestration

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:06.720
in order to generate
what we call

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.969
this ultra-sensitive response.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.220
Now, when we talk
about this, we're

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.250
often thinking about
a question that we'd

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.970
like the rate of
expression of some gene

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.460
to be sensitive or
be ultra-sensitive to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.100
the concentration of something.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.290
So if you have x activating
y, then what you might like,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.290
in many cases, is for
there to be an essentially

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.320
digital response, where if
you think about the production

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.060
rate of y as a function
of this input x,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.300
you might like it to just be
very sharp, to be essentially

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.190
0.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.590
Quickly to come up, and
then saturate at some level,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.030
beta maybe.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.390
Now, the question is how
is it that you can do that?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.070
One thing that we discussed
that could get you

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.910
something kind of like this.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.816
Does anybody remember what
the base solution might be?

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:06.190
AUDIENCE: Cooperative
regulation.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.898
PROFESSOR: Right,
cooperative regulation.

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:10.500
So if it's the case that
you have, for example,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.760
a tetramer of x that is
somehow activating y,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.980
then you can get
something that looks,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.600
maybe not this sharp, but much
sharper than what you get,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900
which is the simple
Michaelis-Menten-type

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.600
looking curve if you just had a
single monomer of x activating

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.790
y.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.460
So one solution is
indeed cooperativity.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.950
But I think that there's
another interesting one that

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.180
is this-- second
solution is this idea

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.865
of molecular titration.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.880
I kind of explained the basic
idea at the end of the lecture

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.364
on Tuesday.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.780
But then what we
want to do is try

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.680
to get a sense of what
the requirements might

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.016
be for the bindings in order
to generate this effect.

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:05.890
So what we have is a
situation where we have,

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.580
again, just x is regulating y.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.720
But it's a little
bit more complicated,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.110
because this protein
x, in addition

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.900
to binding the promoter and
activating expression of y,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.730
we also have the
possibility that x

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.340
can bind to something else.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.980
In particular, there might be
some other protein, maybe w,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.125
which combined reversibly
into some complex wx.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.210
Now, for some situations--
in particular,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.310
if we describe this by
some Kw and this by some Kd

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.990
we can ask in what
regime will this

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.460
generate an ultra-sensitive
response, where

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.750
as a function of the total
concentration of x-- So

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.040
we might want to call that
x total, just be clear.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.750
We'd like it that there's
very little expression of y,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.830
and that all of a sudden to
get maximal, if you like,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.004
expression of y.

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:11.420
And the question
is, well, what do

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.375
we need in terms of these
KwKd's, and so forth.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.500
So there are going to be
three different conditions

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.910
that we're going to play with.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.340
First might be the relationship
between this Kd, the affinity

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.810
of binding of that transcription
factor to the promoter,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.165
as compared to this Kw.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.430
I will write some options,
but as always, you

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.465
should start thinking.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:44.840
You don't need to
watch me write.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.724
Don't know again.

00:07:14.724 --> 00:07:15.640
So I'll give you that.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.960
Just 30 seconds
to think about it.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.460
Yes.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.255
AUDIENCE: Is Kw the
dissociation constant?

00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:24.630
Like if the
concentration w times

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.560
concentration x over the--

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.370
PROFESSOR: Right,
so it's the guy that

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.450
has units of concentration.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.420
So lower in both these cases
corresponds to tighter binding.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.599
I'll let you think
for 20 seconds maybe.

00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:02.900
Do you need more time?

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.350
And it's OK if you are not
100% convinced of something.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.200
It's useful to just make a
guess and then we can discuss.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.040
Shall we go for it?

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.660
Everybody have your
tools in front of you?

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.870
All right, ready.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.150
Three, two, one.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.990
So we have, I'd say, a fair
amount of disagreement,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.550
actually.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.010
I'd say we got
some A's, B's, C's.

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:37.110
I don't know.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.476
There might be a one or two D's.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.600
Why don't we go ahead and
turn to a neighbor there.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.808
You should definitely be
able to find a neighbor that

00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:44.220
disagrees with you.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.280
And try to convince
them that you--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.530
AUDIENCE: What's the question?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.430
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.900
No, no, all right,
so the question

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.820
is, what conditions do
these things need in order

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.750
to have an
ultra-sensitive response,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.710
where the rate of
production is what?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:10:04.484
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:10:04.484 --> 00:10:06.900
PROFESSOR: All right, why don't
we go ahead and reconvene.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.714
And maybe I'll just
get a sense of what

00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:11.380
the state of your
thinking is right now.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.963
All right, so once
again, the question

00:10:12.963 --> 00:10:16.280
is, we want to know what
the relationship between all

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.530
these binding affinities
concentrations

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.090
has to be in order to get
an ultra-sensitive response,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.802
where the function of the
total amount of x-- you add x.

00:10:25.802 --> 00:10:28.260
At first, you don't get really
much of any expression of y,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.070
but all of a sudden,
you get a lot.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:37.140
And first, we want to know the
relationship between Kd and Kw.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.140
Let's go ahead and vote.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.820
Ready?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.150
Three, two, one.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.710
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.710
We're still on this one.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.980
So yeah, you could ignore these.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.688
It's just that it
takes me time to write.

00:10:49.688 --> 00:10:53.050
So I wanted to take
advantage of your discussion.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.320
We're still on this one.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.390
Do you guys understand
what I'm trying to ask?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.070
Okay, all right, ready.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.480
Three, two, one.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.130
All right, I'm going to cover
this so nobody gets confused.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.980
All right, so we have
a fair pocket of C's

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.850
back there, but then
some other distributions.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.470
So we've got some
discussion over here.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.240
So maybe somebody can
offer their insight?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.885
What did your neighbor think?

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:33.466
AUDIENCE: My neighbor
thought that at first, there

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:38.784
should be the binding
between x and to the gene.

00:11:38.784 --> 00:11:44.700
So x should bind much
more equally with w.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.435
That's why Kw should be--

00:11:47.435 --> 00:11:49.060
PROFESSOR: All right,
so you're arguing

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.610
that you want Kw to be
much smaller than Kd here.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.910
Because as you add x, you
want initially for them

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:01.691
all to be sequestered
by molecule w.

00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:04.000
Is that OK?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.260
So if somebody's neighbor
thought it should instead be B,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.920
do you want to offer
their argument?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.630
Everybody's neighbors
now convinced that C is--

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.330
So I'm going to side with that.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.280
So the idea here is that
what you'd really like

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.780
is-- The principle of this
is that Kw is perfect,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.220
and then that corresponds
to going to 0.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:44.930
Then that means that
if you plot the free x

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.170
as a function of
x total, then what

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.630
does it start out
being if Kw is 0?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.724
0, right?

00:12:55.724 --> 00:12:57.890
And when thinking about the
concentration of free x,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.380
do we have to think about or
worry about how much x is down

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.170
to the promoter?

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.432
No, we'll say that
so long as you

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.720
have any reasonable
concentration of x, then

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.690
the one x that binds to that
promoter, binds that DNA,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.440
is not going to affect the
concentration of free x.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.890
So we really just have to worry
about how much is bound to w.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.240
So it's going to be 0.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.110
And this is in the
limit of Kw going to 0.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.310
And so when is it that
something starts happening?

00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:34.010
AUDIENCE: 1x is the
concentration of w.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.090
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it's when you get n.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.860
And is it the
concentration of w,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.965
or is it-- maybe we can be
a little bit more precise?

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.340
What shall I
actually write here?

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.030
Should I just write w, or
should I write-- w total, right.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.190
Because the free w is
changing all the time.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.490
And indeed, at you approach
here, the free w goes to--

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.150
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.180
PROFESSOR: 0, right.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.220
So over here, the
free w is equal to wt.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.010
But then it decreases
linearly until you get here.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.360
And now, there's no free w.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.370
And it's at that stage
that this free x is going

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.110
to go up with a slope of what?

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.880
1, right?

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.520
Right, exactly.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.210
All the x that you add
just turns into free x,

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.680
so this goes up with slope 1.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.770
So this is the idea
behind this mechanism.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.210
What I'm drawing is the case
of perfect sequestration.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.990
And in this case,
what happens is,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:46.810
if you look at the
production rate of y,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.886
it's a function
again of x total.

00:14:48.886 --> 00:14:51.010
The production rate in here
is to be equal to what?

00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:53.930
0.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.690
Until you get to this wt, and
then it's going to come up.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.311
And how is it going to come up?

00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:05.435
Does it immediately come
all the way up to maximal?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.244
No, so what determines how
rapidly that's going to happen?

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.185
AUDIENCE: The
concentration of free x.

00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:15.810
PROFESSOR: The
concentration of free x.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.440
And we actually know what
the concentration of free x

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:17.940
is here now.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.470
AUDIENCE: The Kd.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.770
PROFESSOR: Right, so it's
the Kd of the binding.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.110
So this is going to
be some-- so this

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.310
is again a Michaelis-Menten
looking kind of curve,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.610
where the half maximal
here is just going

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.850
to be this wt plus that Kd.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.210
All right, so there's a sense
that this is ultra-sensitive,

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.152
because initially you don't
get much of any expression,

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:49.610
then all of a sudden you start
getting significant amounts.

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.820
Are there any questions about
the basic-- the intuition here?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.680
We still have come back
and think a little bit more

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.096
carefully, kind
of quantitatively,

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:04.620
about what this mechanism means
for the other comparisons?

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.370
But at least, based on this idea
of the perfect situation, where

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.872
the sequestration of
w with x is complete,

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:14.580
then this is the idea
of what's going on.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.930
Is it clear right now?

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.864
Yeah.

00:16:21.864 --> 00:16:26.534
AUDIENCE: What's the direction
of Kw in this situation?

00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:27.480
Is that--

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.040
PROFESSOR: In what
I'm drawing here?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.410
AUDIENCE: What you drew there.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.690
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:40.460
Oh, OK, so the definition of
kw is going to be that kw--

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.127
and this is a definition.

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.710
It has units of
concentration, so that

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.670
means we have to put up--
this a conservation of w,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:52.454
a concentration of x,
the concentration of wx.

00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:53.897
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.982
PROFESSOR: Any other
questions about this?

00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:03.482
Yeah.

00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:05.967
AUDIENCE: Why does the
flow go the free x 1,

00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:08.452
because isn't the free x
now binding with the gene?

00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:10.618
PROFESSOR: OK, right, so
this is what we were saying

00:17:10.618 --> 00:17:14.060
is that there's just
one copy of this gene.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.920
So given that there might
be-- where in this case,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.040
this might be 1,000
of these proteins,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.359
and then it's just not
a significant-- yeah,

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:21.859
in the back?

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.531
AUDIENCE: So whenever
you have a k,

00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:24.739
do have always concentration?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:34.350
PROFESSOR: OK, so in this
class whenever possible,

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.560
at least in the
lectures, we'll always

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.340
try stick with the dissociation
constant, which is the guy that

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.320
has units of concentration.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.030
You can also talk about
the association constant,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.330
and then they also
use k for that.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.090
Horribly confusing, right?

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.008
So whenever possible, I'll be
referring to the dissociation

00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:53.508
constant.

00:17:56.854 --> 00:18:00.354
AUDIENCE: Is that written
a lower case k or a big K?

00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:01.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's right.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.170
No, it's a good
thing that my K's

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.456
are so clearly big
K's that there's

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:08.080
no possible source
for confusion there.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.690
Yes.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.254
But if you're ever confused
about which K or whatnot

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:15.670
I'm referring to,
please just ask.

00:18:18.315 --> 00:18:20.690
All right, any other questions
about the basic mechanism?

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.600
Yeah.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.808
AUDIENCE: Just a correct one.

00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:26.159
So if we take the other
limit for Kd going to 0,

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:28.549
would it be the same--
so free x versus x total,

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:30.215
would it be the same
slope, but starting

00:18:30.215 --> 00:18:32.530
from 0 that should be left?

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.280
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.960
The other limit
of Kd going to 0.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.300
Yeah, this is an
interesting point.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:43.440
Right, so I think this
plot is independent of Kd,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.740
because binding to
that promoter doesn't

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.650
affect the free concentration
of x anyways, right?

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.850
It does affect this,
though, because if Kd

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.094
gets smaller and smaller,
then this curve actually

00:18:54.094 --> 00:18:55.135
gets more and more steep.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.431
Does that answer your question?

00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:03.889
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that more sensitive

00:19:03.889 --> 00:19:05.530
if the curve is deeper?

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.640
PROFESSOR: OK, right, OK.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.300
Yes, OK, that's a good point.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.550
But now you're taking two
limits of things going to 0,

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.841
so we have to be a little
bit careful, because it still

00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:16.950
maybe depends on the
relationship between those two

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.220
as they go to 0.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.370
No, that's fair.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.790
But the idea is that if you're
in this other limit, then

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.735
you end up not having
significant sequestration

00:19:33.735 --> 00:19:39.290
in the sense that as
you start adding x,

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.320
you start getting expression
of that protein early on.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.410
And so then the whole
mechanism doesn't work.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.535
So it's true that in
principle that thing is steep,

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.367
but it was never
inhibited to begin with.

00:19:48.367 --> 00:19:49.950
Because the moment
you start adding x,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.740
you start getting
expression from the gene.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.700
Other questions about that?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.450
Let's try out this next one.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:07.828
Now, this is a question of K--
so this is the binding affinity

00:20:07.828 --> 00:20:13.290
of x to that
sequesterer as compared

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.190
to the total amount of that w.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.220
All right, so what's going
to be the requirement there?

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.300
So we'll go ahead and
give you 30 seconds to--

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.800
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, but don't
we already have what we want?

00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:29.530
What's the more
specific question?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.000
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, so here, this

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.850
is the case where
w went to zero.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.210
Sorry, Kw went to 0.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:36.970
Right?

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.550
And indeed, this works.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.271
And the question
is, in general--

00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:42.020
Kw is not actually
going to be equal to 0.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.370
And it might be relevant
for this question still.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.990
Yeah, because in some ways,
this is the idealized version,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.660
and any real thing
is going to have just

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.910
some numbers for these things.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.840
The question is, will
those numbers work.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.820
Do you need more time?

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.350
Let's go ahead and
make our best guess.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.800
In order to get
ultra-sensitivity response of y

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.072
to the concentration of x,
what is that you need here?

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:42.780
All right, ready.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.735
Three, two, one.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.925
So we got some A's,
some B's, some D's.

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.205
C is not very popular.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.062
OK, so it seems like--
Well, why don't we

00:22:03.062 --> 00:22:04.520
just go ahead and
spend 30 seconds?

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:04.960
Turn your neighbor.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.376
You should be able to find
someone who disagrees with you.

00:22:07.376 --> 00:23:03.715
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.840
PROFESSOR: OK, why don't
we go ahead and reconvene,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.080
and you can give your
argument to the group?

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.420
All right, does somebody want
to volunteer an explanation?

00:23:16.568 --> 00:23:17.510
Yeah.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.870
AUDIENCE: I haven't had time
to test this explanation.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.036
PROFESSOR: That's just fine.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.740
Well, your neighbor
will appreciate it.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.820
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
that the time scale of that

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.660
axis really on the
second graph is

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:36.670
set by how quickly that slope,
the curving slope, rises?

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.380
PROFESSOR: OK. so times scale
I'm a little bit worried about.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.630
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
concentration scale.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.671
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:46.605
AUDIENCE: It's set by how
quickly the second curve rises,

00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:50.871
so once you go above 0.

00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:54.094
That's the only
feature on that graph.

00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:57.503
And that should be in a
Michaelis-Menten curve that's

00:23:57.503 --> 00:23:58.750
determined by K.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.865
PROFESSOR: K, which K?

00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:03.335
AUDIENCE: Oh, the K of the Kd.

00:24:03.335 --> 00:24:03.960
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.760
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.410
PROFESSOR: OK,
right, so I think I

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.368
like everything you're
saying, although I think

00:24:08.368 --> 00:24:11.930
you're about to answer the next
one, although the next one,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.086
I think, is in some ways the
hardest one, so you're ready.

00:24:16.086 --> 00:24:18.430
AUDIENCE: Right,
which we determined

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.774
should be a lot more than Kw.

00:24:20.774 --> 00:24:23.190
PROFESSOR: Right, so we know
that Kd should be a lot a lot

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.582
more than Kw.

00:24:25.582 --> 00:24:31.016
AUDIENCE: And I think that this
should be a decent amount less

00:24:31.016 --> 00:24:35.712
than-- Sorry, so I think that
Kd should be a decent amount

00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:36.884
smaller than w2.

00:24:36.884 --> 00:24:38.300
PROFESSOR: All
right, so you think

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.720
Kd should be a decent
amount smaller than w2.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.250
OK, so you really are
answering the next question.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.440
AUDIENCE: But no, I
think this is important.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.754
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, I
agree it's important.

00:24:50.754 --> 00:24:51.254
But--

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:00.757
AUDIENCE: Basically speaking,
if you let wt become too small,

00:25:00.757 --> 00:25:04.170
then it compares into
everything else, all

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.944
the relevant quantities, then
this feature, which is really

00:25:06.944 --> 00:25:09.686
determining the over-sensitivity
strengths have 0 side.

00:25:09.686 --> 00:25:11.060
That's what I wanted to say.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.730
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.070
I very much like
that explanation.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.110
And since we have it on tape, we
can now play it again in a few

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:25.690
minutes and then-- I think
you're making a very nice

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.840
argument, and actually,
we'll go ahead and even--

00:25:30.302 --> 00:25:31.760
Does anybody want
to argue against.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.259
Yeah.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.980
So what he's arguing is
that what you-- So he's

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.410
actually arguing that
it's this over here, which

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.410
is that what sets the scale
that this thing increases by

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.030
is the Kd.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.980
And you want this
thing to come up

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.950
quickly relative to this other
scale, which is the total w.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.700
So if total w is
just too small here,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.360
then it's not like you get
any ultra-sensitive response,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.280
because you want it
to be low, low low,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.090
and then come up
kind of quickly.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.694
So there's some
sense that you want

00:26:07.694 --> 00:26:09.860
this scale to be of the
order of this scale or maybe

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.630
even a bit shorter.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:17.040
Is that-- and I agree that this
actually one that generates

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.090
a lot of argument an
discussion in general,

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:25.180
because I think that
reasonable people can disagree.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.144
I think this is actually-- I
will side with you on this.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:41.250
But what about this, because you
haven't said anything about KW.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.140
AUDIENCE I think that
combining one and three.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.285
PROFESSOR: OK, OK, fine.

00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:48.160
AUDIENCE: That's why I
was trying to answer--

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.000
PROFESSOR: OK, no.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.860
OK, fair.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.500
But it's just too
many logical leaps.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.320
I think it's true.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.710
And there's a reason I ordered
the questions in this way,

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.720
so that is so this one
you could-- Otherwise,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.390
I agree that if you combine
these things, you do get--

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.256
and which one do you get?

00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:05.332
AUDIENCE: I think A.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:07.040
PROFESSOR: Is that
what other people got?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.820
OK, I agree that actually
you can get to A here

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.490
from the combination
of C and B here.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.940
But it's a little bit crazy.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.520
Is there a more direct
explanation we can get?

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.380
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.756
AUDIENCE: Well, if you
don't have a lot of w,

00:27:26.756 --> 00:27:30.853
then your binding is
too sensitive in a way.

00:27:30.853 --> 00:27:32.436
You'll add a little
bit of x, and then

00:27:32.436 --> 00:27:34.227
the binding will be
all used up, and you'll

00:27:34.227 --> 00:27:36.290
be making y immediately.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.190
You want a lot of w to be able
to soak up a sizeable amount--

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
then maybe in the back.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.318
AUDIENCE: So originally,
I agreed, but that just

00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:52.800
makes you switch, like Evy
said, you can sequester less,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.415
but that still gives you
a sense of [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.415 --> 00:28:00.456
You're more sensitive to
fluctuations if you have

00:28:00.456 --> 00:28:04.970
a lower sequestration capacity,
but it doesn't really change--

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.627
You still have that switch--

00:28:06.627 --> 00:28:07.460
PROFESSOR: Sure, OK.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.610
So I think that this is
actually [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.610
because there are two ways of
having more of this wt helps.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.220
One is that it pushes this
boundary further to the right.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.809
But the other is that it makes
it a better sequestering agent

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:22.850
because there are just
more of these w's to bind.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.891
And if you go and you do
you do the calculations,

00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:28.030
and I encourage you to do
it, what you actually find

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.310
is that the
concentration of free x

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.280
is given approximately
by x total divided

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.870
by wt over K sub w.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:45.370
So what you see is that the free
concentration of x-- and this

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.900
is in the region.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:54.360
This is for x total less
than and maybe significantly

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.030
less than w total.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.350
But the idea is that when
you're in this sequestering

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.200
regime, what we see is
that the concentration of x

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.020
is going to increase
linearly with the total x.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.800
But it's going to be sort
of suppressed by this amount

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.060
here, where this ratio
is much larger than 1.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.200
You want to be much
more than 1, wt over Kw.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.280
And this is telling you how
good of a sequesterer this guy,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.160
this w is, because you
want to bind tightly

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.787
and you need to
have kind of enough

00:29:26.787 --> 00:29:28.828
to keep the free concentration
of x from growing.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.050
Yes.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.050
AUDIENCE: So that's what
I was thinking as well,

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.018
but then I was wondering
if there's too much of w,

00:29:45.018 --> 00:29:49.482
then wouldn't x never bind
completely, but always

00:29:49.482 --> 00:29:50.735
get sequestered?

00:29:50.735 --> 00:29:52.610
PROFESSOR: So this is
a very important point,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.790
which is that it needs to be
possible for the cell to make

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.830
enough x to overcome the w.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.700
If there's so much of the
sequestering protein that you

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.016
cannot even get beyond
that, then you're never--

00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:09.640
It's true that you might have a
nice ultra-sensitive switch out

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.280
there, but you just
can't get there.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.737
So yeah, this is certainly
relevant as well.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.430
All right, incidentally, if you
plot free x as a function of xT

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:35.830
on a log-log scale,
the question is

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.020
what is it going to look like?

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.770
Now we, know that
on a linear scale,

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.330
it looks something like that.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:51.591
So if it's on a log-log
scale, question is--

00:30:51.591 --> 00:30:53.340
And log-log is nice
because you can really

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.270
get the full dynamic
range of what's going on.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.280
If you plot x and
this is free x,

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:16.379
as a function of x total in this
regime for large X and x total,

00:31:16.379 --> 00:31:18.045
what is it going to
end up looking like?

00:31:25.242 --> 00:31:27.230
AUDIENCE: It's a straight line.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.401
PROFESSOR: It's a straight line.

00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:31.900
And eventually, it's going to
be straight line with slope 1,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:38.320
actually, because they're just
linearly related to each other.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.680
Now, down in the
low regime, what

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.880
is it going to look like
well below this region of wt?

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.245
AUDIENCE:You should also get
a straight line with 1 slope.

00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:56.370
PROFESSOR: With what slope?

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:00.420
AUDIENCE: With 1
over [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.340
PROFESSOR: OK, so why
does everybody agree?

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.840
No, we have a disagreeable--
Right, so what's the--

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.976
AUDIENCE: It's going to be
also slope 1, but just lower.

00:32:11.976 --> 00:32:12.850
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.680
So it's actually also
slope 1, but it has

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.349
a lower-- This is dangerous.

00:32:17.349 --> 00:32:19.140
This is why I brought
this up, because it's

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.580
really easy to look at these
things and think that-- Yeah,

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.940
because they're still linearly
related to each other.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.310
So when you take the logs,
it just affects the level.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.950
So you still get the
same slope, but it's

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.950
going to be down here somewhere.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.130
And then in this regime, you
get this ultra-- this thing

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.120
where it goes up suddenly.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.280
One thing that I strongly
encourage everyone to do

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.070
is, in these sorts
of problems, it's

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.420
wonderful to spend
time-- Oh, sorry.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.035
This is log.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.600
Free x log of xT.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.930
It's really very
valuable to plot things

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.939
in multiple different ways, by
hand or by the computer or both

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:04.980
or whatnot, just to make
sure that you're keeping

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.580
track of what's going on.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.400
Because often what you
see and what you think

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.880
is very different
depending on what you plot.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.510
And you'd like to be able to
see your problem from as many

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.718
different angles as possible.

00:33:19.487 --> 00:33:21.070
All right, I think
that we've probably

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.160
spent about as much time
on this as we ought to.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.850
But are there any
other questions

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:32.150
about how this is
going to come about?

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.650
Yes

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.560
AUDIENCE: Are there any
negative autoregulation

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.440
that can use sequestration to
get a switch-like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.990
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
an interesting question,

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.814
although we have to be
careful about-- If you really

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.730
want it to be more
switch-like, you'd probably

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.050
use positive autoregulation.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.960
And I'm not aware
of a case where

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:58.404
this has been combined,
although-- It's

00:33:58.404 --> 00:33:59.320
likely there are some.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.278
I just don't know them.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.829
I'm going to switch gears to
this autoregulation, which

00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:09.120
is something, of course, that
you guys just read about.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.440
And it looked like your
understanding of it was solid.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.719
But we want to move through
these different ideas.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.340
First, this idea
of a network motif.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.500
And this is just the simplest
example of a network motif.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.480
And it's so simple,
we often don't even

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.850
call it a network motif.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:33.850
But the idea here is that
we have some network,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.690
and it has maybe N
nodes and E edges.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.310
And the example that they give,
that Uri gives in his book, N

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:55.760
was 420, and E was 520.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.934
,

00:34:56.934 --> 00:34:58.600
And there's a basic
question that if you

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.140
have a network with N nodes and
then you have directed edges--

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.010
these are edges that have an
arrow pointing on one end.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:11.180
Now, in that case, and if
you allow self-directed ,

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.870
edges how many possible
edges are there?

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.920
Does anybody remember
what this looks like?

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.820
AUDIENCE: More than
20 possible, right?

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.780
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.780
AUDIENCE: There'd be
more than 20 possible.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.154
PROFESSOR: Right, not even in
terms of the actual number.

00:35:29.154 --> 00:35:32.157
Just in terms of N, for example.

00:35:32.157 --> 00:35:36.380
AUDIENCE: Total or
just self-directed?

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.810
PROFESSOR: Total self-directed.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.510
Or Sorry, total directed
edges, total number

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.307
of possible directed edges,
if we included self edges,

00:35:46.307 --> 00:35:47.530
I guess.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.330
N squared.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.060
And you can think about
this in multiple ways.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.730
One is just that, well, you can
start at any of the N nodes.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.350
And you can end at
any of the N nodes,

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.120
and that gives you N squared.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.170
Right?

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.220
But there's another way that
you could-- For instance,

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:03.965
this is Emacs.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.610
It's NE N squared.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.190
You could also think about this,
if you like, as just-- say,

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:20.650
well, as they point out, there's
sort of-- 1/2 N times N minus 1

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.760
is the total number of
pairs in the network.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.449
And then for each
of the pairs, you

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:27.240
can have an edge pointing
either direction,

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.100
so that gives you a 2.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.510
Plus, you can have
N self edges, right?

00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:37.860
Now, of course, these
are just different ways

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.957
of counting N squared.

00:36:39.957 --> 00:36:42.290
But it's useful to just think
about it in different ways

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.790
to make sure that
you're comfortable

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.670
with the combinatorics of it.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:50.136
In particular, because next
week or the week after that,

00:36:50.136 --> 00:36:51.760
we're going to be
talking about network

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.160
motifs in more detail, in
particular the feed-forward

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.660
loop.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.990
And then we really
have to keep track

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.614
of these sorts of
combinatorics better.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.530
The way that Uri thinks
about this is he says,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.340
all right, well,
we're going to invoke

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:11.070
this null model of a network,
this Erdos-Renyi network, where

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:18.000
we just simply say we're going
to assign the E edges randomly

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.039
across the Emacs possible.

00:37:20.039 --> 00:37:21.580
So of all possible
edges, we're going

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.980
to place the edges
randomly and then

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.570
I generate some random network.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.820
So this is basically
what we typically

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.890
call a random network.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.540
And that's going to allow
us to define some null model

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.340
that if everything
were random, we

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.515
can ask, for example, how many
self edges do expect to get?

00:37:49.544 --> 00:37:51.960
Well, one way to construct
this sort Erdos-Renyi network--

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.456
Yeah.

00:37:52.456 --> 00:37:53.955
AUDIENCE: But how
do you know if you

00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:56.672
have other kind of constraints
in the system, how do

00:37:56.672 --> 00:38:02.609
you know that transcription
might require in some cases

00:38:02.609 --> 00:38:03.275
autoregulation--

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.791
The answer that was give that
was a good answer was that

00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:12.152
evolution is the
only thing that can--

00:38:12.152 --> 00:38:14.610
if you find a network motif
that has to do with evolution--

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.660
PROFESSOR: So that is the
argument that Uri makes,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.034
and you're maybe saying maybe
that's not a good argument.

00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:23.449
And what Uri is saying as
well, if you see these networks

00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:24.990
more frequently than
you would expect

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.406
by chance-- and
of course, you can

00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:29.000
define what you mean
by chance-- then

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.930
you can say oh, maybe it was
select for, it was evolved.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.850
And I think that, in the case
of this autoregulation case,

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:37.070
I think the results
are not very sensitive.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.630
But I think that this question
of what the right null model

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.960
is, is a real issue, especially
when you're talking about some

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960
of these other networks.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.918
And what we'll see for
the feed-forward loop is

00:38:47.918 --> 00:38:50.820
that you have to decide-- well,
one thing we're going to see

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.610
is an Erdos-Renyi random network
is very much not an accurate

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.335
description of real
transcription networks.

00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:00.710
So then you could say, well,
that's not a good null model

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:01.720
to use.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.771
And so we'll definitely
spend some more time thinking

00:39:04.771 --> 00:39:05.270
about this.

00:39:08.821 --> 00:39:10.570
In the context of the
Erdos-Renyi network,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.700
though, one way that
you can generate it

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.140
is that for each of
the Emacs possible,

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.140
each of these total
number of edges,

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.040
there is some
probability that you're

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.980
going to actually place
a real edge there.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.659
And that probability is
just E over N squared.

00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:26.700
E is the number of edges.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.040
N squared is the number
of possible edges.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.720
So if you just create a
random network in that way,

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.640
then this is a manifestation
of a random network that

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.320
has at least the basic
properties, the same number

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.740
of edges as our network.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:50.520
So from this, you say, well,
how many self edges would

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.070
you expect in this world?

00:39:55.070 --> 00:40:01.380
And you'd say well,
in that case--

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.760
There are two ways of
thinking about this.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.150
So you can either say,
we're going to take,

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:13.490
for each of the N
edges, there's one

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:18.040
possible self-directed arrow.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.990
And for each of those cases,
we can just multiply this by P.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:27.380
And this gives us E over N.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:33.370
You could also think
about it as-- There

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.387
are multiple ways once
again, of doing the counting.

00:40:36.387 --> 00:40:38.470
In an Erdos-Renyi network,
you can say, all right,

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:44.300
you would expect to get roughly
E over N autoregulatory loops.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.360
And this is of order 1.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:53.320
So this is 1.2, in the case of
the network that Uri analyzes

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.482
in his book and his paper.

00:40:56.482 --> 00:40:58.815
Whereas, how many were actually
observing in the network

00:40:58.815 --> 00:40:59.481
that he studied?

00:41:03.034 --> 00:41:03.950
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.910
PROFESSOR: There were 40, right?

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:07.820
So in the observed
transcriptional network--

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:13.550
and this is in E. coli-- he
found that there were 40.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.730
And the basic statement
here is that 40 is just

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.904
much larger than 1.2.

00:41:18.904 --> 00:41:20.820
And you can quantify
this a little bit better,

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.310
because, it's really you
would expect 1.2 plus or minus

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:29.310
the square root of this, in
a random network like this.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:33.960
But that is, you'd
expect 0, 1, 2, maybe 3.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.620
So 40 is definitely not
what you would expect based

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.885
on an Erdos-Renyi network.

00:41:38.885 --> 00:41:41.010
So this is the sense in
which it's a network motif.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.870
It's that the
observed network just

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.820
doesn't look like a random
network in this very

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.910
particular sense.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.310
And of these 40, does anybody
remember kind the distribution

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:58.290
between negative autoregulation
and positive autoregulation?

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.790
AUDIENCE: It was
30-10 or something.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:00.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
think it was like 34

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.130
and 6 was my recollection.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.330
I didn't write this down.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.190
So most of these guys have
a form of x inhibiting x.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.850
But some had the form
of x activating x.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.809
So this was something
like 34 and 6.

00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:17.100
What you would say then is
that negative autoregulation

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.830
is a very strong network motif,
whereas positive autoregulation

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.610
is a weaker network
motif, but still

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.452
something that occurs
perhaps more than you

00:42:25.452 --> 00:42:26.410
would expect by chance.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.570
Are there any questions about
that where that argument came

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.980
from, other concerns about it?

00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:46.340
All right, then from this,
then Uri says, OK, well,

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.290
maybe these things
evolved for a reason.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:53.690
And so what we'll do in the next
half hour just argue or discuss

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.260
what possible
evolutionary advantages

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.913
such a social network
motif might have.

00:43:00.913 --> 00:43:01.412
Yeah.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:04.196
AUDIENCE: Can you really
propose adversarial explanations

00:43:04.196 --> 00:43:04.909
like that?

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:06.950
PROFESSOR: Oh, you can
propose whatever you want.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.934
AUDIENCE: I know, but it
doesn't have much value.

00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:12.375
It's unquantifiable.

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:13.000
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.090
No, I'd say this is a
major issue in a lot

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.160
of evolutionary arguments.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.690
And I would say that the
purpose of ideas and hypotheses

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.570
is to get you to go and
make new measurements.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.410
And so right now, we're
the stage, OK, well,

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.440
maybe these things are occurring
more frequently than you

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.650
would expect by chance.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.830
So now, we can just
sit down and think, oh,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.450
what advantage might it give.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.800
And then we can go and
try to experimentally ask

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.449
whether those advantages
are at least manifested

00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:40.115
in real systems.

00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:42.430
It doesn't prove that
that's why they evolved,

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.460
but it makes you more
comfortable with the argument.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:45.960
feel

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.702
Ultimately, we assign some--
we have some agent probability

00:43:48.702 --> 00:43:49.660
somewhere in our brain.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.330
And the more
evidence that we can

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.700
accumulate that's consistent
with these ideas, the more

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.510
likely that we think it is.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.100
But in general, you
don't prove things

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.120
in this sort of
evolutionary space the way

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.426
you prove things in
many other fields.

00:44:04.426 --> 00:44:04.925
Yeah.

00:44:04.925 --> 00:44:08.760
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's
hard to call this an argument.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.754
It feels more like
just an observation.

00:44:11.754 --> 00:44:13.670
PROFESSOR: Which thing
is an argument versus--

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.445
AUDIENCE: I guess the thing
is it should be evolutionarily

00:44:18.445 --> 00:44:19.885
advantageous,
that's an argument,

00:44:19.885 --> 00:44:22.010
but essentially, the whole
thing is an observation,

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.340
and then there's a little bit
of an argument in the end.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I will
let each person decide

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.650
what fraction and observation.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.010
Yeah, I don't feel
especially strongly about it.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.980
My guess is that it did
evolve it because it

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.970
provides some useful function.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.210
And therefore, I think
it's valuable to explore

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.830
what those useful
functions might be.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.650
But for example, it's
very hard to know

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.580
which of these explanation--
this thing about

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.800
increasing the response
time, or sorry,

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.690
increasing the response
rate as compared

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.370
to increasing robustness,
how do you decide

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.369
which one's more important?

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:04.160
Then I think, once
again, reasonable people

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.743
can disagree about
these things, yeah.

00:45:11.984 --> 00:45:13.900
So first negative
autoregulation, because this

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.816
is the one that is the
stronger network motif.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.910
I think that the book does
a nice explanation of why

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:27.445
it decreases the response time.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.880
OK, we can just ask.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.370
OK, response time-- and this is
for a negative autoregulation.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.360
Response time goes down.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:59.130
And is this for turning on, off,
both, or maybe neither, or E,

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.220
don't know.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.550
And I'll give you just 10
seconds to think about this.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.470
It's nice if you
just remember it,

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.810
but it's also maybe even better
if you can figure it out.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.821
Because in a week,
you're probably

00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:12.320
not going to just
have it memorized,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.610
but you should be able to
think through the logic of it

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.734
and understand why this
is going to be what it is.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.580
All right, so the question
is, negative autoregulation,

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.740
maybe it does something.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.283
Maybe it decreases
the response time.

00:46:33.283 --> 00:46:34.657
But does it decrease
the response

00:46:34.657 --> 00:46:39.610
time for turning a gene on,
for turning it off, for both,

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.013
neither, or don't know

00:46:41.013 --> 00:46:42.554
AUDIENCE:When you
say turning it off,

00:46:42.554 --> 00:46:44.800
what exactly is the
process you're imagining.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.340
PROFESSOR: I'm imagining a
process where the expression

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.540
turns off immediately.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.110
So there's a signal
that just stops--

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.520
AUDIENCE: what
transcription can go ahead.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.270
PROFESSOR: Right,
so then it's just

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:04.080
I chop up all the polymerases,
and no more expression.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.180
But so a signal comes and tells
the polymerases to stop making.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:07.680
Yeah.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.350
All right, so do
you need more time?

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.930
No.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.270
Ready, three, two, one.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.240
All right, so we actually are
all over the place on this.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.210
OK, turn to your neighbor.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.885
And you should be
able to explain

00:47:35.885 --> 00:47:37.885
one way or the other why
thi-- what is going on.

00:47:37.885 --> 00:49:06.880
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.050
Let's go ahead and reconvene.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.150
I just want to remind
everybody that when

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:15.620
I say simple regulation,
there's no autoregulation.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.140
It's just responding
to a signal.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:24.050
That for a stable protein,
the time to get to say,

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.840
for example, half
saturating concentration

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.210
here is defined by the
cell generation time.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.170
And that's true for turning
on and for turning off.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.810
And what was the
strategy that you

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.550
could use if you wanted
to decrease the response

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:41.344
time in this situation?

00:49:41.344 --> 00:49:43.010
AUDIENCE: Increase
the degradation rate.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.140
PROFESSOR: Right, so you could
increase the degradation rate.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.925
And does that the
on, off, or both?

00:49:48.925 --> 00:49:49.550
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.470
PROFESSOR: Both.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.992
But there's a cost,
which was what?

00:49:52.992 --> 00:49:54.450
AUDIENCE: You have
to make protein.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:55.960
PROFESSOR: Right, you have
to make a bunch of protein,

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.920
and then you're just
going to chop it

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.045
up right after you make it.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:04.540
There is a reasonable-- there
is a way to make things faster,

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.850
but it has a significant cost.

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:08.710
The question is, if you have
negative autoregulation--

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:14.520
so in this case, you have x
that is repressing itself--

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.830
what is it that
it's going to do?

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.664
Is it going to affect the on
time, the off time, or both.

00:50:19.664 --> 00:50:20.830
Let's just see where we are.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.390
Ready, three, two, one.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.200
OK, so it's interesting.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.620
We're moving
towards C, it seems.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.370
OK, so can somebody
give me an explanation

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:44.214
for C. Did we read the chapter?

00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:45.672
AUDIENCE: Well,
the chapter doesn't

00:50:45.672 --> 00:50:48.528
discuss the effect of negative
autoregulation and turning off.

00:50:48.528 --> 00:50:50.432
I don't think it does.

00:50:50.432 --> 00:50:52.360
PROFESSOR: Wow,
it's a good thing

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.200
we're doing that here then.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:55.700
All right.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.760
So first of all, can somebody
give the explanation.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.305
Does T on go up,
down, or sideways.

00:51:04.305 --> 00:51:05.550
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:08.035
PROFESSOR: So T on-- It's
the time that goes down.

00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:09.160
I always get this confused.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.500
So time is the one that goes
down, so the rate goes up.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.101
Negative autoregulation is
faster turning on, we decided.

00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:16.600
Right?

00:51:21.664 --> 00:51:23.580
And does somebody want
to give the explanation

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.340
for why this is?

00:51:27.602 --> 00:51:32.060
AUDIENCE: Well, your
equilibrium level is lower.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:34.605
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:34.605 --> 00:51:36.438
Yes, this is actually
surprisingly difficult

00:51:36.438 --> 00:51:40.290
to explain even though
it's not a deep concept.

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:43.640
But the idea is that you
start out expressing a lot,

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.502
so that if you had kept on
expressing that high level,

00:51:46.502 --> 00:51:48.210
you would have done
some exponential-- It

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.140
would have take cell generation
time from way up here.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.040
But instead, what happens
is that you shoot on up.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.510
But then, once you get up
here, you repress expression.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.490
So then you get an
effective thing,

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:05.790
where the time it takes you get
half of your equilibrium, that

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:08.510
goes down.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.540
So Tl in here is
shorter than here.

00:52:13.282 --> 00:52:13.781
Yes.

00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:16.560
AUDIENCE: So in
negative autoregulation,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.440
for decreasing what
the book calls beta,

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.450
to have the same steady state?

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.450
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.160
The initial beta, that
rate, that maximal rate

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.100
of expression, that
goes up in a case

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.330
of negative autoregulation.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.750
But then you start
repressing expression

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:35.301
once your
concentration of x here

00:52:35.301 --> 00:52:36.550
gets to some reasonable level.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:48.090
So now we're just talking
about production rate of x.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.900
And that's as a function of x.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:56.770
And of this logic
approximation is when it just

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.850
is maximal until
it gets to some K

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.060
and then is
completely repressed.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.370
So real versions will
be much smoother,

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:07.320
but this is just useful to
start getting the intuition.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.780
And the idea is that
you shoot up to this K,

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.110
and then you stop expressing.

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:21.711
In this limit, actually, it's
not even-- it's like a kink

00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:22.210
here.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:26.210
Because it just shoots up
and then it turns around.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.040
But any real system
will be smoother.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.045
Yes, question.

00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:32.520
AUDIENCE: So if you get to
a certain equilibrium level,

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.490
then in autoregulation, you
would need a stronger promoter.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:39.040
PROFESSOR: Yes, you want a
stronger promoter, because you

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.750
really want to have high
expression initially

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:45.700
and then later repress that.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:50.070
So negative autoregulation
allows you to speed up

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.450
turning on, so T on goes down.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.075
AUDIENCE: Without
increasing the promoter,

00:53:54.075 --> 00:53:56.075
which is a good thing,
because someone would die

00:53:56.075 --> 00:53:58.110
if you increase the promoter.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:02.604
PROFESSOR: This is a
very important point,

00:54:02.604 --> 00:54:04.020
which I was about
to get to, which

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:10.050
is that this is something that
was done-- We could have done

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.720
that without negative
autoregulation

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.512
by increasing the
degradation rate.

00:54:13.512 --> 00:54:15.470
So the question the that
we're bringing up here

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.860
is, is there that
same cost that we

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.915
were referring to before of this
futile expression of protein

00:54:20.915 --> 00:54:21.540
at equilibrium.

00:54:24.456 --> 00:54:25.337
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:25.337 --> 00:54:26.670
PROFESSOR: So it's actually not.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.770
In a cell, you start
out expressing a lot,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.440
but then later, you
actually bring down

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.645
your rate of expression.

00:54:37.645 --> 00:54:42.490
And in any case,
there's no degradation.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.140
in this.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.810
The only effective
degradation is

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:48.610
due to the dilution,
the growth of the cell.

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.640
So if you have the
same concentration,

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.179
then actually, you don't
make any more protein

00:54:53.179 --> 00:54:55.595
than you did here, because you
have the same concentration

00:54:55.595 --> 00:54:57.810
at equilibrium.

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.140
So this is neat
because this speeds up

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.640
the response when
you're turning on,

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.249
without the associated
cost of making

00:55:06.249 --> 00:55:07.540
that protein then degrading it.

00:55:11.662 --> 00:55:13.120
Any questions about
that statement?

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.140
So now what about off?

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.300
Is the off time the same
as the on time here?

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:31.741
So what sets how fast--

00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:33.865
AUDIENCE: Should the off
time be slower because you

00:55:33.865 --> 00:55:37.032
have lots of degradation.

00:55:37.032 --> 00:55:38.490
PROFESSOR: Right,
and in principle,

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:42.644
is there any active degradation
that we've invoked on this?

00:55:42.644 --> 00:55:43.970
AUDIENCE: I think not.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.700
PROFESSOR: Of
course, we could have

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.800
both negative autoregulation
and active degradation.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.610
But in principle
right now, you can

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.600
have the negative autoregulation
without any active degradation.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.110
In that case, how long does
it take for that concentration

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:59.989
to go away when you
stop expressing?

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.530
AUDIENCE: The cell
degeneration time.

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:03.113
PROFESSOR: The cell
degeneration time.

00:56:03.113 --> 00:56:05.360
So this thing actually looks
the exact same as this.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:17.000
So these guides are the same,
whereas this one is faster

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.583
than that one.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.380
Because the idea is that the
best that-- unless you're

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.978
inactively degraded,
all you can do is you

00:56:25.978 --> 00:56:27.270
can shut off expression.

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.060
But then if you
turn off expression

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.560
on the negative
autoregulation, it's

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.530
the exact same thing as
turning off expression

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.530
in the absence of the
neg-- in either case,

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:36.170
you just stop making protein.

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.560
So the concentration
just goes down

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:43.140
because it's being diluted
away during cell growth.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.800
So this is saying
that response time

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.530
was down only when
turning off in the case

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.049
of negative autoregulation.

00:56:57.195 --> 00:56:58.861
Are there any questions
about that idea?

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.480
Yes.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.452
AUDIENCE: With the
negative autoregulation,

00:57:05.452 --> 00:57:08.903
in order to reach the
same protein levels,

00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:14.542
you'd need much greater
production rates, correct?

00:57:14.542 --> 00:57:21.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the idea
is that this beta might be--

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.680
so this is the beta of
negative autoregulation.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:29.269
It could be much larger than
the beta of simple regulation

00:57:29.269 --> 00:57:30.935
in order to get to
the same equilibrium.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.600
OK, so what about this
idea of robustness?

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.830
Well, this is production rate
and then degradation rate.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.630
So this is an alpha x.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:59.370
And so my question
here is, I told you

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:02.420
that robustness-- something
is robust-- Yeah, question.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.108
AUDIENCE: My question
is in this case,

00:58:06.108 --> 00:58:11.900
you're saying that the off
means signal disappears, right?

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.960
PROFESSOR: OK, T
off is this idea.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.880
It's the T 1/2.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.870
So this is the time that
it takes for the protein

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:24.999
concentration to
reach half-- to go

00:58:24.999 --> 00:58:27.540
from halfway the distance from
where you were to where you're

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.000
going to end up.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.992
AUDIENCE: But what if
the signal not disappear,

00:58:29.992 --> 00:58:33.870
but to half of the
original signal?

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:37.051
PROFESSOR: So the signal could
do a range of different things.

00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:38.550
And it could be
that the signal just

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.730
changes so that instead
of going down to 0,

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.860
you go down to some other value.

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.110
Is that what you're imagining?

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:44.693
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:58:44.693 --> 00:58:46.900
PROFESSOR: In that case,
you still go exponentially

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.720
to this new value, so actually
the T-- the response time

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.160
there is still actually
the cell generation time.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.130
So it doesn't matter,
in the absence

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:58.000
of any these, for
example, autoregulation.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.160
The time, the
characteristic timescale,

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.000
is always the cell generation
time if it's a stable protein.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.999
It doesn't matter whether
you're going up, down,

00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:07.190
or all the way to 0 or not.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:20.450
So the question here is-- OK, x
equilibrium is robust to what?

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.340
And this is to small
changes in what?

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.752
It's going to be A, alpha.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.410
So this is going to be our
first example of an advanced use

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:55.540
of our cards.

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.600
So the way that it works is that
you can choose more than one.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.575
OK, now, this requires
some manual dexterity.

01:00:01.575 --> 01:00:03.950
So what you have to do is if
you think that the answer is

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.241
more than one of these things,
then what you have to do

01:00:06.241 --> 01:00:07.705
is show me more than one card.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.700
These cards are amazing, right?

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.960
You can do so many
different combinations.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.790
I'll give you 20 seconds
to think about it.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.140
AUDIENCE: So what's e?

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.070
What do those things mean?

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:34.540
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is, are the equilibrium

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.330
concentration of protein x
is robust means it does not

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:42.000
change in response to small
changes in what quantities?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.885
So if I change the
degradation rate,

01:00:43.885 --> 01:00:45.010
does it change equilibrium.

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.380
If I change the beta.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.670
And I'm asking about
this case here,

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.150
perfect negative
autoregulation, just

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:55.060
so we can try to establish
our intuition here.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.840
K is this repression threshold.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.210
None means that it's not
robust to any of these things.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:15.600
DK always means "don't know."

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.130
I'll give you an
extra 30 seconds.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:17.755
This might be--

01:01:34.964 --> 01:01:36.380
So this one's the
production rate.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.452
This one's the degradation rate.

01:01:38.452 --> 01:01:39.910
This figure might
be useful to you.

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:47.200
AUDIENCE: Can you
define K again?

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.190
PROFESSOR: Yes, so K is the
concentration of the protein x

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.970
at which this super effective
repression kicks in.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:00.080
So we're assuming perfect
negative autoregulation.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.600
Beta is the rate of expression
for low concentrations.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.245
The moment you get
to concentration K,

01:02:06.245 --> 01:02:08.328
you get perfect repression
and no more expression.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.621
Do you need more time?

01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:20.120
Question.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.940
AUDIENCE: By saying that
x equilibrium is robust,

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.640
so you mean that when you
change these perimeters,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.510
x equilibrium stays exactly the
same, or will x equlibrium--

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.680
PROFESSOR: For now, what
we'll mean right now

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.255
is that a small change
in this parameter

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.940
leads to no change
in x equilibrium.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.675
Now, for any real example,
what we'll typically mean

01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:46.860
is 's going to be some sort
of sensitivity analysis.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.080
For example, where you'll say
oh, a 1% change in a parameter

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.390
leads to a less than
1% change, for example.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:59.350
But in this case, there's going
to be no change, I'll tell you,

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:02.890
just so we can get the
intuition clear here.

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:05.090
All right, do you
need more time?

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:06.270
Let's go ahead and vote.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:08.728
Remember, you can vote for more
than one thing if you like.

01:03:08.728 --> 01:03:12.230
Ready, three, two, one.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:17.580
All right, some people are
using our more than one.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.300
And of course, I
can give you a hint.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.000
The reason that I'm letting
you vote more than once

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.060
is because more than one thing
is going to be-- All right,

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.380
so the majority of the group
has got this, but not everyone.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.020
So let's discuss.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.229
Can somebody give an explanation
for why both alpha and beta are

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.020
going to work here?

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.310
AUDIENCE: So the
equilibrium is basically

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:41.734
when degradation
involves production.

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:43.400
PROFESSOR: I want to
make sure I'm okay.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.160
The equilibrium is when
the production rate is

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.730
equal to the degradation rate.

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:51.230
So this is a very
important thing

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:53.010
to make sure we're on top of.

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:57.075
And in this case, we have
very sharp-- this production.

01:03:57.075 --> 01:03:57.950
So then what happens?

01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:00.116
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE]
is the intersection of--

01:04:00.116 --> 01:04:02.170
PROFESSOR: Right,
so in this case,

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:04.086
what is the equilibrium
concentration?

01:04:04.086 --> 01:04:06.030
AUDIENCE: K.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:13.900
PROFESSOR: It's equal to K.
Now, I strongly encourage you,

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.196
whenever possible,
to draw things out.

01:04:16.196 --> 01:04:18.570
Because this is a problem that
when you have the drawing.

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.944
It's reasonable to do.

01:04:19.944 --> 01:04:21.360
And if you don't
have the drawing,

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.440
you're going to get yourself
tied up into weird knots.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.140
And indeed, we can see
that if we change alpha,

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.090
what happens in this spot?

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:35.110
Right, it changes the slope.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.140
And you can see that
if we change the slope

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.920
by small amounts, we
get no change where

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.170
this crossing point is.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.532
And even for a real
system, if it came around,

01:04:44.532 --> 01:04:45.990
you'd see that it's
going to end up

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:50.230
being a less than proportional
change in the equilibrium.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:53.480
And what about what about beta?

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.020
That just raises
and lowers this.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.640
And again, that doesn't
change the equilibrium.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.110
Of course, if we changed K,
then we get a 1 to 1 change.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:07.030
So a 10% change in K leads to
a 10% change in the equilibrium

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:07.984
concentration of x.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.920
So this is the sense in which
the equilibrium concentration

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.744
in negative autoregulation is
robust to changes in both--

01:05:20.744 --> 01:05:22.660
in the book, they say
oh, the production rate,

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.118
but it's actually
also in principle

01:05:24.118 --> 01:05:27.230
the degradation rate
over some range.

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:30.390
And this could be
useful, because there

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.840
are lots of things that are
going to affect the production

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.360
rate of a protein, and
also the degradation rate,

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.730
for that matter.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.750
The division rate,
it changes it.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.100
Whereas it may be
that K is subjected

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.740
to less severe
changes, because that's

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.610
determined by, for
example, in the kinetics

01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:52.930
of binding of this
protein to this promoter.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:56.020
And that is perhaps
less subject to changes.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.450
It can still change
depending upon the pH

01:05:59.450 --> 01:06:03.440
and so forth of the
interior of the cell.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.080
But at least it's probably
not subject to the big changes

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.210
that alpha and beta are going
to be a good experience.

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:15.370
So the argument that Uri makes
for why it is we see so much

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.460
negative autoregulation in
the cell is because it both

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:24.200
increases the rate that the
cell can respond to changes,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.340
in the on direction, at
least, but also that it makes

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.420
the concentration of protein
more robust to changes

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.260
in several of the parameters
that govern the equilibrium .

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.030
Concentration And
once again, you

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:41.140
could argue about which one
of these is more important,

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:44.262
but I think they're both likely
playing a significant role

01:06:44.262 --> 01:06:45.053
in different cases.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.150
I'm going to want to move on,
but I will tell you that only

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:58.560
over some range of these
-- alpha, beta, K--

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.340
will this thing be robust.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.100
So for example, if
this comes up too high,

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.350
we're going to lose this
phenomenon of robustness.

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:13.940
So I expect you to be able
to tell me in some later date

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.880
the conditions in which
that might happen.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.516
And I'm available for
the next half hour

01:07:20.516 --> 01:07:22.890
after class, so if you do not
know what I'm talking about

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.801
right there, please
hang out with me after,

01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:27.730
and I'll tell you the solution
to that question on the exam.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:28.260
OK?

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:28.760
All right.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.870
But I do want to talk about
positive autoregulation,

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:38.710
because this is another
interesting beast.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.660
So if negative autoregulation
has those nice properties,

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.000
then you can imagine that
positive autoregulation

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.855
will have some drawbacks
in the same kind of ways.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:54.351
But it leads to some other very
interesting, just qualitative

01:07:54.351 --> 01:07:54.850
features.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.100
Positive autoregulation.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:15.440
So we have some x that
is activating itself.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.140
And often we think
about cases where

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.109
it's activating
its own expression

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:21.880
in a cooperative fashion.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.840
In particular, we
might assume that x

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.520
dot is equal to, for
example, some beta 0

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.600
plus some beta one of
some cooperative thing

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:40.149
here where N might be 2 3 4
and then again minus alpha x.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.470
Right?

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:43.080
Now, if you just
look at this, you

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.010
might think oh, I don't know
what this is going to do

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.551
and so forth.

01:08:45.551 --> 01:08:47.430
But you've got to
draw things out.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.810
Once you draw it, then
you'll see that it's

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.861
pretty straightforward.

01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:55.319
So again, this is the production
and the degradation rates.

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:05.790
So that's production.

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:08.130
And degradation, for example,
might look like this.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.350
So this is the production.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.359
This is the degradation.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.550
So that's the alpha x term.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:25.399
One question would be,
how many fixed points

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.720
does this system have?

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:35.020
So a fixed point means that
if you started right there,

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.580
and in the absence of any noise,
you would stay right there.

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.467
So it's clearly both stable
and unstable at these points.

01:09:57.818 --> 01:09:58.568
Can you read that?

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.000
I'll give you 15
seconds to count them.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.000
Ready, three, two, one.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.190
All right, it seems like we
have pretty good agreement.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:32.160
There are indeed 3 fixed points.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.670
Once again, the fixed point
is where these curves cross.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:44.560
So we have one right here,
one here, and one here,

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.170
Now, how many are stable?

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:48.660
We're going to do this verbally.

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.360
Ready, three, two, one.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:52.860
AUDIENCE: 2.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.445
PROFESSOR: 2.

01:10:53.445 --> 01:10:54.320
Let's try that again.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.113
Ready, three, two, one.

01:10:56.113 --> 01:10:56.612
AUDIENCE: 2.

01:10:56.612 --> 01:10:57.153
PROFESSOR: 2.

01:10:57.153 --> 01:11:01.940
Yeah, you get so used to the
card, it's hard to speak.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.580
So they're the ones on the
ends of the stable ones.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.754
And you see here that
around this point,

01:11:08.754 --> 01:11:11.420
the production rate over here is
more than the degradation rate.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.580
That means that if you
leave that fixed point,

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.560
you're going to get pushed away.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.290
So it's very nice to draw
these little arrows here

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:19.600
to make one happy.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.200
So this thing here is stable,
unstable, and again stable.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:35.030
Now, the reason we
call this bistability

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:38.350
is because there are
2 stable fixed points.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:43.600
This is important
because this phenomenon

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:51.830
is the basic dynamical
system's origin of memory.

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:57.330
Now it's, not obvious how
memory comes from this.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.380
So memory is a generalist idea
that the g-network or the cell

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:06.836
can retain a memory
of its past state.

01:12:06.836 --> 01:12:08.460
And we're going to
see examples of this

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.840
over the next few weeks.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.585
But just to be clear,
if, for example, we

01:12:13.585 --> 01:12:17.100
imagine a situation
where the alpha changes.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.220
And it could be division
rate, for example,

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.700
high-food, low-food
environments.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:29.520
What we do is we can
plot-- Often, you can plot,

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.194
for example, the
equilibrium, but that's

01:12:31.194 --> 01:12:32.110
a little bit trickier.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.776
So I'm just going to
plot the production

01:12:33.776 --> 01:12:39.820
rate as a function of alpha.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.010
Now, the question is,
if we change alpha,

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.089
what's going to happen?

01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:51.880
Now, for a fixed alpha,
you can see already

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.963
that there are two different
production rates that

01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:56.010
are stable in this case.

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:59.060
But what happens if
we increase alpha?

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.440
So we increase the growth
rate so it goes like this.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.890
Can that change the
number of fixed points?

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:10.700
And indeed, what we can see is
that as this line gets steeper

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.280
here, eventually you only
have a single fixed point,

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.100
and it's stable.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.475
And that's known
as a bifurcation

01:13:17.475 --> 01:13:19.860
of the dynamics of the system.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.540
So this is for large alpha, you
end up-- And just to be clear,

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.250
this is beta 0 down here.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.820
And then up here is the beta 1.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:35.050
So what we do is we
know that beta 0 is

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:38.840
where we get for large alpha.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.900
Now, for small
alpha, do we end up

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.460
getting another-- We
get another bifurcation.

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.370
So actually, there's only
again one stable point

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:52.679
up here at small alpha.

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.220
And what we're going
to get is what's

01:13:54.220 --> 01:14:00.740
known as a full
bifurcation where

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.780
solid lines denote stable
points, stable fixed points.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:08.360
Dashed lines represent
unstable fixed points.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.806
So stable, and the
dash is unstable.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.930
There are some regions
of alpha conditions

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.540
where the system is bistable.

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:27.170
But then outside of that,
it's just monostable.

01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:29.710
Can somebody explain
why this thing--

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.960
why I might make the argument
that this thing displays

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.460
memory?

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.730
Well, one of those two is
fine, but any new people

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:43.245
want to explain my
thought process?

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:46.726
No.

01:14:46.726 --> 01:14:47.600
All right, maybe you.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.840
AUDIENCE: All right,
well depending on

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.318
whether we had high
degradation or low degradation

01:14:53.318 --> 01:14:57.340
rates in the past, we'll be on
the lower or the upper range

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.520
of that if we return to normal.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.520
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.603
So the argument here is
that-- let's say that this

01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:05.740
is some normal condition.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.020
This is where you are
right now, for example.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:11.510
Now, depending upon whether
you're sitting here or here,

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.400
that's perhaps giving
some information

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.030
about the past
state of the cell.

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:19.060
Because if you were here, that
means oh, maybe in the past

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.340
you were out at high degradation
rates, whereas if you're here,

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.410
maybe were at low.

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.400
In particular, you
could reset things.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.430
If you start here, then you
can reset this memory module

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:32.846
by coming over here.

01:15:32.846 --> 01:15:34.470
Once you get to this
point here, that's

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:37.290
the bifurcation dynamics,
the full bifurcation.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:41.800
Then you come up here, and
now you'll retain this state.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.560
In principle, until
you get over here.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.893
Of course, there could be
stochastic switching dynamics.

01:15:45.893 --> 01:15:48.760
We're going to talk a lot
about that in the coming weeks.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.120
But at least in the
limit of a low rates

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.270
of stochastic
switching, then this

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:56.280
represents some sort of
memory module, the simplest

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.210
version of it.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:01.240
I'd say that in the cell, most
examples of such memory modules

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.520
involve not just
positive feedback of one

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.120
protein activating itself,
although this happens,

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.120
but often through a whole
network, where the one

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.430
protein activates another,
activates another,

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:10.420
and then you come back.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.010
Or it could be
repressing, repressing.

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:18.220
2 0's, is a po-- two
negatives is a positive.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.540
Just like two lefts is a right.

01:16:22.386 --> 01:16:23.760
Right, so are
there any questions

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.940
about the sense in
which this thing can

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.551
serve as a basic memory module?

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:31.925
And this is maybe not the most
interesting example of it,

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:33.850
because alpha is such
a global parameter.

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.900
But you can also
get similar dynamics

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.350
as a function of, for
example, the galactose

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:43.270
in the concentration of
some sugar in your media.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:47.564
So given that different small
molecules such as food sources

01:16:47.564 --> 01:16:49.230
can act as inputs
into these g-networks,

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.180
you can also get these
sorts of dynamics

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.630
as a function of what
you might call really

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:59.540
some simple, external molecule,
which is nice, because that

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.976
means that you can have
memory modules that are really

01:17:02.976 --> 01:17:04.975
independent of all the
other memory modules that

01:17:04.975 --> 01:17:06.550
are going on in your cell.

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:09.790
Whereas if you had a vary alpha,
then this changes everything.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.730
Whereas if it's just a
concentration of some sugar

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:14.610
outside, then you
can imagine that that

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:17.620
could be very useful to retain
a memory of what the cell has

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:18.620
encountered in the past.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.220
So today, what we've
been able to do

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.720
is analyze something about
a possible evolutionary

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.825
explanation for
why autoregulation

01:17:33.825 --> 01:17:36.770
is as commonly observed as is.

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.430
So negative
autoregulation is the one

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.160
that's observed perhaps
most frequently.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.190
And that, I think, has
some very clear purposes.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:46.620
And this idea of the
concentration being robust

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:51.020
to other biochemical parameters
I think is a big idea.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.543
We're going to see
this idea of robustness

01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:56.440
crop up multiple times over
the course of this semester.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.890
And I think that it's nice
to think about robustness

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:01.340
in this case, because
it's perhaps the simplest

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.660
example of how robustness
as an approach can

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:07.349
be useful as a way of
thinking about a problem.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.390
We're later going to be
thinking about robustness

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:12.780
in the context of
perfect adaptation

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.557
in chemotaxis, where
bacteria try to find food.

01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:18.390
And there, I think
everything's more subtle,

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.470
because already the base
phenomenon that is robust

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.740
is a form of robustness.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.450
And so it kind of
gets you mixed up.

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:28.310
So I think that it's good
to be very clear about what

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.477
robustness means
here, so that we

01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:32.060
can use that to think
about robustness

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.700
in other biological functions.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.520
With that, have a good weekend.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.536
Good luck on the problem set,
and I'll see you on Tuesday.

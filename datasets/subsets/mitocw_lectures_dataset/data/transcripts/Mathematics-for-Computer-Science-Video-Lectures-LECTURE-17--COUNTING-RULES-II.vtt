00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.910
PROFESSOR: We're going to talk
about inclusion-exclusion which

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.800
is a generalization
of what we did

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.250
at the end of last lecture,
which was about the sum rule.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.890
Everybody's still
talking I hear.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.290
Anyway, the inclusion-exclusion
principle is very important.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.680
And the best way to explain
this is by using Venn diagrams.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.540
So let's do this.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.890
So what did we do before?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.620
When we worked on
a sum rule, we saw

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.940
that if we count the union of
a whole collection of sets that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.170
are all disjoints, then we can
just some all the cardinalities

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.290
of each of the members.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.110
So in the case where we have
intersections-- so sets are not

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.440
disjoint-- well, if you just
count all the cardinalities--

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.500
all of the sizes of
the sets together--

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.190
you'll start to do
some double counting.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.600
So with the
inclusion-exclusion principle,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.130
we can actually exactly
compute the cardinality

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.300
of the union of sets.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.020
And you will see that
this principle can

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.010
be used in plenty of examples,
including some of them that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.050
are on the problem set.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740
So how does it work?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.950
So let's set take an example
where we just have two sets

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.050
and they have an intersection.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.550
So say this is one set which
we call M, and say here

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.450
is another set which
we call E. Well, they

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.530
have an intersection-- there's
some overlap over here.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.650
So if you would
like to write out

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.720
the different areas
over here, what

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.870
they were equal to, well, this
is everything that is in M,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.610
but we exclude what is in E.
So you write it M backslash E.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.940
This part over here
is the intersection

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.910
of-- this maybe is a little
bit too small-- so this is

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.335
the intersection of both sets.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.710
And over here we have
everything that's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.330
in E but excluding what is in
M. So if you just write out

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.960
the cardinalities of
the different sets

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.543
that we're interested
in-- so we would

00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:56.680
like to compute the cardinality
of the union of M and E.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.490
So let's have a look
how the cardinality of M

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.590
itself can be computed.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.890
Well, if you use the sum rule
which says that we can simply

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.120
add the two disjoint
sets that make up set M--

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.560
we can count each of
those cardinality--

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.510
so we have M consisting of this
part, which is M excluding E,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.550
plus the part that is right
here which is the intersection.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.900
So we use the sum
rule and conclude

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.670
that we have the sum
of everything that's

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.980
in M excluding E
plus the cardinality

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.020
of the intersection.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.560
Now, for set E we can do
something completely similar.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.920
So we will have
everything that's

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.190
in E excluding what
is in M. And then

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.540
we still have the intersection.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.810
Now we are interested in the
union of the sent M and E.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.440
And now we need to add
this one this one and this

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.220
once together.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.280
So what do we see?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.970
We see that this is
actually equal to everything

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.630
that is in M but not
in E, everything that

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.294
is in their intersection,
plus everything

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.810
that's in E but not in M.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.110
So we have these equations
that we can directly derived

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.150
from the sum rule.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.900
And, well, now we can
see here that if we

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.330
are going to simply add-- that's
what the sum rule would say--

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.340
simply add the
cardinality of M and of E,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.520
well, if we add
those two together,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.240
we will count the
intersection double.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.680
So we'll need to cancel that
because it's only counted once

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.780
in the union.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.400
So if we combine those three
over here-- those three

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:06.850
equations-- then we can conclude
that this counts the set

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.320
M intersecting with E twice.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.770
So we have that
the union is really

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.980
equal to the cardinality
of M plus that

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.280
of E minus their intersection.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.650
Now we can generalize this.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.460
And we will give
one more example

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.240
where we have three sets and it
will give the general equation.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.780
So suppose you have
three sets now.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.840
Like one, another one,
and another one over here.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.790
So we have M, E, and,
say, the set S. Well,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.880
let's have a look how many
times these different areas--

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.380
they're all disjoint--
how many times they

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:04.100
are counted when me add the
three cardinalities together.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.760
So we have M plus
the cardinality of E

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.600
plus the cardinality
of S. Well, if you

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.430
do that then we count
this area exactly

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.020
once because it's in M, this
area we count once because it's

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.360
in M and another time because
it's in E-- so it's twice--

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.820
this particular area
is only counted once

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.080
in this sum over here.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.160
And similarly, we have two
times over here, two times here,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.980
and one times over here.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.840
And this intersection
of all of the three,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.580
well, it's counted when
we count elements in M

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.445
but also when we
count elements in E

00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:43.870
and also when we
count elements in S.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.700
So this is counted three times.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.260
So let's have a look.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.460
It seems like we want to
do exactly the same as what

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.390
we did before.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.532
We like to subtract an
intersection of M and S.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:02.240
That's this part.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.440
It cancels the double
counting in this area, right?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.490
We can subtract this
intersection such that this

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.520
part is cancelled.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.340
The double counting
here is canceled.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.290
And similarly, we
want to subtract

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.750
the intersection between
E and S which would

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.300
eliminate this double counting.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.090
But now we can see that
we start to subtract

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:29.030
too much because this central
area here will be-- well,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.000
it's part of each of
those intersections

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.130
so it's actually eliminated.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.310
All of it is subtracted.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.490
So let's create
the same diagram.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.370
But now when we count the sum
of all those intersections--

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.840
so we have the
intersection of M intersect

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.450
with E, the intersection
of M with S,

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.480
and we also want to figure
out how many times elements

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:09.570
are counted in the set
E intersects with S.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.490
So let's have a look.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.830
Well, this area here
is counted zero times.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.330
It's not part of any
of these intersections

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.950
because it-- this part is
only in M and not in S or E.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.020
So this is counted zero times.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.530
And here we have the same.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.530
Well, this part over
here is exactly once

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.980
in this intersection
between those two sets.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.710
It's not in this one so
this is counted once.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.030
So we have by symmetry
that for all the others.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.809
This area, however, is in both
this intersection as well as

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.200
this one and also this one.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.270
So it's counted three times.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.540
So now we can easily start to
combine all these together.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.490
And you can see, if we take
this sum and we subtract this,

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.020
then the middle
area is cancelled.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.180
So we have to still add the
intersection of the three sets.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.030
The intersection of
M, E and S together.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:11.060
So in a formula that
would look like this.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.040
So we are interested
in the union.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.540
And this can now be
written as, well,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.000
the sum of the cardinalities
of the individual sets.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.830
And we subtract
the intersections

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.160
that we have up there.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.743
So M intersect E
minus M intersect

00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:44.780
with S and minus E
intersect with S.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.256
Now we have eliminated-- if
you look at this Venn diagram

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:49.755
over here-- this
diagram over here--

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:52.950
we've eliminated everything
that's in the middle area.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.130
So we still need to add
intersection-- everything that

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:02.220
is counted in the intersection
of M, E, as well as S.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.940
So we have this equation.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.390
And now you can see why we call
this the inclusion-exclusion

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.700
principle.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.510
Here we include all the
elements in M, E and S.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.800
Now we have to exclude
what we counted too much.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.310
So we have exclusion over here.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.830
And now we, again, have
to include some stuff

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.080
because we excluded too much.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.430
And then we keep
on going like this.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:39.420
So, in general, we get
the following theorem

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.640
that says that, if you
look at the cardinalities--

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.770
of the cardinality of the union
of a whole bunch of sets--

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.490
say we have n sets-- then this
is actually equal to-- well,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.900
we first include the sums of all
the individual cardinalities.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:08.960
Which is from I equals 1 to n
cardinality of Ai minus-- now

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.270
we have to, again,
we have to eliminate

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.820
all the double counting-- so
we look at every pair of sets

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.580
indexed by i1 and i2.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.690
And we look at
their intersection

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.320
and we take that out
using this minus sign.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.430
We exclude this.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.350
And we continue like this.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.250
So we add now-- because
we have excluded too much,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.850
we have to include
some more-- we

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.860
look at all triples of sets
indexed by i1, i2-- oops--

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.650
and i3.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.110
And now we look at the
intersection of those sets.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.030
And we continue like
this all the way

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:09.170
until we look at the very last
intersection that you can have,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.830
which is intersection
of all the sets.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.790
And it depends on whether
n is even or add whether we

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.040
have to include or exclude it.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.520
So we have a minus 1
to the power n plus 1.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.950
And then we have the
intersection of all of these.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.900
Now, we can write this out
in a more elegant formula

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.690
where we just put all this
what I wrote here in a sum.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.010
And then it looks like this.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:47.310
It's the sum over k
equals 1 to n minus 1

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.460
to the power k plus 1.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.540
So depends whether
k is even or odd

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.570
whether we do an inclusion
or an exclusion in this sum.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:03.870
And we look at all the subsets
that our subsets of the index

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:11.220
set 1 up to n such that the
cardinality of the set S

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.440
is equal to k.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.430
And now we need to look at
the cardinality of all--

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.880
of the intersection of all the
sets that are indexed by S.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:31.265
So that's-- so I run-- I put i--
so do the intersection of all i

00:13:31.265 --> 00:13:34.630
in S of the sets Ai.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.430
So this general formula is the
inclusion-exclusion principle.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.930
And this is the way
how we can think

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.980
about it how to derive it.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.140
Of course, this is not a proof.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.250
But you could do this
yourself by using induction.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.700
And you can use induction on n.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.250
So that's a pretty
straightforward exercise.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.750
OK.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.385
So let's give an example.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.630
Let's do that over here.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.480
You will have a problem that's
similar on the problem set.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.540
And it's goes like this.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.540
You would like to know how
many permutations are there

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.740
with a special property.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:31.930
So how many permutations
do I have of the set 0,

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.420
1 all the way up to 9.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.120
So all the digits.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:47.140
And that have consecutive--
so I put this in brackets just

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.945
to clarify-- so consecutive
either a 4 and a 2 right next

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:52.570
to one another.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.940
So remember, a permutation
is a sequence that has each

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.900
of those digits exactly once.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.420
And I like to count
those permutations that

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.980
have a 4 and a 2 next to
one another in this way.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.270
So we have 4, 2.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:16.800
Or the permutation may
have a 0, 4 or a 6, 0.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.725
So I'm very curious, how
many permutations do I have?

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:21.810
And I'm going to use this
principle that I just

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.310
described.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.970
So how do we need to
go ahead with this?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.960
Well, this-- so I'm interested
in the permutations that have

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.110
a 4 and 2 next to one another.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.770
So that could be my
first set, say, M.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.611
And then I have
a set that I want

00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.860
to count that has the 0 and
the 4 next to one another.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.920
That could be my
E. And the S could

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.210
be those permutations that
have the 6 and a 0 next to one

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:48.830
another.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.480
So then I would like to
use that rule over here.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.130
So I would also need to count
all the intersections and so

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.630
on.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.010
So let's do this.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.780
Let me first give an example
of such a permutation.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.250
So for example, I could
have the permutation

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:13.570
that is the sequence 7,
2, 5, 6, 0, and the 4,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.420
for example, 3, 5, 1 and 9.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.720
So I have all the digits
that are in the-- contained

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.680
in the set.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.940
And I see that, actually,
this particular permutation

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.760
has a 6 and a 0
next to one another.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.900
So it's in this particular--
the set of permutations

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.460
that have a 6 and a 0.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.710
I can also see it
has a 0 and a 4.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.000
So it's also in the set of
permutations that have a 0

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.560
and a 4 next to one another.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.060
OK.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.260
So now I'm going to define
these different sets

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.530
and then we're going to
start counting these.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.450
And this is the type
of counting that you're

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.740
doing in this problem set.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.210
And the intuition
that you create

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.390
by doing that you
can use later on when

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.740
we study probability theory.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.890
OK.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:19.760
So let's define the set P4,
2 as all the permutations

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:27.980
that have-- so it's the set
of permutations with 4, 2.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.380
And similarly, we have P0, 4
which is the same thing but now

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.320
with 0, 4.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.680
P6, 0, the set of full
permutations with 6, 0.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.030
So let's have a look at what
the sizes of an individual

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.900
set of permutations.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.310
How can we do this?

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:58.270
So let's have a look at the
size of, say, this one, P60.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.410
Well, what kind of trick can
I do in order to count this?

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:07.520
So we have learned a
few rules last time.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.565
And what I would like
to do is, well, this

00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:12.460
is a slightly more
complex structure,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.330
so I would like to
map this to a set

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.710
by means of a bijection
That will be great.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.480
Then to do some
kind of other sets

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.520
that is easy to count for me.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.480
So then, by the
bijection rule, I

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.100
will be able to figure out what
the cardinalities of this set.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.060
So the trick here is to
find such a bijection.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.380
And the idea is that you could
actually treat the 6 and the 0

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.540
as one unique symbol.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.350
So let's see how it works.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.710
So what I could do is I
can have, from the set

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.860
of-- from P60-- so all
the permutations that

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.450
have 6 and a 0 next
to one another-- I

00:18:52.450 --> 00:19:03.390
can find a bijection to the
permutations of the set that

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.371
have 6, 0 as a single symbol.

00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:09.870
And then I have all the other
symbols, all the other digits.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:19.400
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 0.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.776
So let's have an example of--
we have one up here, actually.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.240
So how would I map this?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.250
This would be mapped
according to that definition.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.370
To 7, 2, 5.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:45.380
And now I combine 6 and 0 into
one symbol in my sequence.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.580
And then I have the rest.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.890
4, 3, 5, 1, and 9.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.760
Now this is easy for
me to count, right?

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.690
So this is a bijection.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.180
And by the bijection rule,
the cardinality of this set

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.270
is equal to the total number
of permutations on this set.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.690
Now, this set has
exactly eight elements

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.820
so I know how many there are.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.740
So I know that the cardinality
is equal to 8 factorial.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.370
Because there are 8 factorial
permutations on sets of size 8.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.560
We saw that last time.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.430
So that's the trick or--

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.070
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.153
PROFESSOR: Oh, is it nine?

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:33.210
Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.440
Great.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.220
So this is 9.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.940
And similarly, in the same way,
we can also count these, right?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.700
We can treat 0, 4 as one
symbol or 4, 2 as one symbol.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.390
So I also know that the
cardinalities of these

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:55.435
are also equal to 9 factorial.

00:20:55.435 --> 00:20:57.560
Now, when I use the
inclusion-exclusion principle--

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.190
so now I've computed
those three,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.240
essentially-- I need to
subtract their intersections.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.340
So let's compute
the intersections.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:17.090
And if you do that, we're going
to use the exact same trick.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.580
So we're going to find the
bijection to permutations

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.640
of a set of symbols.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.280
And we just have
to specify those.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.470
So let's do this together
and take, for example,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:41.130
the intersection
of P42 with P60.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.450
So what kind of a
bijection could I have?

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:50.770
So it will be all-- to
all the permutations

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.860
on what kind of a set?

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.680
So I use the exact
same trick here.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.400
So I'm going to treat 4 and 2
as one symbol and 6, 0 as one

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.700
symbol.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.630
So I have 4, 2, 6, 0 and
then all the other digits.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:14.410
So it's the 1, 3,
5, 7, 8, and 9.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.650
You can count that
this number is 8.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.990
So by the bijection
rule, we have

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.880
that the cardinality
of this intersection

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.810
is equal to 8 factorial.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.830
And we continue
like this to compute

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.480
all the other intersections.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.780
And they do look a little
bit different sometimes.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:40.580
So for example, if I
have 6, 0 and P 0, 4--

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:48.110
so let me define the permutation
first-- or the bijection first.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.899
So how do we do this one?

00:22:50.899 --> 00:22:51.565
Any suggestions?

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.860
So what kind of a set can
I find a permutation to?

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:04.130
If I look-- so over here I have
a permutation in which 6 and 0

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.520
are next to one another.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.550
But this is also a
permutation in which 0 and 4

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.790
are next to one another.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.699
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:12.699 --> 00:23:13.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.900
So 3, 6, 0 and 4 is one
symbol because permutation

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.740
is right in here has a 6
and 0 next to one another.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.950
And the 0 should also be next to
the 4 because it's in this set

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.180
as well.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.930
So we know that every
permutation in here

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:34.250
has a sub sequence of 6,
0, 4 next to one another.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.680
So we can treat
this as one symbol.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.180
And then we have
all the other ones.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.520
And again, this is--
these are 8 elements.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.330
So we have that also,
for this intersection,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.340
the cardinality is equal,
by the bijection rule,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.460
as the total number
of permutations

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.375
on a set of eight elements,
which is 8 factorial.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:15.930
So for the last one, we
also have similar-- so

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.680
let me see which
one I need to do.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:23.460
So I have 4, 2 and 0, 4.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.900
Well, again, I do
the same trick.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.820
Now I have a symbol that has--
well, the permutation here

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.280
has a 0 and a 4
next to one another,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.530
and the 4 is next to a 2.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.780
So I treat this as one symbol.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:45.260
So if the permutations on
the set 0, 4, 2, and then

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:52.450
1, 3, 5, 7-- oh, and 6
as well-- 8 and nine.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:59.235
So the cardinality of this set
is also equal to 8 factorial.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.410
So now we still have to look
at the intersection of all

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.480
of those three in order to
use the inclusion-exclusion

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.140
principle.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.640
And, well, the same trick
can be used over here.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.980
So we look at the
intersection of P60 with P04

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.400
and the permutations that have
4 and 2 next to one another.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.467
So what does that mean?

00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:30.300
It means that the
permutation that's in here

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.260
has a 6, 0 and then
a 4 and then a 2.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.190
So these are all the
permutations with a 6, 0, 4,

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.160
2 next to one another.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.630
And this can map
easily to the sets

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.040
where we treat this
as one symbol-- 6042--

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.470
and then we have 1,
3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.720
This set has seven elements, so
the intersection of these three

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.630
is equal to 7 factorial.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.540
And now we can use the
inclusion-exclusion principle

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.450
using this over here.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.600
And when we plug
everything in here,

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.750
we can see that the
intersection-- that the union--

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:27.850
when we count the union of P60
which P04 and P42 is actually

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.480
equal to 9 factorial for
these, 8 factorials for those,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.930
and a 7 factorial for these.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:39.990
So it's 3 times 9 factorial
minus 3 times 8 factorial

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.962
plus 1 times a 7 factorial.

00:26:43.962 --> 00:26:46.295
So this is how we can use
inclusion-exclusion principle.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.140
So this generalized
the sum rule.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.220
And now we have a
whole set of rules

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.819
already discussed
since last time.

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.360
We continue with
the bookkeeper rule.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.340
You have already seen
it during recitation

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.990
so I will only write
it out once more.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.570
And all these rules
together we will then

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.670
use in a set of examples.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.060
So what was the bookkeeper rule?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:34.600
We have that-- so the
bookkeeper rule is,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:41.050
if I have distinct copies of
letters-- so distinct copies

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:56.170
of letters l1, l2,
l3 and lk, well, then

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.830
the number of
sequences that have

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.010
exactly n1 letters
of the type l1

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.610
and n2 letters of the type
l2 and so on, well, we

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.120
can count those.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:24.080
So sequences with n1 copies
of l1 and n2 copies of l2,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:32.200
and then we continue like this
until we have nk copies of lk.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.800
Well, we can count this.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.840
So these copies can
be in an arbitrary

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.480
order in the sequence.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.140
And we saw in recitation that
this can be written as n plus 1

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:50.350
plus n2 all the way
up to nk factorial.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:55.440
And we divide out the product
that starts with n1 factorial

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:02.040
times n2 factorial
up to nk factorial.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.470
And this we also can
write as what-- well,

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.440
this is actually the
definition of what we call

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.900
the multinomial coefficient.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.740
So you've already seen the
binomial coefficients, which

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.530
is a special case of this one.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:23.030
So we write this as
n1 plus up to nk.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.190
And then we have
n1, n2, and we just

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.770
repeat all of those in here.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:38.800
If we have k equals 2, then we
get the binomial coefficient.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.310
And if k equals this 2,
we also often just forget

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.060
about the last term.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.930
So we would get
expressions that look

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:54.390
like this, which is really
equal to nk comma n minus k.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:54.890
OK.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.220
So this is some-- these
are some definitions.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.660
And we can apply
this bookkeeper rule.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.800
For example, last time in the
lecture we were talking about

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.000
the number of bit sequences
of length 16 with four 1's.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.740
We wanted to count this because
we found out that if you want

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:25.660
to select 12 donuts
of five varieties,

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.270
we can find a mapping of
bijection towards this set

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.380
of bit sequences with
12 0's and four 1's.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:39.870
So the bookkeeper rule will tell
us exactly how many there are.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:44.650
And that's the most basic
example, essentially,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.300
of this way of counting.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.500
So what do we have?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:31:04.890
So the number of bit sequences
of length 16 and with four

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.160
1's-- well, is exactly equal
to, according to this rule,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:15.440
as length 16 and we need to
choose four 1's out of these

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.990
16.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.180
And it's the
binomial coefficients

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:26.250
where we choose four
out of the 16 symbols.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.180
And this is equal to 16
factorial divided by 4

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.110
factorial times 12 factorial.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:43.730
Now we often also denote
the following rule--

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.310
we sort of identify
as a special case.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:53.740
We say that the number of
k elements-- of k element

00:31:53.740 --> 00:32:06.420
subsets-- of an n element set
is actually equal to n choose k.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.120
So this is an important
rule to remember

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.615
which will occur many times.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.780
OK.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.590
A theorem that we can have
derived from all this stuff

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.510
is what we call the
binomial theorem.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.020
So we'll quickly go over that.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:41.580
The binomial theorem says
that, for all integers n--

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.840
positive integers n-- we have
a plus b to the power n equals

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.320
to the sum where we
take k from 0 to n

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.250
and then we have the
binomial where we

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.900
have this expression over here.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:06.840
We choose k out of n
and we choose, say, k

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.982
times b in this expression.

00:33:08.982 --> 00:33:10.690
I will explain in a
moment by an example.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.630
And n minus k ace.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.170
And this is the theorem.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.300
And I will just
give an example just

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:22.300
to show how we can
think about this.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.510
So let me do that over here.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:31.595
So if you take n
equals to 2, then we

00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:34.830
can see that we get all the
combinations, essentially,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.380
of a and b of length 2.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:42.420
So you have a times a, a times
b, b times a, and b times b.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.300
So what do we see?

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.470
We see a squared plus ab
plus ba plus b squared.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.980
Now we see that these have 1
times an a and 1 times a b.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.660
This one has 2 times an a
and this one has 2 times a b.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.449
And this combines together
as a squared plus 2 times

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:11.340
ab plus b squared.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.179
Now, if you have n equals 3--
so we have a plus b to the power

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:22.100
3-- you will get all
the different products,

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.889
all the different terms,
that add up to this,

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.940
are all the kinds of
combinations of a's and b's.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:36.880
So for example, we have three
a's-- so 3 times a-- but it can

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:47.739
also have a squared times b
plus aba plus b a squared.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:53.840
And those have exactly two
times an a and one times a b.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.650
I can now look at
all the others--

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.600
so I may have two times
the b and one times the a.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.570
So what our those?

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:11.570
We have a times b squared
plus bab plus b squared a.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.550
So I count these
as the same, right?

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.340
They each have the
same number of b's.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.510
Two times the b and
one times the a.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:27.110
And then, finally, I
have b to the power 3

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.120
which counts three times the b.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.120
So these are all the
possible terms that I have.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.510
There are eight in total.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.436
One, two, three, four,
five, up to eight.

00:35:35.436 --> 00:35:36.310
And that fits, right?

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.877
Because I can have a
choice of an a and a b.

00:35:39.877 --> 00:35:40.960
And I do that three times.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.440
So 2 times 2 times
2 is equal to 8.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.090
So I have eight terms.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:50.170
And I can group them together
by taking a to the power 3

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:57.080
plus 3 times a squared
b plus 3 times-- and now

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:04.830
I have b squared a-- and
finally, b to the power 3.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.980
So what do we see here?

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.860
How many terms are their
that have exactly two times

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.630
an a and one times a b?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:17.370
Well, it's like we have a
set of three elements, right?

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.470
Or three positions.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.250
And I like two of
them to be an a.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.580
So I choose two out of
those three to be an a.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:30.870
So I use this subset rule
to count how many times I

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:35.270
see the same term back.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:42.650
So let's write this
out so that is-- so

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:50.960
the number of terms
that have k times an a,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.120
and we have, say, n
minus k times a b.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.680
So how many terms do I have?

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:09.700
Well, that is the length
of-- so the number of-- oops.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.280
Change that.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.320
So it's the number
of length n sequences

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.350
that have the
following property.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:27.220
That these have k a's
and n minus k b's.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.390
And that's easy to count.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.120
Which is equal to what
we have done here before.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.700
We have the binomial n choose k.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.130
And that, if you plug
that in over here,

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:42.400
then we get this particular sum.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.980
So it is-- this is
the binomial theorem.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.910
Very famous.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.960
And now we're going
to use all this stuff

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.660
to count some poker hands.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.440
So we have come to this
part of the lecture.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.740
So we're going to do
a bunch of examples

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.830
that are similar
to some of those

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:01.460
that you will see
in the problem set.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.145
And then at the end
we go and continue

00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:07.190
with some-- with a
different proof technique.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:16.260
So let's first define
a deck of cards

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.870
because that's what we
are going to use now.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:26.430
So for this type of
problems, we will

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:34.810
use a deck which is
actually a set of 52 cards.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:44.490
And a card itself
actually has a suit.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:47.140
And the suit can
be something that

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.170
looks like this, which
is called spades.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.970
S of spades.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:58.500
We have another symbol
which is this, hearts.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:06.670
And we will have clubs
and we have diamonds.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.970
And besides a suit, a
card also has a value.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:21.030
And the values are arranged from
2, 3, 4, all the way up to 10.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.440
Then we have a special
symbol-- special value--

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.600
which is called the Jack.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.030
We've got a Queen and a
King and finally the Ace.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.930
And in total, we have
13 possible values.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.930
So you can see that
we have four times,

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.900
because of four different
suits, 4 times 13

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.330
is 52 different cards
and that makes up a deck.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.450
So we're going to look at hands.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:55.605
And a hand is actually
a collection-- a set

00:39:55.605 --> 00:39:57.720
of five cards.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.560
So it's a subset of
the deck of five cards.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.310
And we do not worry
about the order

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.290
of the cards in your hand.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.210
They can be permuted,
if you want.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.480
So the order's not important.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.750
So it's a subset of five cards.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.460
So how many hands do I have?

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.550
Well, how many ways
are there to choose

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:31.740
a subset of five cards
out of a deck of 52 cards?

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.900
Well, we can use
a subset through

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.670
and we get the
binomial 52 choose 5.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.900
Which is, by the way, a lot so
let me write it out as well.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.710
It's about 2 and 1/2 million.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.280
So we are interested
in, when we play poker--

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.450
if you do that-- in
really good hands.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.920
So we like four of
a kind, which means

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.420
that we have four cards that
actually have the same value.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.160
Or we have cards
that-- hands that have

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.270
what we call a full house.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.120
We will count those in a moment.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.240
Or other kinds of combinations.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:26.170
And the rarer the combination
is in your hand, the higher

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.820
or the better your hand
is, and the more likely

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.080
it is that you win
the poker game.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.550
If you do not get left out.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.050
All right.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.030
So let's give an example
of a four of a kind.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.840
So we're going to
compute those and we

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.350
will see that we need to do--
to use all the-- a combination

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.183
for all these rules.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.600
OK.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:11.180
So four of a kind
is the special hand

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:19.245
where we have four
of one kind of value.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.200
Notice, by the way, that the
fifth card, because of this,

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.440
must have a different
value, right?

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.780
Because there are
only four cards

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.090
that have, say, the value eight.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.030
Because there are only
four different suits.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.540
So the fifth card
will ultimately

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.650
have a different value.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:49.310
So as an example, we will have
the 8 of spades and then the 9

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.930
of diamonds and all the
other 8's-- the 8 of diamonds

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.930
and the 8 of hearts and,
say, the 8 of clubs.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.820
And how do we count
these types of hands?

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.620
We're going to look
for a representation

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.070
of how can you represent
such hands, such objects?

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.120
So we have to count a
special type of object,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.310
a special kind of poker hand.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.800
And in order to do
that, we're going

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.190
to look for a way to
represent these objects

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:24.450
and in such a way that we
can count them very easily.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.530
And that's really
the trick in order

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.500
to solve these kinds
of counting problems.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.680
So the representation
that we have here is--

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.420
well, we can choose--
first of all,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:46.430
we can choose the value of the
four kinds-- of the four cards.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.970
So how many choices do I have?

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.820
Well, I got any choice.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.990
There are 13 different
values so I have 13 choices.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.260
So that's easy.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:06.510
Secondly, I can choose the
value of the extra card.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.310
So how many choices
do I have here?

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:18.450
Well, the four of a kind already
eliminates one kind of value

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.100
completely.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:19.600
Right?

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.020
So I have any of the
other values is possible.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.370
Is equally likely, even.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.670
So I have 12 choices.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:35.870
And, lastly, I can represent--
I need to still represent

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.280
the suit of the extra card.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.279
So I also want to know the
suit of the extra card.

00:44:43.279 --> 00:44:44.570
And how many choices do I have?

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.080
Well, I can choose
any of those four.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.970
So that's four.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.110
So, essentially, what
we constructed here

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:57.830
is a mapping by using
this representation.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:03.510
And the mapping tells
us-- is as follows.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.292
Let's keep this up.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:21.390
So the mapping goes from poker
hands-- from card-- from hands

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:27.940
to-- from hands with four of
a kind to this representation.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.480
So let's write it out.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.960
So we have four of a kind.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.080
And then we have a
function-- a mapping

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.240
f-- that goes to
this representation.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.020
We will have the first
entry-- the value 1

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.795
and the value 2
and then a value 3.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:54.780
So for example, if you
take this hands of cards,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:01.820
well, the first one, we see that
the four of a kind has value 8.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.860
The value of the second card is
the 9 of the 9 diamonds cards.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.520
So we have 9.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.580
And finally, the suit
that I need to select for,

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.910
the extra card is diamonds.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.031
So this is an example.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.940
And now we know, because
this is a bijection,

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.030
we know that the number of
hands with four of a kind

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:29.340
is equal to all these
types of sequences,

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.780
all these types of
sequences that can--

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.860
that are chosen according
to this representation.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.970
Well, we have 13 choices
for the first value.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.060
And given this first
value, we have 12 choices

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.750
for the second value.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:53.840
And given those two, I have four
choices for the very last entry

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.870
in this sequence.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.100
So this is the generalized
product rule that I'm using.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:05.950
So we see that the number of
sequences is equal to 13 times

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.170
12 times 4.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.650
Turns out this is equal to 624.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:15.250
Well, if you divide it
over total number of cards.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.476
So how did we do this?

00:47:16.476 --> 00:47:18.017
This is the generalized
product rule.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.560
If you divide this number
of the total number of cards

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.030
we could get the fraction
of one over about 4,000.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.045
So it's really rare that
you get four of a kind.

00:47:30.045 --> 00:47:33.321
So it's a really good hand.

00:47:33.321 --> 00:47:33.820
OK.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.280
Let's do a few more of these.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.520
We also like to know how
many full houses there are.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.270
A full house is a special hand.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:54.740
It has three cards of one value
and two cards of another value.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.290
So how many are there?

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:15.115
So again, we are going to
use the exact same principle.

00:48:15.115 --> 00:48:17.850
We're going to find
a representation

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.020
of this type of hand.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:30.340
So we have three cards of one
value and two cards of another.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:42.990
So for example, we may have
the hands that contain,

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:46.060
say, three cards with value 2.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.970
A 2 clubs, a 2 spades,
and also a 2 diamonds.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:55.520
And, say, a Jack club
and a Jack of diamonds.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.330
And another example could be,
say, a 5 of diamonds and a 5

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:10.000
of hearts, 5 of clubs, 7 of
hearts, and also a 7 of club.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.390
So now you can see that it's
very easy to represent this.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.890
Right?

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.020
We can start grouping
things together.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.330
We can say, represent
this by first

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:27.810
taking the value of the
three cards that I have here.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.630
So it's 2.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.330
Then I want to indicate in a
second term in my sequence--

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:37.910
in my representation-- which
suits did I use over here?

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.490
Well, I used clubs,
spades and diamonds.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:46.560
So it's a set club,
spades and diamonds.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.180
And now I also have a pair.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.550
Like, two cards
with the same value.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:52.960
What's the value?

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.990
It's Jack.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:57.630
And what are the suits
associated to these?

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.870
Well, clubs and the diamonds.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.964
So I have not yet for-- given
you the formal definition

00:50:04.964 --> 00:50:06.380
of the representation,
but you can

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.440
see that you could do
something like this.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.100
So this is often how we start
out on a piece of paper.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:17.390
You try to do something
and hopefully it works.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:21.200
So we have-- here we have
diamonds, hearts, and clubs.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:28.160
And then we have--
finally we have two cards

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.150
with the same value 7.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:34.090
And they have the hearts
and clubs as suits.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.170
OK.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:48.310
So the representation
is defined as follows.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:59.830
It just started out with a first
entry in my representation.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:03.250
And this is going to be
the value of the triple.

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:08.980
So how many choices do
we have for this value?

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.330
Well, I can choose any of
the 13 possible values.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.890
So I have 13 choices.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:23.220
And the second part is
the suits of the triple.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:28.450
Well, I have to choose
a subset of the four

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.300
possible suits of size three.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.870
So I need to have a subset
of size three out of the four

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.690
possible suits.

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:38.830
And that will give me the
proper representation.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.320
So how many choices do I
have for such a subset?

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.190
Well, there's three
elements out of four.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.840
So we can use the subset
rule and see that this has

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.675
4 choose 3 equals four choices.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.560
Then the last part is
to value of the pair

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.230
that I have of the two cards
that are having the same value.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.920
Now, how many choices
do I have here?

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.160
Well, I have to be a
little bit careful, though.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.360
I just want to make sure that
I do the right reasoning here.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.890
I know that there's still--
because I chose a triple

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.310
of cards of the same
value-- for example,

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.600
over here I chose all these
2's-- but I still have one card

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.120
in my deck which has a 2.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.400
Actually, here I've chosen
clubs, spades and diamonds.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.910
So the one that is missing
is the 2 of hearts.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.910
So I could possibly
choose the 2 of hearts.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:43.710
But wait a minute.

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:47.306
If I choose the 2 of hearts,
how can I make a pair?

00:52:47.306 --> 00:52:48.430
That's not possible, right?

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.970
Because I've already
chosen all the other 2's

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:55.440
so there's no other 2
to match to find a pair.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:01.360
So I actually cannot choose this
particular value of this triple

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.640
for the pair.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.970
But all the other
values are possible.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.450
So I have 12 choices.

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:12.960
One less than the one that I've
already chosen for the triple.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:21.370
Now, and then similarly, I
can choose suits of the pair.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.810
And how many choices do I have?

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:27.230
Well, look at every
possible subset

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:31.230
that I can have of size
two out of the four suits.

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:35.160
So I use the subset rule
and find that this is 4

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.780
choose 2 which is equal to 6.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.180
So now we're going to multiply
all of these together.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.030
We use the generalized
product rule again.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:52.640
So we have found a mapping
from hands with a full house

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.070
to these types of
representations--

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.040
to this representation.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.450
And this mapping is bijective.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.210
So the number of full house
is exactly equal to the number

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:06.940
of these representations.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.530
And by the generalized
product rule,

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:12.210
I can choose the first entry
of such a sequence in 13 ways.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.960
The second one, given the
first one, in four ways.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.400
This one I can choose
in 12 ways given I've

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.760
already chosen my triple.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.730
And so on.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.580
So by the generalized
product rule,

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.290
I know now that the
product of those four

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:30.740
is equal to the total
number of full house hands.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.940
So how much is that?

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:39.710
It's 13 times 4 choose 3
times 12 times 4 choose 2.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:44.910
And this turns out
to be equal to 3,744.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.410
Which is a factor six bigger
than a four of a kind.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.060
So it's much more likely
that you get one of those.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.790
And that's the reason
why four of a kind

00:54:53.790 --> 00:55:01.410
has more worth-- is worth
much more than a full house.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:06.670
So let's do another example,
a hand with two pairs,

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.190
and see whether we can continue
this type of reasoning.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:11.010
It's going pretty well.

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:15.626
And maybe we can
do the same thing.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:24.190
We'll see that, in
counting, you really

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.260
have to take a lot of care.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.630
So maybe you can
already see what's

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:32.300
happening when I start reasoning
in the exact same way as

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.130
before.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.950
So let me first define
what I want to count.

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:43.750
It's a hand that have
exactly two pairs.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.850
So what does that mean?

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:53.680
It means that there is-- that
we have two cards of one value

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.870
and another two cards
of another value.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:12.190
So let's start out as before.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.820
We're going to write
out a representation

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.660
and see whether we
can do this properly.

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:25.470
So we're going to use
the exact same technique.

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:28.150
So first of all,
we're going to choose

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.380
the value of the first pair.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.580
Now, how many ways
can I do this?

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.770
Well, I can do this in 13 ways.

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.350
Any possible value is possible.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.810
I need to choose the
suits of the first pair.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.740
And how many ways can I do this?

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.670
Well, I use the same
techniques as over here,

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:04.500
so it's any possible way
to choose two elements out

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.260
of a set of four which
represent all the suits.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.300
So that's 4 choose 2.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.350
Then, three, we're
going to choose

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.520
the value of the second pair.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.600
Well, that's easy because the
second pair, by definition,

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.050
must have a different value
than the one in the first pair.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.330
Well, I've already
chosen one value

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.780
so I have 12 choices left.

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.518
So that's no problem.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.430
And now we can continue
and do the same thing.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.850
So we're going to count the
number of suites that are

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:58.420
possible for the second pair.

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:06.870
And it's the same number as
we have for the first pair.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:10.820
So we have a number of
suits of the second pair.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.490
Again, we need to
choose two suits out

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:18.470
of the complete set of suits,
which has four possibilities.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.790
So it's 4 choose 2.

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:25.870
And now we can have still a
choice for the last cards.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:27.510
We have now two pairs.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:29.220
We still have a fifth card.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.230
The fifth card also has a value.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.560
Actually, I did
not write it down,

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.660
but if we talk about
a hand with two pairs,

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:42.640
we mean two cards of one value,
two cards of another value,

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:47.000
and the fifth card-- the extra
card-- has yet another value.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.370
Because otherwise you
would have a full house

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.610
and we have already
counted those.

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:53.110
OK.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:58.140
So value of the extra card.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.230
Well, I've chosen
already two values.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:03.110
The one for the first pair,
the one of the second pair,

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:05.830
so there are 11 choices left.

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:10.390
And finally, I can choose
a suit of the extra card.

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:16.320
Well, I have one out of
four choices for my suit.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.900
So again we can use the
generalized product rule

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:26.690
and we can say that we have
30 choices for my first entry

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:28.500
in my presentation.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.000
Right?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.980
For the first choice.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.970
Then given the first
choice, I have 4 choose

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.190
2 choices for the second.

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.936
And then 12 choices
for the third

00:59:39.936 --> 00:59:41.580
if I've already
chosen the first two.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.750
And so on.

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:47.090
So I can use the
generalized product rule

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:50.520
and count these representations.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.980
So the number of
representations is actually

00:59:54.980 --> 01:00:01.720
equal to 13 times 4
choose 2 times 12 times

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:07.241
4 choose 2 again times
11 times 4 choose 1.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:15.230
So is this a number of
the hands with two pairs?

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.930
So this seems to be
pretty reasonable.

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:23.780
But can you see something that
has happened here that we also

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.290
saw actually last lecture?

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.520
Like, do I know for sure
that the hands with two pairs

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.820
is-- well, that are this
number of hands with two pairs.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.100
What do I need to check in order
to make sure that that is true?

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.800
Well, I need to make-- I
need to prove, essentially,

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.690
that this representation
is actually

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:52.340
bijection from the
hands with two pairs

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.470
to this types of sequences.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.740
So is that true?

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.495
Or does this mapping have
a different property?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.988
Any ideas?

01:01:06.988 --> 01:01:07.488
Yeah?

01:01:07.488 --> 01:01:09.396
Over there.

01:01:09.396 --> 01:01:10.247
AUDIENCE: No.

01:01:10.247 --> 01:01:10.830
PROFESSOR: No?

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.505
You don't want to answer?

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:13.990
OK.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:22.270
Well, let me-- when we talked
about the chess game last time,

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:25.620
or with the rooks,
we could essentially

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.800
had two rooks that we
could choose and put them

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.950
on different positions with no
shared rows or shared columns.

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:39.780
And here we have two pairs with
no shared suit-- with no shared

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.080
values.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.640
But what can we do?

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.850
We can actually interchange
the first and the second pair.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:54.340
So as an example, we can
have two representations

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.730
that map to the same hand.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:56.880
So let me give an example.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.300
So for example, suppose
you choose the value

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.810
3 for the first
pair and then I'm

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:08.730
choosing the set diamonds and
clubs for the suits of those.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:15.020
And say the second pair is a
queen of diamonds and hearts.

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.370
And finally, I have
an ace of clubs.

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:22.090
Well, this would be a
proper sequence according

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:24.070
to this representation.

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:26.210
But this maps to a
hand that does also

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:30.540
map to if we interchange the
first and the second pair.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:36.020
We can also start off with
the queen for the first pair

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.500
and we have diamonds and hearts.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:44.515
And we have three for the second
pair with diamonds and clubs.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.110
And then we finally have
the fifth card which

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.820
is the same, the ace of clubs.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:57.730
Now these map to
exactly the same hand.

01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.495
We just need to change the
first and the second pair.

01:03:00.495 --> 01:03:10.020
Now this is a kind of problem
or a mental sort of confusion

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.760
that very easily happened.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.920
This is a rather easy
example where you can see it.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.860
But if you do
counting, we really

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.660
have to take care that
we make sure that each

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.920
of the sequences in
this representation

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.450
are really represented by,
say, one hand, in this case,

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.000
with two pairs.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.430
But how can we remedy this?

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:42.570
It turns that we can-- by
interchanging these two pairs,

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:46.000
these two sequences are
the only two sequences

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.990
that map to the same hand.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.200
So we know that this
is not a bijection

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.090
but it is a 2-to-1 mapping.

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:59.590
So now we can choose-- we
can use the division rule.

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:06.220
And by the division
rule we now know

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:14.530
that the number of
hands with two pairs

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:20.070
is actually equal to this whole
thing over here divided by 2

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.448
because we have a
2-to-1 function.

01:04:23.448 --> 01:04:25.810
Now, this is really
something that

01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:27.310
is pretty disturbing
because we have

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.340
a near miss in our reasoning.

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.510
And therefore, it
is important to keep

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:38.250
in mind the following
guidelines when we do counting.

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:47.230
It's very important
to, first of all, check

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.060
whether it's truly a bijection.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:55.970
And you need to know how many
sequences or maps to the same--

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.350
to the same hand.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:01.612
So the guidelines
are as follows.

01:05:01.612 --> 01:05:05.330
They're pretty
straightforward actually.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:09.420
First of all, if
we have a function

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:14.470
f that maps from A to
B, then we would really

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:19.250
like to check very carefully
whether the number-- what

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:24.580
is the number of
elements of A that are

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:38.380
mapped to each element of B?

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:43.080
So we check how many to one
of a mapping this really is.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.760
And after this we will then
apply the division rule.

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:53.870
It's very important
to check this.

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:56.980
But very often, we're
making mistakes.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.920
For example, right now
I'm doing some research

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.030
and I've been
counting something.

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:06.689
Turns out it-- if I
use a different method

01:06:06.689 --> 01:06:08.730
to count the same thing
I get a different answer.

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.820
So I made a mistake somewhere.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.590
So that's the second guideline.

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:17.360
So what you want to
do is you want to try

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.704
and solving a problem
in multiple ways.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.680
So try solving a problem
in a different way.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.010
And especially with counting
this is very helpful.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.420
So this will lead
to an extra check.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.545
So we will do that for
this particular example.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.270
And it generally
would always like

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:49.780
to find multiple ways to
prove things, I would say,

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:55.160
because at least you want
to have multiple-- maybe not

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.630
a complete proof but
subparts of proofs--

01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.480
you may want to find different
ways why that is true.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.380
So that's how I usually
do my proofing of things.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:11.370
So let's find a second way
to count this over here,

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:13.720
to do the double check.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.220
So we're going to create a
different representation that

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.750
should actually
lead to a bijection.

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.675
So I want to find a
representation that's

01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:29.020
a bijection, a 1-to-1 mapping.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.730
So how do we do this?

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:41.090
I can-- let me see where I am.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:41.590
OK.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:48.470
So what I could do
is, first of all,

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:54.260
I can choose the values
of the two pairs.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.220
So in this case, I have
the values 3 and the queen.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.700
So how many choices do I have?

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, I can choose
two out of 13 choices.

01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:11.340
Secondly, I'm going to describe
the suit of the smaller

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.920
pair which is uniquely defined
because they have two values.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.430
One is smaller and the
suit of the smaller

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:27.500
pair I can choose by taking one
out the four-- two out of four

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:32.950
choices because I need to choose
two suits for the smaller pair.

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.840
For the larger
pair, I do the same.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.680
And I get 4 choose 2.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.936
Now, again, I have the
value of the extra card.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.399
And I have 11 choices.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:56.090
I have already chosen two so
there are 11 choices left.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:09:00.600
And finally, the suit
for the extra card

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.660
can be done in 4 choose 1 ways.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.290
So if you multiply
those together,

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:10.990
we get 13 times 12 divided by 2.

01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:18.310
And then we get times 4 choose 2
times 4 choose 2 times 11 times

01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:19.779
4 choose 1.

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:22.359
And we can see that
that's exactly the same

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.390
as this whole
product divided by 2.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.490
We actually have a bijection.

01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:30.870
This particular representation
is a 1-to-1 mapping.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:33.290
So it's always good
to find a second way

01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:49.910
to prove the same result.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:50.410
OK.

01:09:54.104 --> 01:09:54.895
Let me do one more.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.660
Let's do that over here.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.870
Just to make sure that you
really understand this stuff,

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:15.030
I'm going to count hands
that have each suit in it.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:21.450
So I want to count the
hands with every suit.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:38.020
So as an example, I can
have, say, the 7 of diamonds,

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:44.080
the King of clubs, the 3 of
diamonds, the Ace of hearts,

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.090
and the 2 of spades.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.710
Why is this a proper hand?

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:51.470
Because I can see the diamonds,
the clubs, the hearts,

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.200
and the spades.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.725
So I have a hand in which
every suit is represented.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.520
So what do I do for
my representation?

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:15.150
Well, I can have the
values of each suit

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.870
and I assign a specific
order to those.

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:23.090
So I want to represent for
the diamonds and the clubs

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.830
and the heart and the spade.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:29.440
I want to find out what
values do I really have.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:41.320
So values of each suit in the
order D, C, hearts and spades.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.610
And how many ways do I have?

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:47.876
Well, I have 13
values for the 7,

01:11:47.876 --> 01:11:51.330
I have 13 values for
the King-- for this one,

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:54.210
for this value, 13 values
for that one and 13

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.690
values for this one.

01:11:56.690 --> 01:12:00.430
So that is pretty
straightforward.

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.130
Now, we still have
the extra card.

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:10.340
And the extra card
has a suit which

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.950
I can do in four ways
because of four choices.

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:18.540
And finally, it
also has a value.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:27.520
And the value is-- it's
actually-- so how much is this?

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.430
Can this be 13?

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.920
Are there 13 values?

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.910
No, not really, right?

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:37.580
Because for each possible
given suit that I've chosen,

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:43.880
I already chose a
value before when

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.610
I chose a value for the
suit that I did over here.

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:52.030
So for example, this
one cannot be the 7,

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.330
it has to be something else.

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:55.100
There are 12 choices.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.550
If I would have chose
a different suit,

01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:59.400
for example hearts,
then I would not

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.800
be able to choose the Ace
because I already have chosen

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.050
the Ace in the first step.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.890
So I have 12 possibilities here.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:11.260
So this is not 13.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.630
You may want to
check that again.

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:19.690
So now let's give the
representation for this one.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:23.180
So I can have diamonds, clubs--
so let's see, in the order

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.260
of diamonds, clubs.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.640
So I have the 7,
I have a King, I

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.000
have for hearts I have an
Ace, for spades I have a 2.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.450
Then I have the suit for the
extra card which is a diamonds.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:42.990
And then a value which is a 3.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.960
Now we are going
to check according

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.080
to our guidelines over here.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.370
We're going to check
the number of elements

01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:55.160
that are-- the number
of sequences that

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.940
map to the same hand over here.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.830
So is this a bijection?

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:03.690
It's not, right?

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.200
So why is this not a bijection?

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.450
Well, we can also have
the following situation

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:18.340
where we swap the 3 diamonds
and the 7 diamonds around.

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.800
So we choose the
3 for the diamonds

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.440
and then we have the
King, the Ace and the 2.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.070
then we have the fifth card
which is also diamonds,

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:31.530
but now it's the 7.

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:37.720
Well, this one also maps
to this particular hand.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.370
So we have a 2-to-1 mapping.

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:45.420
And we conclude that the
total number of hands,

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:50.630
where every suit is represented,
is 13 to the power 4 times

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:54.600
4 times 12 by the
generalized product rule.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.970
And now by the division rule,
we have to still divide by 2.

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.376
So that's the total number.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:03.620
OK.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.950
So now we come to
combinatorial proofs.

01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:12.095
So this is a new
proof technique.

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:18.840
And what we're
going to do is we're

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.610
going to count a set
in two different ways.

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:27.440
And that will lead to a
combinatorial equation.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.890
So the whole idea is as follows.

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:34.680
So let me give an example first.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.270
So for a combinatorial
proof, for example,

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:51.460
suppose I have n
shirts and I want

01:15:51.460 --> 01:16:01.760
to choose-- I want to keep k
and I want to trash n minus k.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:07.050
So how do I count the number
of choices that I have?

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:10.916
Well, I can choose, out of n,
I can choose the k keepers.

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.460
But I also can count
it in a different way.

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.680
I can also count
this as how many ways

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.390
I can select the trashers.

01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:28.910
So there are n minus k out of
n shirts that I will trash.

01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:35.220
So there are two different
ways to count the same choices

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.670
that I have.

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:42.130
So we have an
equation over here.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:45.040
And you already know this
one because by the definition

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.540
of the binomial
coefficient, we have

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.080
that this is equal to this.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.000
And so it's pretty
straightforward.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.070
It's equal to this
one over here.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.990
But the idea is that
we're going to count

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.510
a set in two different ways.

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:08.820
So another example is where
we have the following.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:18.660
We choose a team of k elements.

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:31.180
Of k elements out
of-- oh, actually, I'm

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.280
talking about a team.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.640
I was talking about
students here.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.655
Of k students.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.750
Out of n students.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:44.260
Now, how many ways
can I do this?

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.450
Well, n choose k, right?

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.440
Well, there is a way to
count this differently.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:56.360
I could also say, well, let's
first count the total number

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:02.980
of ways in which I choose k
students that includes Bob.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.260
So let's do that.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:13.050
So Bob is one of the
students, and if I

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:18.860
count the number
of teams with Bob,

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.270
how many choices do I have?

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.590
I choose Bob.

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:29.650
I still need to choose k minus
1 students out of the remaining

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:30.770
n minus 1 students.

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:32.330
So I have taken out Bob.

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:34.700
So there are n minus
1 students left

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.935
and I still need to
choose k minus 1 students.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.820
The other possibility is that
we have teams that-- in which

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.880
Bob is not represented.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:54.310
So now we need to
choose k students out

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:56.980
off all the students minus Bob.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:01.190
So we have n minus 1 choose k.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:05.350
So by the sum rule, we can
just add those two together

01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:09.050
and that should be equal
to all the possibilities

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:12.070
to choose team of k students.

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.990
So what do I see?

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:18.070
I see that n minus 1 choose k
minus 1 plus n minus 1 choose

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:23.270
k should be equal to--
well, before I counted it

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:29.330
as this-- so it should
be equal to n choose k.

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:32.495
And this is called
Pascal's Identity.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:39.110
And the general idea is is
that we do the following.

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:46.710
So we are actually counting
a set in two different ways.

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:49.990
That's what we did so far.

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:52.980
And when you solve
these types of problems,

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:58.740
the difficulty is that you
will need to define the set S.

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.240
So usually you
get a problem, you

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.830
need to prove some
equation like this.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:07.790
So you define a set S.
That's the hard part of it.

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:12.590
Then we are going to show
that the cardinality of S

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:17.550
is some number n,
say, in one way.

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.770
So we have one
method to do this.

01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:20.680
By counting.

01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:33.210
And we will show that S is also
equal to some other number--

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.260
like, in this case,
we had one number

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.600
and this was my second
one-- also by counting.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.270
And then we can
conclude that n--

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:47.532
so we conclude that n equals m.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.440
So we're almost done
because I'm going

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:58.980
to prove to you a very simple
equation using this technique.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.312
But it is not as trivial as
the one that we saw just now.

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:08.570
What we do now is the following.

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:11.380
We want to prove a
theorem that says

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.320
that if a sum r is 0 all
the way up to n, then,

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.520
if you take the product of the
following binomial coefficients

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:26.370
n choose r times 2n
choose n minus r,

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:30.460
this is equal to 3n choose n.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.670
We need to prove this.

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.950
So we need to find
the proper set.

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:36.249
So how can we think about it?

01:21:36.249 --> 01:21:37.790
Well, the idea is
that we're probably

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:43.020
going to choose n elements
out of 3n elements.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.620
We're going to do
it in a special way.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:50.890
And so the proof
will be as follows.

01:21:50.890 --> 01:22:05.050
We take S to be all the
subsets of n balls chosen

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:19.990
from a basket of n red
balls and 2n green balls.

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:22.540
And this will do the trick.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:25.310
So how do we do this?

01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:32.690
We're going to first choose
the red balls and then

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:35.110
the green balls.

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:40.360
So let's first count S
in the very easy way.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.570
Well, I just choose n balls
out of a basket of 3n balls.

01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:47.100
I don't care how many
green or red balls I have.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:51.465
So I have really 3n
choose n choices.

01:22:53.990 --> 01:23:09.660
This is the number of n element
subsets from a 3n element set.

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.507
So that's easy.

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:16.860
Now, we can also count
it in a different way.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:22.480
We first of all wonder
about the number of subsets

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.430
with exactly r red balls.

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:28.710
So how many are there?

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:32.220
Well, we choose r red balls
so we have n red balls.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.760
So we need to choose
r out of those.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.690
Now, in total, I need
to choose n balls.

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:41.700
So I still need to choose
n minus r balls out

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.830
of the set of green balls.

01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:46.950
I have 2n green balls.

01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:50.630
I'm going to choose n minus
r green balls over here.

01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:55.130
So these are the red balls
that I select and here

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.420
are the green balls.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.500
Now we'll use the sum rule.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.760
And I add all the
different possible subsets

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.310
with 0 red balls, with
1 red ball, 2 red balls,

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:07.960
all the way up to n red balls.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:19.360
So essentially, I get the
sum by the sum rule of r 0

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.330
all the way up to n where I
count the number of subsets

01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:27.730
with exactly r red balls.

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:31.110
So that means I can choose
r out of the n red balls

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:37.190
and another n minus r out of
the 2n balls-- 2n green balls.

01:24:37.190 --> 01:24:39.360
So now we equate
those two together

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.430
and that proves the theorem.

01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:45.710
So the really hard part
in this type of proofs

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:51.130
is that you need some creativity
to find and define that set S

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:53.020
and see how that would work.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.230
And the way to do that usually
is to look at this equation

01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:58.390
and then say, oh,
wait a minute, I'm

01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:02.860
going to talk about sets because
I choose n out of 3n over here.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.940
So out of 3n elements.

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.810
And maybe I can
divide up the sets

01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:09.780
in some kind of specific choice.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.540
So tomorrow during
recitation you

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:15.630
will also see
combinatorial proof.

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:17.680
Thank you.

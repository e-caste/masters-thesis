00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.290
PROFESSOR: Now
generally speaking,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.226
a proof is going to have
seven characteristics

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:29.650
that you want to keep in mind.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.470
Good proofs are correct--
that's obviously important--

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.930
complete-- you've got to
have all the details there.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
All of the key steps
have to be there.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.580
They should be clear so we can
understand what's going on.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.300
Brief is good.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.630
You don't want to crush
somebody with all the details.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.570
You want to get to the
key points, and be crisp.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.330
It's really nice
if they're elegant.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.320
Now, that means clever.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.397
It's the mathematician's
notion of beauty.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.730
Like you go to the art museum,
and the artists will say,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.210
wow, that's a
beautiful painting.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.160
In mathematics, you say,
wow, that's an elegant proof.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.410
It's crisp, clever,
short, to the point.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.040
And it's really the
highest compliment

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.770
you can get from a
mathematician, anyway.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.882
And there's a lot of
judgment that goes into that.

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:42.340
Just like in art--
there's judgment

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.382
over what is great art.

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:45.840
The proof should
be well organized.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.950
For example, use
lemmas the same way

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.500
you would use
subroutines in writing

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.400
code-- helps to make it clear.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.105
And the proof
should be in order.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.030
Sometimes you'll see
proofs where things are

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.950
done in a haphazard fashion.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.810
All the pieces are there, but
they're in the wrong order.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.120
Sometimes-- and they teach
this in some high schools--

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.790
they teach you to
do proofs backwards.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850
And the classic thing
there is, say you're

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.600
trying to prove a equals b.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.530
Well, the proof sometimes
will start with what

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080
you're trying to prove.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.200
And then they'll do
a bunch of steps.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.270
And then you'll end
up with 1 equals 1,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.900
and you'll write a
check, because you went

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440
from a equals b to 1 equals 1.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.510
And that's, of course, true.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.250
Now, that's not a
good thing to do.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.400
It can be correct if the
implications go this way.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.520
Because really, you're starting
with a fact-- 1 equals 1--

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.160
and deriving a equals b.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.000
So if, in fact, the
implications work this way,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.720
then your proof is right.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.930
But most people, especially
as you get farther along,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.470
think about it going
from top to bottom.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.330
So don't use this technique,
because it'll confuse people.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.940
You're liable to make a mistake.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.790
Just start with 1 equals 1
and work your way from there--

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.210
top down for being in order.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.090
Now, good proofs are
very much like good code.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750
In fact, one of the reasons we
care so much about teaching you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.990
how to write a good
proof in computer science

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.180
is so that later on,
you'll be able to prove

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.550
that your programs are doing
what you expect-- what they're

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.680
supposed to do.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.325
Now, there are many famous
examples where programs did not

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:40.700
do what they were
supposed to do,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.340
with disastrous consequences.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.800
The Airbus A300 was one of the
first commercial jets totally

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.720
operated by software.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.140
It could take off, fly, and
land totally by software.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.600
It was a major advance
in the airline industry.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.110
The only problem
was, that on one

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.140
of the first
flights of the A300,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.240
the software accidentally
opened the rear door just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.580
before landing.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.940
And the plane
crashed as a result.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.740
It was the first plane crash
in commercial history because

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.130
of a software bug.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.589
There's a famous radiation
device for cancer patients

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.970
called the Therac-25.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.350
It's famous because it
got into a race condition

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.070
occasionally, which
caused the device

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.310
to just slam the patient
with radiation-- so much so,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.700
it killed the patient.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.960
And they had multiple examples
of this, and of course,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.490
a lot of lawsuits afterwards.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.764
How many of you all
remember the 2000 election?

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:40.430
A few of you do.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.320
OK, this will probably be the
last class that remembers that.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.030
But that's where Al Gore was
going up against George Bush--

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.930
very close election-- all
came down to recounting

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.060
the votes in Florida.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.370
But in fact, Al Gore got
negative 16,000 votes

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.590
in one county because
of a software bug

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.150
in the electronic
voting booths, which

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.501
I think they got rid of a
lot of them in the election

00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:05.000
after that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.010
Because the software was buggy.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.840
So poor Al had enough
problem which chads

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.090
and funny business in Florida.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.580
But getting negative
16,000 votes certainly

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.890
didn't help his chances.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.820
Several years ago, a
single faulty command

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.320
in a computer system used by
United and American Airlines

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.800
grounded the entire fleets
to both airlines for close

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.210
to a day.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.050
Because they
couldn't do anything.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.480
They're all run by computer, and
the whole thing was screwed up.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.400
So there's lots more examples.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.790
We run into this issue
all the time at Akamai.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.760
Akamai is a company started
by MIT folks-- by myself,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.850
and Danny Lewin, and a dozen
undergrads in the late 1990s.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.720
And we deliver a
lot of the content

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.850
you get on the web-- Facebook,
all the search engines.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.790
A lot of the stuff you go
to comes from our servers.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.710
So we've got to be
very careful that we

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.039
don't have software bugs.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:58.830
Now, in fact we do.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.710
And we catch them
every once in awhile.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.594
But if we got a bad
one, it would bring down

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:03.760
all the sites you go to you.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.855
You wouldn't be able to
go to those sites anymore.

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:06.980
And everybody would notice.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.355
It would be sort
of embarrassing.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.680
Now, this really does matter.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.380
And this is going to sound a
little scary, but someday--

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.620
probably 30, 20 years
from now, somewhere

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.080
in there-- it's possible
that all of us, our lives

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.490
may depend on the software
that some of you write.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.010
In fact, to bring this
home how scary it is,

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.550
look at the person
sitting next to you.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.750
And imagine that in 25
years, your life depends on

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.280
whether their code
does what it's

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.820
supposed to do-- little scary.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.340
That's why we are
very motivated to help

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.660
you learn how to make
rock-solid arguments,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.290
so you don't have code that
fries one of your classmates

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.040
someday, or puts him in
a bad plane situation.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.100
Now unfortunately,
writing rock-solid proofs

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.910
is a very hard thing to do.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.380
Even the world's
best mathematicians

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.550
mess them up on a regular basis.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.570
In fact, it's estimated that one
third of all published proofs

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.330
have bugs, have flaws, that
render the proof incorrect.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.040
The trouble often arises
because we get lazy.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.570
We don't write down all the
details or all the steps.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.880
Because, wow, it's clear.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.740
Let's just move on.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.330
Now, this can be OK.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.010
Not such a good practice,
but it dramatically

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.100
increases the chances
of making a mistake.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.650
And there's some
very famous examples

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.274
in the math literature
from the world's

00:07:48.274 --> 00:07:50.320
most famous mathematicians.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.837
Gauss-- and we'll
talk about Gauss

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.670
later during the term--
he's one of the most

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.420
famous mathematicians ever.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.640
He wrote his PhD thesis in 1799.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.440
And it's usually referred to
as the first rigorous proof

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.350
of the fundamental
theorem of algebra.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.130
And that says that
every polynomial

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.410
has a 0 over the complex
numbers-- something

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.325
probably a lot of you
learned in high school.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.200
You get a polynomial.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
You can find roots
of the polynomial

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.100
over the complex numbers.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.580
But his thesis contains
the following quote,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.730
"If a branch of an algebraic
curve enters a bounded region,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.870
it must necessarily leave again.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.480
Nobody, to my knowledge,
has ever doubted this fact."

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.679
Warning signs-- buzzers-- should
be going off in your brain.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.090
"But if anybody desires it,
then on another occasion,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.100
I intend to give a demonstration
which will leave no doubt."

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.620
So he's using something
that he believes to be true.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.420
He sort of thinks it's clear,
that everybody knows it.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.530
But he writes this down.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.946
And when you're
writing that down,

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:52.730
you know there's a problem.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.700
And in fact, there's
another Fields medalist--

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.800
we talked about Fields medals
last week-- Stephen Smale

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.650
writes that this was an immense
gap in the proof that was not

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.500
filled until 1920-- more
than 100 years later.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.310
So Gauss never could
give the proof,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.870
and nobody did for
over a century more.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.830
Remember the Poincare
conjecture from last week?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.210
We had Colbert
talking about that.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:22.440
In 1900, Poincare claimed
it was a simple fact.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.790
Four years later, he
decided it wasn't so simple,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.600
and he demoted his claim to
the status of a conjecture.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.240
And of course, this became the
famous Poincare conjecture,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.480
which took another
century to solve.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.380
So when you think you
see yourself doing this,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.714
famous mathematicians do it
too, and it catches them.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.130
So you want to not
try to do that.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.260
Now, in fact, just to
really bring home the point,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.940
we've made a top 10
list of proof techniques

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.330
you should not use in 6.042.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.624
So everybody go to
the handout here.

00:09:54.624 --> 00:09:56.540
In fact, there's lot of
them on the back, too,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.730
but on the front page,
there's the top 10.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.220
So we're going to
go through these.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.910
These are the ones
we've most observed

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.020
in 6.042 over the years.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.270
Number 10-- proof by
throwing in the kitchen sink.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.930
The author writes down every
theorem known to mankind,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.445
and then adds a few
more for good measure.

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:16.820
Now, this is good, because
when you're questioned later--

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.780
you're trying to get a
better score on your exam--

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.810
you say, look, the proof
contains all the key facts.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.010
They're all here.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.030
And so that does help.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.030
You get extra credit if
all the facts are there.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.267
We are literally seen students
copy over their crib sheet,

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.350
if they got enough time,
for a problem they're not

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.250
knowing how to solve, just to
get all of the facts in there.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.590
Number nine-- proof by example--
the author gives the case n

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.290
equals 2 and
suggests it contains

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.166
most of the ideas of
the general proof.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.540
In fact, a student
before a class

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.690
was telling me on one of
the homework problems,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.410
he talked about it to
his non-math friends,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.220
and they gave examples,
not the proof.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.210
Number eight-- proof by
vigorous hand-waving-- one

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.440
of my favorites-- I get
up here and wave my hands.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.575
And it must be true.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.890
Number seven-- proof by
cumbersome notation--

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.080
here the reader gets
hopelessly confused,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.060
gives up, and says OK.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.130
In fact, I once
had a grad student,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.740
and we called him the
encryptor, because he

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.900
could take the simplest proof
and so encrypt it in notation

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.170
and God knows what, you could
never understand the proof

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.990
and figure out if it was
really right or wrong.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.520
That goes well with number
six-- proof by exhaustion--

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.850
so does throwing in
the kitchen sink.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.870
Number five--
proof by omission--

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.680
you will see that a lot,
also by faculty-- "The reader

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.300
may easily supply the details.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.150
The other cases are
analogous-- trivial."

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.400
Experts use that all the time.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.340
You can find a lot
of my papers online.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.840
"The proof is
trivial"-- very bad.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.920
Every once in a while, it
turned out not to be so trivial.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.170
Number four-- proof by
picture-- we've seen those,

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.000
saw one on Tuesday.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.230
Number three-- proof by
vehement assertion-- sort

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.800
of like the hand-waving.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.780
The more forceful you
are in your argument,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.400
the higher you raise your
voice, the more intimidating

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.160
you become, doesn't
make it more true.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.350
Number two-- proof by appeal
to intuition-- you say,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.230
"any moron knows that."

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.480
Well, you're sort of
reluctant to now question it.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.430
And then number one-- proof by
reference to eminent authority.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.480
I saw Fermat on the elevator
and he said he had a proof.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.330
I don't think so.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.420
Fermat's been dead
for over 300 years.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.840
And he was not so reliable
in the first place.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.940
In fact, he has one of
the most famous assertions

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.860
that turned into a conjecture,
called Fermat's last theorem.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.425
And it was not really a
theorem by the time he died.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.860
How many people have heard
of Fermat's last theorem?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.010
Raise your hand.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.920
Yeah, pretty famous.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.935
It's the one theorem he proved
that actually, he didn't prove.

00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:59.850
It says, for all
n bigger than 2,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:08.220
there does not exist an x, y,
and z in the natural numbers

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.040
plus the positive natural
numbers such that x to the n

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.540
plus y to the n
equals z to the n.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.370
Now of course, for
n equals 2, that's

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.580
just the Pythagorean theorem.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.180
You can find three,
four, and five, when

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.860
you square them satisfy that.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.970
But it says this does not
work for any higher value,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.360
any higher power, than 2.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.030
Now in 1637, Fermat wrote
in the margin of a block

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.410
that he had discovered
a proof of this result,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.510
but the proof was too
long to fit in the margin.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.870
And so he wasn't going to
supply the details there.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.730
And he never did
supply the details.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.750
And it took 350 years and
100s and 100s of pages.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.860
A fellow named Andrew
Wiles-- took him personally

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.710
over 10 years.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.620
He more or less locked
himself in his room

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.360
for 10 years, produced
100s of pages,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.350
and he finally did prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.520
So Fermat was right
about one thing--

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.224
it would not fit in the margin.

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:09.640
At least, there's
no proof that we

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.990
know of that would fit
in the margin of a book.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.480
Any questions on
proof technique?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.840
We're going to pound a lot on
this over the next few weeks.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.650
All right, next
we're going to look

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:31.850
at a class of puzzles that was
very popular in the late 1800s.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.390
Now, in these puzzles, you have
a grid of letters or numbers.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.130
And you've got to slide the
letters and numbers around

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.750
to put them in order.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.440
And so as an example, here's
the problem on a three

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.050
by three grid, or
an eight puzzle.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:15:00.570
You want to find a
sequence of moves

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:07.160
to go from this configuration.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.370
I'll do a three by three case.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.060
I have a here, b
here, c, d, e, f.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.530
And I've put g and
h out of order.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.820
And that square is blank, and
I can move tiles or letters

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.600
into it.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.670
I'm going to start here.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.170
And I eventually want to
get to the configuration

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.620
where the letters are all
in alphabetical order.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.270
So g and h are in order.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.430
Now, a legal move means
you slide a letter

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.910
into an adjacent blank square.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.100
And you can go in
a row or a column.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.870
OK, everybody
understand the game,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.680
what you're supposed to do?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.810
You slide these things.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.680
That could go down.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.600
That could go across.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.450
How many people played
a game like this before?

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.040
Good, a lot of you.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.270
OK, so I need some
volunteers who

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.120
are good at solving
puzzles that can do this,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.500
have played games like this,
that are pretty quick at it.

00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:35.280
So I've got it here.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.166
Who would like to come down?

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.790
There are prizes if
you can solve this.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.655
What we're going to
do is solve this.

00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.530
And see if you can solve
it in three minutes.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.170
But I need three students
to come on down and do this.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.360
Who'd like to volunteer?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.665
Who thinks they can handle
puzzles under pressure?

00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:54.470
So you have the g
and h out of order.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.695
So it's not so hard.

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:58.960
You move the f down there.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.977
I don't know, play
around like that.

00:17:02.977 --> 00:17:04.060
So I need some volunteers.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.210
Who'd like to come
down and do this?

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.089
You can win candy.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.589
I've got candy here.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.609
There's even a prize if you
don't make it in three minutes.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.109
Who wants some candy?

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:17.610
Nobody?

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.150
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.940
What's that?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.170
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.670
There is.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.750
Come on down.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.250
All right, now, who's
going to help him out?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.490
I need a couple more people
here just to mess him up,

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.434
because by himself--
there we go-- good.

00:17:31.434 --> 00:17:32.850
Anybody else like
to come on down?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.266
Because if we get
three, it really

00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:37.070
gets hard, because you fight
over what moves to make.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.370
Now, what I'd like you
all to do is sort of

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.746
scream out
possibilities for him.

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:42.620
Like he figures it out
there, you scream out,

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.000
that'll really screw him up.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.339
OK, now, you can't pick them up.

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:47.880
You've just got to
slide them around.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.324
And you can go, and
we'll go to 2:56,

00:17:50.324 --> 00:17:51.490
and see if you can solve it.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.470
If you can solve it,
you guys get candy.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.723
And if you can figure it out
out there, let them know.

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:02.190
Slide to the gray area.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.780
No, you can't use the gray area.

00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:08.270
All right, you've got
about two minutes.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.477
They have the g and h in order.

00:18:10.477 --> 00:18:12.560
Everything else is pretty
well screwed up, though.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:15.760
What do you got?

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.900
A, b, c, d, e, f, h g-- no, no,
no, that's where you started,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.400
guys.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.750
That's not it.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.790
It was close, just one
was out of order is all.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.850
Just one letter at a time.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.430
There you go.

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:44.060
I think they need help.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.710
We got about a minute ago.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.892
Cannot see anything.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:47.850
You can't see anything.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.350
Well, I don't know
if it would help.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.330
You want to show
them where you are?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.570
This is not looking good.

00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:12.655
We're pretty close to
the end here, guys.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:23.020
A, b, c, f, e, d,
g, h-- g, h is good.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.070
F is not so good.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.965
All right, you got
about 30 seconds.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.530
Whoa, what are you guys doing?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.740
One at a time here.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.566
One at the time.

00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:53.520
In fact, I think
time is up here.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.640
All right, 2:56.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.020
Oh, no, no.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.110
That we don't do.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.020
No diagonal moves--
no, no, no, no.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.680
All right, well, you
guys were good sports,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.950
so you do get a prize.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.200
It's not the candy, but I have
these wonderful plastic Nerd

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.139
Pride pocket protectors for you.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.430
There you go, very good sports.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.570
Thank you, well done.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.400
All right.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.780
Now, I was a little
cruel to these guys,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.780
for a lot of reasons.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.830
It's impossible?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.162
You think?

00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:42.930
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.590
Yeah it is impossible.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.610
This is impossible to do.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.470
Let's see if we can
prove it's impossible.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.230
Because it doesn't seem
so hard, necessarily.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.940
But let's take
that as a theorem.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:16.990
There is no sequence
of legal moves--

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:26.680
diagonal moves makes this a
lot easier-- to invert g and h

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:37.530
and also return all the other
letters to their original order

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.106
or position.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.790
Now, to prove this,
we're going to use

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.530
what's called an invariant.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.910
It's a very powerful
and commonly used

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.470
concept in computer science,
very closely tied to induction,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.500
as we'll see.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.800
In order to show that
your system can never

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.580
reach a particular
special state,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.900
it is sufficient to show
there's some property called

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.880
the invariant that holds
at the initial state,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.540
and that is preserved
by every legal move,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.770
and is not present-- does not
hold-- in that special state.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.230
The idea is, if you get
this magic property called

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.540
the invariant and it
holds at the start,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.150
and it holds across
every step, then

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.640
the only states
you can reach have

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.450
to have to have the
property, be invariant.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.850
And if the special state
doesn't have that property,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.060
you can't reach it.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.970
All right, so there
is going to be

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.130
some property we're going
to look for that held

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.110
at the beginning here-- and
the beginning had this set

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:59.420
up-- that holds, is
preserved, by every move,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.800
every legal move, but does
not hold in this state.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.527
And therefore, you can never
reach this state legally.

00:23:06.527 --> 00:23:07.360
So they were doomed.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.710
So we've got to figure
out what that property is.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.730
And that's always the
trick in analyzing

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.790
systems or
algorithms-- is what's

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.930
that key property, the
invariant property?

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.680
So to figure out the
invariant, we sort of

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.700
have to look at what
happens during a move

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.080
in this system-- a transition.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.130
Well, there's two
kinds of moves.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.080
There's a row move.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:45.590
And an example of a
row move is you might

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:53.560
have a, b, c, d, g, e, f, h.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.810
And I'm going to move the g
its row to the blank square.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.812
So it would become this state.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.720
So g moves rightward
into the blank,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.020
and the rest stays the same.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.150
Now, when I make a row
move, did the relative order

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.135
of the items change?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.624
No.

00:24:21.624 --> 00:24:23.040
Of course, to be
precise, I better

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.280
define what relative order
means, or the natural order.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:39.210
So by the natural order, I mean
this ordering-- 1, 2 3, 4, 5,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.100
6, 7, 8, 9.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.070
So if I look at the order
here, g moved from 5 to 6,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.090
but didn't change
order with respect

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.150
to any of the other guys.

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:54.040
Let's state that as a lemma.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.490
Because that'll be very useful.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:21.920
Lemma 1-- a row move
does not change the order

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.940
of the items or the letters.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.590
Proof-- well, it's obvious.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.640
No, you can't let me get
away with that, right?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.490
Because I'm not to let you get
away with that on homework.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.120
That's not so good.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.140
So we've got to be a little
more careful in the proof here.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.580
Otherwise, we just head
down the path to trouble.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.520
So let's sort of specify,
what does a row move

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.450
mean-- just get a little bit
of math and specification

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.140
around it.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:13.720
Well, in a row move,
we move an item--

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:23.680
a letter-- from some
cell i, whatever

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:30.170
i-- it could be anything 1
to 9-- into an adjacent cell.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.720
What are the possibilities
for the adjacent cell?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:50.120
Plus or minus 1, yeah, into
cell i minus 1 or i plus 1.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.085
Nothing else moves.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:05.920
Hence, the order of
the items is preserved.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.600
Because if you're going
with i to i plus 1,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.450
everything else is in i minus
1 or less, i plus 2 or more.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.790
Relative order does not
change in this case.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.570
And I'll claim that's enough.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.910
You know that I've thought
about it a little bit.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.820
I've really quantified that i
goes to i minus 1 or i plus 1.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.460
Nothing else moves.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.780
Therefore, we're done.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.920
Now, I could've added
some more sentences here,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.400
like I talked about.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.050
But this is probably enough
in this case, for this guy.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.400
So in fact, if we
only had row moves,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.650
there's not much that happens.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.184
The order never
changes with row moves.

00:27:57.184 --> 00:27:58.100
So we never get there.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.683
But column moves are
more interesting.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:19.042
So as an example of a column
move, a, b, c, d, f, h, e,

00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:23.220
g-- say I move the g up.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:33.000
Then I would get this one--
a, b, c, d, f, g-- because g

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.420
moved up-- h, e.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.550
So g went to there.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.690
Did the ordering
change for this move?

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.300
Yeah.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.450
How so?

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.570
What things changed order?

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.630
Which pairs of
letters changed order?

00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:56.540
AUDIENCE: G changed [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.450
PROFESSOR: G changed by three--
moved three in the order.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.837
And what letters did it
change relative order with?

00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:07.831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:09.830
AUDIENCE: The two preceding it.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
two preceding it.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.790
g used to be after h and e.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.070
Now it's before h and e.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.750
All right, so it changed
relative order with two items.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.300
It changed its
position by three.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.100
It moved up three
in the ordering.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.020
And so it changed order
with the two in between.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.630
Let's look at another one.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.760
Because we're really
doing these examples

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.190
to hunt for an
invariant, is what

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.530
we're trying to do
here-- something

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.710
that will let us prove we can
never get to the desired state.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.750
Let's look at this one.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:54.050
a, b, c, d, g, h,
e, f goes to-- I'm

00:29:54.050 --> 00:30:05.680
going to move b down this
time-- a, c, d, b, g, h, e, f.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.225
So b moves down.

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:12.470
The relative order changes.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.120
Which pairs got changed
in the relative order?

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.820
AUDIENCE: b.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.264
PROFESSOR: b changed with--

00:30:22.264 --> 00:30:23.430
AUDIENCE: c and [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.070
PROFESSOR: c and d.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.380
b used to be before c and
d. when it moves down here,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.160
it goes after c and d.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.580
Any guess about what
Lemma Two is going to be?

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.544
What happens when we
make a column move?

00:30:40.544 --> 00:30:41.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.192
PROFESSOR: Change the order of--

00:30:44.192 --> 00:30:45.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.770
PROFESSOR: Good,
so a column move

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.971
changes the order of a
guy with the previous two

00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:58.470
or the next two, which means
the relative order of two pairs

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.887
change.

00:30:59.887 --> 00:31:01.220
So let's take that as Lemma Two.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.660
When we say don't
do proof by example,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.220
we don't mean
don't try examples.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.300
Because by trying
examples, you find out

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.370
what you're trying to prove.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.680
So that's good to do.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:39.600
A column move changes the
relative order of precisely two

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.670
pairs of items.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.750
So let's prove that.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:32:12.010
In a column move, we move
an item in cell i for some i

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:22.642
to a blank spot in cell what?

00:32:22.642 --> 00:32:24.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.334
PROFESSOR: i minus
3 or i plus 3?

00:32:27.334 --> 00:32:28.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.590
PROFESSOR: OK, and just to
see that, let's draw out

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.340
the natural order.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.890
I've got 1 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.690
Column moves could be here--
1 to 4, and 4 to 1, 2 and 5,

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:51.880
3 and 6, 4 and 7,
5 and 8, 6 and 9.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.810
All 12 possible column
moves, this works for.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.310
They're always separated by 3.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:17.080
And when an item
moves three positions,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.540
it changes relative order
with two other items.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.950
And you can even write
down what they are.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:36.942
It's i minus 1, i minus
2, or i plus 1, i plus 2.

00:33:36.942 --> 00:33:38.650
Those are the guys it
changes order with.

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:44.100
All right, we've
got two lemmas here.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.380
That one's done now.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.100
In a row move, order
does not change.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:55.070
In a column move, two pairs
of letters get flipped.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.240
That's all you can do
with this puzzle now.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.950
So can anybody
think of something

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.890
we can work with to get an
invariant here-- something

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.460
that won't change?

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.710
What we should be focusing on?

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.070
Yeah.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.990
AUDIENCE: You can only switch
two pairs of items at a time.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:18.380
So if you don't have an
even number [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.850
switch [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.199
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.139
So really, to focus
in on there is,

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.600
if you have an even number
of things out of order

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.620
to start, you're going to
have an even number forever,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.860
because you can only
change two at a time.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.820
That's a great idea.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:38.159
Let's really specify that
now, and define that.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:52.420
A pair of letters or items,
call them L1 and L2--

00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:12.520
they form an inversion, also
known as an inverted pair,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:24.160
if L1 precedes L2
in the alphabet,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.140
but L1 appears after
L2 in the puzzle.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.470
All right, so that
is an inversion.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.960
So for example, let's
see how many inversions

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.060
do we have in this case?

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:57.850
We've got a, b,
c, f, d, g, e, h.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.550
How many inversions are there
in that state of the puzzle?

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.070
Yeah?

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:14.950
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.908
PROFESSOR: Three, good.

00:36:15.908 --> 00:36:17.866
And what are they?

00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:20.130
AUDIENCE: d is after f.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, d,
f is an inversion.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.600
e, f is an inversion.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.480
And what's the last one?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.250
AUDIENCE: e, g.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.320
PROFESSOR: e, g is an inversion.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.430
Yes, so the answer is
there's three inversions

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.680
in this puzzle.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.960
And if I keep doing
row and column

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.200
moves to this, what do
I know about the parity

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.746
of the number of inversions?

00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:50.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.040
PROFESSOR: Will always be odd--
that's sort of interesting.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:02.180
OK, now, how many inverted pairs
are there in the start state

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.100
way back over here?

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.440
How many inverted pairs here?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.215
One inversion.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.986
How many inversions here?

00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:18.485
Zero.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.350
All right, and can you see where
we're going to head here now?

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:32.080
If I started with
one, that's odd.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.190
And every time I do a
row move or column move,

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.750
it's going to stay odd.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.930
And I can never get here.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.190
Is that clear what
we're trying to do?

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.380
So let's keep doing it.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.350
Let's go over here.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.510
All right, so now we'll
use Lemma One and Lemma Two

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.820
create this notion that we only
change the number of inversions

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.883
by an even number.

00:38:07.883 --> 00:38:28.130
And Lemma Three-- during a
move, the number of inversions

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:42.500
can only increase by
two, decrease by two,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.230
or stay the same.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.210
And this proof is pretty easy.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.060
There's a couple of cases.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:01.250
In a row move, what happens?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.380
How does the number
of inversions

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.629
change in a row move?

00:39:05.629 --> 00:39:06.670
AUDIENCE: Stays the same.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.770
PROFESSOR: Stays the
same-- no changes--

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.090
and that's by Lemma One.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.725
Now, in a column move,
there's three cases.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.432
But we know two pairs
change order-- that we know.

00:39:29.432 --> 00:39:30.140
That's Lemma Two.

00:39:34.117 --> 00:39:35.700
All right, by Lemma
Two, we know that.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.857
But the three cases are-- let
me start on the next board.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:07.850
So Case A is that both
of the inverted pairs

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:14.030
were in order originally,
before the column move.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.720
What happens to the number
of inversions in this case,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.588
as a result of the column move?

00:40:20.588 --> 00:40:21.777
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:21.777 --> 00:40:22.860
PROFESSOR: Goes up by two.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.080
Case B is that both
pairs were inverted

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.250
before I made the column move.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.994
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:39.179
AUDIENCE: Decreases by two.

00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:41.220
PROFESSOR: Decreases by
two-- they were in order,

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.700
so they were inverted.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.010
Now when I flop them,
they become in order.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.470
So inversions drops by two.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.650
And Case C is
there's one of each.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.010
One of the pairs was inverted.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.870
The other wasn't.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.040
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.321
PROFESSOR: Yes, stays the same.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.339
All right, and we're done.

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:13.880
That's what the lemma says-- I
can go up by two, down by two,

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.990
or stay the same.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.820
All right, now a simple
corollary of this

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.200
is that during a move, the
parity-- i.e. even or odd

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.750
of the number of
inversions stays the same.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.870
It can't change at all.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:45.840
During a move, the parity--
and the parity means even, odd.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.590
Sometimes it's called
0, 1, but the evenness

00:41:50.590 --> 00:42:01.460
and the oddness of the number
of inversions does not change.

00:42:08.456 --> 00:42:11.420
AUDIENCE: Instead of two pairs
you mean one pair, right?

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.902
PROFESSOR: Where?

00:42:12.902 --> 00:42:15.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pairs.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.530
PROFESSOR: Oops, I mean
one pair's inverted,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.984
one pair's not.

00:42:19.984 --> 00:42:20.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.860
PROFESSOR: No, I mean two pairs
change order in a column move.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.600
Let's go back and look at that.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.980
So I'm doing a column move.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.490
For example, g goes up.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.470
g, h changes order.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.320
g, e changes order.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.610
g changes order
with these two guys,

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.830
so there's two pairs
that got flipped.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.230
So in a column move, two
pairs reverse their order.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.240
If they were in order,
they become inverted.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.792
If they were inverted,
they become in order.

00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:57.625
Any other questions?

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.350
Yeah.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.270
AUDIENCE: So we're saying
that letters can be

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.160
numbers in more than one pair?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.470
PROFESSOR: Yes, a letter
can be in-- a letter

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:13.250
is in seven pairs, because
there's seven other letters.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:19.000
And in fact, we're looking
at a space of 8 times 7

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.195
divided by 2-- 28
pairs of letters.

00:43:22.195 --> 00:43:26.237
So there could be 28 inversions
if they're all out of order.

00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:27.070
Any other questions?

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.230
OK, well, we're getting there.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.980
We're almost done.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.720
I've got to prove this
corollary that during a move,

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.210
the evenness or oddness of
the number of inversions

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.920
does not change.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.410
And that's because adding or
subtracting 2 from a number

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.440
does not change its parity.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.780
It stays odd or stays even.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:03.450
So adding or subtracting 2
does not change the parity.

00:44:11.987 --> 00:44:14.070
All right, now we're ready
to state the invariant.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:27.930
Anybody tell me what the
invariant is going to be?

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.805
What's the invariant going
to be in this system?

00:44:31.805 --> 00:44:33.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the parity
of the number of inversions

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:41.650
is odd, because it
starts that way.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:42.960
It's preserved.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.720
And it won't hold in
the desired end state

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.182
that we're looking at.

00:44:47.182 --> 00:44:48.515
So we can state that as follows.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:05.810
In every state or
configuration reachable

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:13.530
from the start
state, which is a,

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:21.160
b, c, d, e, f, h, g--
which are out of order--

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:30.690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.440
And the proof will
be by induction.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.750
And invariant proofs
are always by induction.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.100
And the inductive
hypothesis-- and this

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.270
is very typical in
a proof by using

00:45:52.270 --> 00:46:11.910
invariants-- is, so P of n is
after any sequence of n moves

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:17.260
from the start state-- in
fact, just the rest of this

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.020
is what it is.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.280
All right, so our inductive
hypothesis is P of n,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.510
after any sequence of n moves--
so n is the number of moves

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.510
you took to get there--
from the start state,

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.550
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.180
That is the
inductive hypothesis.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.680
This is the invariant.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.380
And they become
one and the same.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.960
And the parameter n is the
number of moves you've taken.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.625
And that's how you set up
a proof using an invariant.

00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:55.774
It always looks just like this.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.220
OK, so we're doing a
proof by induction.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.720
We've got the
inductive hypothesis.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.837
What's the next step?

00:47:24.837 --> 00:47:25.670
AUDIENCE: Base case.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.545
PROFESSOR: Base case.

00:47:32.456 --> 00:47:34.830
And in these circumstances,
where the proof by invariant,

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:37.590
the base case is always 0.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.020
We haven't made any moves yet.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.860
Now in this case, if
we haven't made moves,

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:48.870
the number of inversions in
the start state now is 1.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:55.380
That means the parity is
odd, and the hypothesis

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.230
is satisfied.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.650
P of 0 is true, because in
any sequence of zero moves,

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.092
after this-- i.e.

00:48:02.092 --> 00:48:03.800
in this state-- you've
got one inversion.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.602
That's odd.

00:48:06.602 --> 00:48:08.815
The last step is
the inductive step.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:22.510
And here we need to show for
any n bigger or equal to 0,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:29.980
we need to show P of n implies
p of n plus 1 is true--

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.990
the standard thing.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.770
So let's look at P n plus 1.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.260
That's talking
about where we are

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.550
after a sequence of n plus
1 moves in the puzzle,

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:45.610
from the start state.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:58.790
So let's consider any
sequence of n plus 1 moves.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.545
And call these
moves-- label them

00:49:00.545 --> 00:49:05.394
by M1 all the way to M n plus 1.

00:49:05.394 --> 00:49:06.560
Those are the moves we made.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.680
Now, by the inductive
hypothesis, because of P n,

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.720
we know that after the first n
moves, the parity is still odd.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.170
That's what P n says.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:20.980
That's P n.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.774
After any sequence
of n moves from here,

00:49:24.774 --> 00:49:26.690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.460
So we could say by the
inductive hypothesis,

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:48.450
or we could say by P n, we know
that the parity after moves

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:54.340
M1 out to M n is odd.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.240
Now, by Corollary One-- do
we still have Corollary One?

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.724
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:07.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.140
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE], yeah,
good, we've got Corollary One.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.650
During any move, the
parity doesn't change.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:19.190
That says from after the nth
move to after the n plus 1st

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.141
move-- one extra move--
doesn't change the parity.

00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:22.890
So it's still odd.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:50.080
So next, by Corollary
One, we know

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:59.010
that the parity of the
number of inversions

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.840
does not change
during M n plus 1.

00:51:14.744 --> 00:51:25.710
Therefore, this implies that
the parity after all n plus 1

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:35.340
moves-- these guys-- is odd.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.180
It started odd.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.150
It stayed odd after the first n.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.580
It stayed odd during
the n plus 1st.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.940
So it's odd.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:48.780
And that's exactly the
statement of P n plus 1.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.740
So we've completed
the induction.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.247
We've shown that P n
implies P n plus 1.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:01.241
All right, so now, any
questions so far on this?

00:52:01.241 --> 00:52:01.989
Yeah.

00:52:01.989 --> 00:52:03.947
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between a lemma

00:52:03.947 --> 00:52:05.300
and a corollary?

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.440
PROFESSOR: Really, there's
not a lot of difference.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.450
Corollary usually
is something that's

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.870
a simple consequence
of something else.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.734
And the corollary had
a pretty short proof.

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:19.150
Usually when you see corollary,
that's not a 10-page proof

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.770
there.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.410
A lemma is something
that you're going

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.010
to use as a tool for
a bigger thing, often

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.060
a theorem or another lemma.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.970
In fact, now we're going to
get to the theorem, which

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.820
is sort of the final thing--
the thing we're really after.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.315
And that's sort of the big deal.

00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:35.690
And now the proof
will be simple,

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.512
because we've done all these
lemmas and corollaries.

00:52:38.512 --> 00:52:39.345
Any other questions?

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.840
All right.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.170
In fact, the theorem
is up here, right?

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.040
There is no sequence of legal
moves to invert g and h.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.950
In other words, the
students were screwed.

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:57.060
They couldn't do it fairly.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.400
So let's prove the theorem now.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:39.030
The parity of the
number of inversions

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.520
in the desired state-- i.e.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:51.050
in order-- the target
state-- is even.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:52.160
Nothing's out of order.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.320
There's zero inversions.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:07.030
By Lemma Four, the desired
state cannot be reached from

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:26.450
the start state, because
its parity is odd,

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:27.750
using legal moves.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:28.420
So we're done.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.290
So the proof of the
theorem-- by now,

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.200
it's short, because we did four
lemmas, a corollary, and lots

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:34.790
of argument.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:43.010
Could you have solved the puzzle
if I allow the blank to be

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.680
somewhere else at the end?

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.250
Is the puzzle solvable then?

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.250
No.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.790
Why not?

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.105
Doesn't impact the parity at
all, so you can't do that.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.300
Again, the idea
here-- and you'll

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.850
get some practice
in homework-- is

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.140
you're looking for a property
that holds at the beginning,

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.400
is preserved by every
step, but is not

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.190
present in the target state.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.980
Now actually, this puzzle
was enormously popular

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.260
in the late 1880s.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:29.260
In fact there was $1,000
prize offered for anybody

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.640
who could solve
the larger version.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.310
Back then, it was the 15
puzzle, which you can still

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:37.740
buy today-- same problem
on a 4 by 4 grid--

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.150
exactly the same problem.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.470
A pair is out of order.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.430
You've got to get them in order.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.510
You can't do it.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:46.460
Now, the proof
you can't do it is

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:50.210
a little harder-- same
idea-- one extra idea

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.570
in it-- one extra lemma.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.080
And that's for homework.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.700
So you'll go through and
see exactly the structure

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.360
with one extra little trick it.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.177
But back then, I guess most
people didn't-- of course,

00:56:02.177 --> 00:56:04.010
most people didn't
realize it wasn't doable.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.250
So they could offer
this price safely.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:11.130
$1,000 then is probably worth a
quarter million dollars today.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.440
Any questions on
the eight puzzle?

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.624
Yeah.

00:56:15.624 --> 00:56:19.261
AUDIENCE: The
inductive steps-- when

00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:23.064
you said, "by inductive
hypothesis," [INAUDIBLE] parity

00:56:23.064 --> 00:56:27.465
after, shouldn't the
first term be M0?

00:56:27.465 --> 00:56:28.340
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.250
No, the first move is M1.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.410
The second is M2.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:36.859
Now, when I talk
about zero moves,

00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:38.400
that means no moves
are taking place.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.970
I'm still in the start state.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.920
So a move is a transition
between states.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.160
So you could have state 0.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.556
That's the start state.

00:56:45.556 --> 00:56:49.685
State one would be the
move after move one.

00:56:49.685 --> 00:56:50.810
Have I got that right here?

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:56.550
So the inductive step, I need
to show P0 zero implies P1.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.070
P1 implies P2, and so forth.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.620
And P n is the parity of
inversions after n moves.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.670
So you could have state s0.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:12.835
We didn't label the states here,
but you could have state s0.

00:57:12.835 --> 00:57:13.817
Yeah.

00:57:13.817 --> 00:57:17.499
AUDIENCE: So in this problem,
we assume that everything should

00:57:17.499 --> 00:57:20.830
be defined as rows or columns.

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:25.454
How do we know when the
assumptions are valid?

00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:26.870
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:31.071
OK, so really,
there's two cases.

00:57:31.071 --> 00:57:32.570
To be really precise,
we should have

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:35.510
argued there's only two types of
moves, a row move and a column

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.037
move.

00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:38.620
And in fact, if you look at what
can move into a blank square,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.919
there's four guys that
can do it-- the guy above,

00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:43.460
the guy to the right, the guy
to the left, and the guy below.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.549
Two of those are row
moves, two are columns.

00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:47.590
So that's right-- to really
pin down the details,

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.696
we should have checked those
are the only two possible moves.

00:57:50.696 --> 00:57:53.320
And if there was a third kind of
move that I hadn't considered,

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.860
this proof would be bogus.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.290
That's a good question.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.141
Any other questions?

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.880
OK.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.142
Now, I think
probably, you see why

00:58:07.142 --> 00:58:08.350
the invariants are important.

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:12.290
But say that someday,
you're building software

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.762
to run a nuclear reactor.

00:58:14.762 --> 00:58:16.470
Now, there's a certain
state you'd really

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:19.530
like to avoid-- meltdown.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.310
And you'd like to
be able to prove

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:25.220
that, in any sequence of moves
that happen in your reactor

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.800
program, you never reach
the meltdown state.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.160
Well you'd use
invariants to do that.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.950
Or if you're building
software for an airplane,

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.400
you'd like to never
reach the crash state.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.860
Or if you're building
a radiation device,

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.330
you never want to get in the
state that fries the patient.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:48.425
So this is an important notion.

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:49.800
So for the rest
of the day, we're

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.470
going to talk about a
different kind of induction

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:55.390
called strong induction.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.020
It's very similar to
ordinary induction,

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:02.970
but it's a little easier to use
when solving certain problems.

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.820
Now like regular
induction, strong induction

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.908
can be expressed with an axiom.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.594
So let me show you the
strong induction axiom.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.420
You have a predicate,
P n, like before.

00:59:54.570 --> 01:00:04.840
If P0 is true-- your base
case-- and for all n,

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.330
it's not P n implies P
n plus 1, it's P0 and P1

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:19.430
and dot, dot, dot, and P n
are all true, then P n plus 1.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:29.242
If this is true for all n,
then P n is true for all n.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:41.470
Now, the only difference
between strong induction

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:46.380
and ordinary induction that
we did last time is this part.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.220
In ordinary induction,
you're showing

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.830
that P n implies P n plus 1.

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.360
In strong induction, you're
showing that all these facts

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.880
put together imply P n plus 1.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.810
Now, to show
implication, remember,

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:08.234
you get to assume that
all these things are true.

01:01:08.234 --> 01:01:10.150
So you know how in
ordinary induction, we say,

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:13.890
"assume P n is true and you're
going to prove P n plus 1?"

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.440
In strong induction, you get
to say, "assume P n is true,

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.070
P n minus 1 is true, dot,
dot, dot, P1 is true,

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.840
and P0 is true.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.650
You get to assume a lot more.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:26.810
So it's a stronger
proof technique,

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:30.520
because it allows you to do
more-- or so you would think.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.162
Now in fact, any proof you
can do with strong induction,

01:01:34.162 --> 01:01:35.620
you can do with
ordinary induction.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.990
It just might be harder.

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.600
So you can't prove
any more with it,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.300
but it makes your
proofs much easier.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.133
And we're going to do
an example in a minute

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.320
where the proof is
much easier by getting

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.330
to assume all of these
things are true in order

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.880
to prove P n plus 1.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.990
Are there any questions
about the difference here

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.150
with strong induction-- that
now you get to assume all these

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:01.910
are true as part of
the inductive step?

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:02.410
All right.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.410
Our first example of
a strong induction

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.210
is going to be a simple game.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:13.380
We've got a stack of
eight blocks here.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.680
Now, in this game,
what you're going to do

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.490
is divide the stack
into two sub-stacks.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.470
So I just took eight, and
split it into three and five.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:30.390
For that move, you get
15 points-- 3 times 5.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.490
Let's write that down.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.450
OK, so this is called
the Unstacking Game.

01:02:54.810 --> 01:03:02.140
And in the first move, we
went 8 split to 5 and 3.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.940
And that's worth 15 points.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:12.100
Now in the next move, I'm going
to split the stack of five

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.160
into four and one.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.760
And for that, you get
4 points-- 4 times 1.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:26.610
And I keep on going until I
have a stacks of height one.

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.270
And the last move, I'll be
splitting a two into two ones.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.810
That'll give me one point.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:35.080
Then I add up all the points,
and that's your score.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.630
And the goal is to get
the most number of points

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.200
when you add up
the entire score.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.730
Now, just so this game is
clear, we're going to play it.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.049
And I'm going to
raise the stakes here.

01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:49.590
What we're going to
do is we're going

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:51.980
to have a competition
between three members

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.610
of the class and the TAs.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:04:00.020
Now, if the class team
wins-- they get more points--

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.720
we're going to give
everybody in the class candy.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.340
And I've got lots of candy here.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.668
If the TAs beat you,
they get the candy.

01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:11.610
AUDIENCE: What if it's a tie?

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.679
PROFESSOR: We'll
figure that out.

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:14.720
We'll come to that later.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.140
But you want to win this thing.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.216
So I need some
volunteers from the class

01:04:18.216 --> 01:04:19.340
who think they can do well.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.030
Yeah, come on down.

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.740
You two guys come on down.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.000
All right, TAs come on up.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.760
Now, I want you
to make some noise

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.796
if you think your three class
reps here can beat the TAs.

01:04:35.796 --> 01:04:38.102
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:40.970
All right, how many
people-- make some noise you

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.540
think the TAs are going to win.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.212
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.420
PROFESSOR: Ooh, that's nasty.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.180
It must've been a rough
recitation last week

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.930
on Wednesday.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.884
All right, so let's see.

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:52.800
I think we're going to
let the class go first.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.160
This is your stack.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.270
Now think about what move
you want to make first,

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:57.750
because that matters.

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.630
And you guys can give them
some advice if you want,

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.887
as to the move they
should make first.

01:05:02.887 --> 01:05:04.470
And I'm going to
keep score over here.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.070
Oh, OK, they went
for the maximum move.

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:11.580
That's good.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:16.160
They realized 4 times
4 is 16-- very good.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.705
So let's write that up here.

01:05:19.705 --> 01:05:23.380
You're Off to a good start.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.370
In fact, that's the
maximum number of points

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:28.720
for the first move,
I think-- good job.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.490
All right, so here's
the class here.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.640
And here are the TAs.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:48.135
And the class went 8 into
4 by 4, and they got 16.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:55.340
Now, the TAs are working
hard here, as you can see.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.890
And they've got a move.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:59.910
That's a pretty pathetic
first move for the TAs.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:03.230
Looking good for the
candy for you guys.

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.980
They got 7 points for the TAs.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.672
Class, what would you like
to do for your next move?

01:06:09.672 --> 01:06:10.588

Oh, no, no, one at a time.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.990
No, just one.

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.866
One stack gets
split-- either one.

01:06:33.866 --> 01:06:35.540

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.200
PROFESSOR: There you go.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.668
Oh, well, what do you do now?

01:06:39.668 --> 01:06:42.656
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:06:42.656 --> 01:06:45.146
AUDIENCE: Their strategy's
obviously better than ours.

01:06:45.146 --> 01:06:46.142
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but we've
figured it out already.

01:06:46.142 --> 01:06:46.640
AUDIENCE: We're going to lose.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.931
PROFESSOR: The TAs are
convinced they're going to lose.

01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:52.279
Three and one, OK,
good, interesting.

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:53.320
So we have three and one.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.110
That gives you 3 points.

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.000
All right, TAs, we need a move.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:08.000
All right, so they've gone
six and one-- 6 points.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.330
Class, you think
you're dead already?

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:17.130
So you've gotten three
and one now, again, for 3.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.160
So you're up to 22.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.570
You're way ahead-- 22 to 13.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.307
All right, TAs.

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:24.890
They look a little
disorganized to me.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:25.694
What do you think?

01:07:25.694 --> 01:07:26.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:31.315
PROFESSOR: Another one--
you can tell where they're

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:32.970
headed here-- five and one.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:33.792
They have 5 points.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:34.500
They're up to 18.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.300
They're 4 behind you.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.146
All right, class.

01:07:39.146 --> 01:07:43.640
All right, you got 2 points.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:53.290
TAs-- you really think they
know how to do this best?

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:53.854
I don't know.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.890
PROFESSOR: Oh, big
change in strategy there.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.520
All that thinking, and
that's what we got.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.371
OK, 4 points.

01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:13.870
Class.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.939
All right, they
pick up 2 more here.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:27.620
The three just got split into
two and one for 2 points.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.370
How are you doing?

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.729
You've got 19, 22, 24, up to 26.

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:37.010
13, 18, 22-- you're
still doing good.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.180
TAs are behind.

Let's see what they've
got up their sleeves here.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.950
All right, they definitely
have a strategy going here.

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:49.109
That's 3 points.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:53.029
Ooh, there's not much
option left for you guys.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:53.851
Yeah.

PROFESSOR: No, no,
no, that'll be a 0.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.200
All right, that gave
you a point-- two

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.580
went to one and one-- 1 point.

Not a lot of choice for
you guys either, I guess.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.418
There's only one way
to split that stack.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:22.010
All right, 2 points,
and your final move

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.979
for the class and all the candy.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:29.132
You get 1 more point.

You've got 22, 24, 26, 27, 28.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.700
And the TAs are going to get
one last move for the TAs.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:44.339

got 2, 1, 1, 2.

You already tied them.

behind and tied you.

but then they caught up.

Now, your class reps had an
interesting thought here.

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.325
They ask, is it possible
that any strategy gives 28?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.590
Hmm.

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:51.110
I wouldn't do that
to you, would I?

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:53.082

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.670
Yeah, probably.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:57.545
Any ideas?

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.110
Can you beat 28?

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:02.520
They're already
eating the candy.

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:10.370
In fact, you can't beat 28.

And you can't do
worse than 28, either.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.399
Because every strategy gives 28.

01:11:14.399 --> 01:11:16.690

have to throw it to the class

to vote who should
get the candy.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.590
try to prove this theorem.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:21.830
So the theorem is that all
strategies for the n-block game

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.460
produce the same score.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.765
It wasn't a coincidence for 8.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.070
And the score, we'll call it
S of n for the n-block game.

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:41.420
So for example, we're trying
to show that S of 8 was 28.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.380
So what strategy
do you think we're

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.505
going to use for the proof?

01:13:49.146 --> 01:13:50.270
AUDIENCE: Strong induction.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.784
PROFESSOR: Strong
induction-- so you

01:13:51.784 --> 01:13:53.950
want to write that down--
proof by strong induction.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:07.430
What's the next step in a
proof by any kind of induction?

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:08.650
AUDIENCE: Base case.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.230
PROFESSOR: Base case-- not yet.

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.230
AUDIENCE: The predicate.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.880
PROFESSOR: The predicate--
what's the predicate here?

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.460
All right, so for the
inductive hypothesis,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.118
the predicate-- any guesses as
to what P of n is going to be?

01:14:24.118 --> 01:14:26.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:27.288
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:31.070
AUDIENCE: n should
be 2n minus 1 by 2.

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's part of it,

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.680
but we're going to use this
as a predicate to start with.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.882
You've gone a step ahead there.

01:14:38.882 --> 01:14:41.090
So I'm going to start with
this as being a predicate,

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.150
because I'm trying to
show they're all the same.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.400
And I haven't figured out
what the scores going to be.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.970
But I think you're already
on a good track here for what

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:50.410
the score is going to be.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:51.948
Now we do the base case.

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:02.770
So we take n equals
1-- the one-block game.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.130
S of 1 is 0.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:06.170
We never took a move.

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:07.080
We never got a score.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.150
There was only one block.

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:10.560
We ended before we started.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.680
So that's OK.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.235
And now we have
the inductive step.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:29.510
And here we get to assume P1,
P2, all the way up to P n,

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:31.610
to prove P n plus 1.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:41.791
And so now we look
at n plus 1 blocks,

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:43.040
because that's we're starting.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.890
So we have n plus 1,
and we split it somehow.

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:53.500
And it could be any split.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.700
We might have K on one
side, then n plus 1 minus K

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.727
on the other side for
any K between 1 and n.

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:08.660
And let's figure out our
score for that scenario.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.170
Well, we get the
product of these numbers

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.060
for the first step.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:24.100
We get K times n plus 1
minus K for the first step.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.750
And then as we recurse,
and we split up

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.300
that block of K blocks,
how many points do we

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.030
get for splitting
that all the way down?

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.900
AUDIENCE: P of K.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.191
PROFESSOR: P of K, because
that's the induction.

01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:39.315
We assume that as part of
the induction hypothesis.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.080
And how many points do
we get for splitting

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.260
this stack all the way down?

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:55.590
Yeah, P of n plus 1 minus K.

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.330
And you see why
strong induction's

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.310
coming in handy here?

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:02.990
For the TA's strategy,
K would be 1.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.099
We know P of 1 is 0.

01:17:05.099 --> 01:17:06.890
And you would just need
ordinary induction.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.760
This would be P of n.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.300
But for a general strategy,
it could be any split.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.110
So we need to have all
these assumed here.

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:18.330
It makes it much easier
when using strong induction.

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:20.310
All right, so this
is our total score

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:23.180
for the game for
n plus 1 blocks.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.240
And we're trying to show
it just depends on n,

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.149
and that it doesn't depend
on K. Does that depend on K?

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.210
Looks like it to me, right?

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:44.020
I got K in every single term.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:44.740
So I'm not there.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.240
I'm stuck.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.939
You see why I'm stuck?

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:51.230
Because I'd like to be able
to say that the score I get

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:54.120
for the n plus one
block game-- this

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.520
is S n plus 1-- is the same
for any sequence of moves.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.260
It doesn't even depend on
K. But I can't do that.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.310
What do you do when you're
stuck with an induction proof?

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.460
What's one of the tricks?

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:07.584
AUDIENCE: Make it stronger.

01:18:07.584 --> 01:18:09.800
PROFESSOR: Make
it stronger, which

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.360
means I get a stronger
induction hypothesis.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.030
Now, somebody gave me
one up there before.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:19.196
How could I strengthen my
induction hypothesis here?

01:18:22.052 --> 01:18:23.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.320
PROFESSOR: Give the
formula for S n-- that

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.360
would make it stronger.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.140
I tell you what it is.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.760
What's a good guess
for the formula here?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.700
AUDIENCE: Factorial.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:41.580
PROFESSOR: Factorial-- Well,
is S of 8 equal 8 factorial?

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.234
No, not so good.

01:18:44.234 --> 01:18:46.631
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:48.130
AUDIENCE: n equals
n minus 1 over 2.

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:51.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a better guess--

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:56.160
equals n times n minus 1 over 2.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.750
And in fact, what's
8 times 7 over 2?

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.330
It's 28.

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:01.770
It works here.

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:02.770
Let's check another one.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.520
What's S of 2?

01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:07.670
AUDIENCE: 1.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:12.740
PROFESSOR: 1-- well, 2
times 1 over 2-- it works.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.690
What's S of 3?

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.130
2 the first move, then 1 more.

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:26.340
3-- 3 times 2 over
2 is 3-- looks good.

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.430
So now I've got a stronger
induction hypothesis.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.220
Not only is it
always the same, it

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.710
is that number is your score.

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.190
Let's see if that works.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:38.000
Let's plug that in now.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.560
So base case--
let's check it out--

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:47.520
is 1 times 1 minus
1 over 2 equal to 0.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.750
Yes.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:53.040
Let's plug it in here now.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.570
P of K would be now
K, K minus 1 over 2.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:08.220
This would be n plus 1 minus K,
n minus K over 2 plus this one

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.720
here.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.850
All right, I've got to add
all these things up, and see

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:19.473
if it equals that
expression for n plus 1.

01:20:19.473 --> 01:20:20.435
Let's do that.

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:29.780
All right, I get 2 K n
plus 2 K minus 2 K squared.

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.920
I'm putting all this over 2--
one giant mess over 2 here--

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:43.120
plus K squared minus
K plus n squared.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:52.940
Well, let's write it just as
n plus 1 times n, minus K n,

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.860
minus K, minus K n, all over 2.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.770
And now let's cancel.

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:04.420
Two K n's here cancel K n, K n.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:12.310
2K cancels K and K. 2K
squared minus 2 K squared

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:14.070
cancels K squared.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:20.970
And I forgot, plus K
squared from here and here.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:25.040
So I'm left with n
plus 1 times n over 2.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.450
That is S n plus 1.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.770
And the K disappears.

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:34.740
We've established, now, the
stronger induction hypothesis.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.980
So not only did we prove
that every set of unstackings

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:40.960
gives you the same score.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.010
We proved the score is, for
n blocks, n times n minus 1

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.570
over 2.

01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:51.620
That's was pretty good
for strong induction.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.710
It lets you do some
pretty powerful things.

01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:56.820
OK, very good,
that's it for today.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.670
PROFESSOR: Any questions before
I obliterate all this

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.920
lovely geometry?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.120
No.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.410
OK.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.910
We handled them during
intermission I guess.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.370
Let me do a couple more plane
groups just very quickly to

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.330
show you how they come out
without going through all of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.900
the steps, because I think we've
seen now what one has to

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.520
do to derive these.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.050
There are two that are left.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.140
One is a threefold axis, and
if that's all the symmetry

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.210
we've put into the lattice,
we're combining a threefold

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.030
rotation axis with a primitive
lattice, and we know that this

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.310
has to be hexagonal net.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.490
Because from our depth of
experience, we know that is

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.020
the shape of a lattice that is
demanded by a threefold axis.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.750
It has two translations, T1,
that are identical in length.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.940
And this angle between them
is exactly 120 degrees.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.480
That's what we saw a threefold
access require.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.100
So now what we are doing is
putting in a threefold axis at

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.950
one lattice point, and this
means we are adding the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.330
operations A 2 pi over 3.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.170
A minus 2 pi over 3.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.600
I'll choose to define a 120
degree rotation that way, and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.215
the operation A 2 pi, which is
the identity operations.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:42.660
So I'm adding three
operations.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.990
Putting the threefold axis in
at all these locations.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.000
They will all be translationally
equivalent.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.820
The pattern of this particular
plane group is going to be the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.290
pattern of a threefold axis.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.560
And so there will be one motif
here, 120 degrees away.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.500
There will be a--

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.360
sorry to wipe out those
operations--

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.570
120 degrees.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.430
There'll be another object
located here.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.870
And 120 degrees again,
there will be another

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.210
object located here.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.770
So these guys will fall
at the corner of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.070
an equilateral triangle.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.320
And the same will be at the
other corners of the net, and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.600
that, as I've said before,
is the pattern

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.760
of that plane group.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.440
And that's a plane group
that we would call P3.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.880
Primitive lattice that has to
be hexagonal, and what we've

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.560
added to it is a
threefold axis.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.870
OK, let me down here just
indicate the combinations that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.480
we would do.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.900
And I could do it up on top,
but I can work with this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.210
translation as well, which is
easier to reach at this late

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.650
hour in the afternoon.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.790
Let me combine A 2 pi over 3
with this translation here.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.060
And that says we have to get
an operation B 2 pi over 3.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.880
That is located at the original
translation T times

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.820
the cotangent of 1/2
of 2 pi over 3.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.670
And that's at 1/2 of the
cotangent of 60 degrees.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.640
And this turns out not to be any
nice neat number like 0 or

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.000
1/2, but if you evaluate what
the distance up along the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.880
perpendicular bisector is by
this amount, where you come

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.820
out is right in the center
of this triangle.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.890
Trust me.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.000
A little bit of trigonometry
will let you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.090
convince yourself of that.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.760
So if I rotate 120 degrees.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.620
Bring this one to this one,
and then translate over to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.959
here, the way the first one and
the second one are related

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.020
is by a 120 degree rotation
about the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.270
center of this triangle.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.330
If I combine the operation A
minus 2 pi over 3, with this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.740
translation, I go down a
distance x of minus this

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.420
amount and that puts me in the
middle of the triangle that is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.250
directly below.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.370
And I can move that back up.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.320
And now I have all the
operations of a threefold axis

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.660
about this location.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.730
I can do the same thing with the
threefold axis at another

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.160
lattice point.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.830
Another thing I could
do is to just

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.560
rotate this by 120 degrees.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.260
And by either route, you
find there must be a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.560
threefold axis here.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.680
Notice that these threefold
axes will once again, as

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.490
advertised, simply take things
that are at the different

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.210
corners of the cell.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.590
For example, this threefold axis
will tell you how this

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.700
motif is related to this one
is related to this one.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.130
And so it goes through the other
threefold axes as well.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.020
This threefold axis will tell
you this one is related.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.020
No, I don't want
to draw it in.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.500
So this is P3, a pair of
threefold axes in the centers

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.120
of the triangle, and another one
at the corner of the cell.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.030
And now I am going to do the
remaining combination of a

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.580
rotation axis with a lattice, so
quickly, and it's going to

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.650
take your breath away.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.480
And that is seemingly the
most difficult and

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.170
complex one of all.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.490
This would be P6.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.860
Sixfold axis plus a
primitive lattice.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.010
And we know it also has
to be hexagonal.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.950
And that will be called P6.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.970
What we're adding to the lattice
is a sixfold axis.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.490
And now what I'm going to do
as a shortcut is to say a

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.340
sixfold axis also contains
all the operations

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.730
of a threefold axis.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.150
So I can take P3 and drop it
right on top of P6, and that's

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.980
going to give me threefold
axes here.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.320
Sixfold axis not only contains
2 pi over 6 and 2 pi over 3,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.230
it also contains the operation
2 pi over 2.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.460
This is the operation of a
twofold axis, and that says I

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.150
have to, in addition to the two
full rotation that sits

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.730
here get twofold rotations in
the middle of every one of the

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.830
translations T2.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.555
So actually, this is going to
be P2 superimposed on P3.

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:22.750
And that's going to give me
these twofold axis and this

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.700
threefold axis.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.520
And the only thing I have to do
is to show you what A 2 pi

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.120
over 6 combined with
one of these

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.330
translations is going to do.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.350
What is A 2 pi over 6 combined
with this translation?

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.850
And it's going to be new
operation B 2 pi over 6, and

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:49.990
it's going to be located at 1/2
of T times the cotangent

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.400
of 1/2 of 60 degrees, cotangent
of 30 degrees.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:03.640
And the cotangent of
30 degrees is 2.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.800
So this is going
to be at 1/2--

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.720
no, what do I want to say?

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.260
This is 30 degrees.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.030
This is one.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.430
This is two.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.080
Cotangent of 30 degrees is this
over this, and that is--

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.610
no that's one.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.020
AUDIENCE: It's 2 pi
[? squared 3. ?]

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.180
OK, that's right.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.039
So actually, what that does is
to say the sixfold axis sits

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.390
right up here.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.260
So I don't get any new sixfold
axis rotation of 60 degrees

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.100
here, followed by translation
is the same as 60 degrees

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.770
about here.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:51.430
So this is P6, and there is a
lot of pure rotation axes

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.560
combined with lattices.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.240
We've got P1, P2,
P3, P4, and P6.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.770
Now, what I will do eventually,
when we're all

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:15.990
done here, the plane groups are
not derived in any book or

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.650
set of tables that
I am aware of.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.830
And next time, you will get
some notes that do this in

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.450
very slow motion fashion
and give you all

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.510
the individual steps.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.120
But the international tables
does give you diagrams of the

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.160
resulting plane groups, very
nice carefully done figures

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.830
along with the representative
arrangement of motifs that

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.160
they generate.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.620
But we're not done yet.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.800
We have not let mirror planes
enter the picture.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.790
And so unless there is
dissension or debate, I'd like

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.350
to consider what happens when we
take a mirror plane, and we

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.450
can combine that with two
different kinds of lattices, a

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:12.620
primitive rectangular net or
a centered rectangular net,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:21.250
which is called C. And in order
to do that, we need yet

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.340
another combination theorem.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:36.280
Here are the lattice points,
and let me first derive the

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.860
plane group that is called PM.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.040
And what I'll do
is to put the--

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.050
let me use a squiggly line here,
not because I'm excited

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.740
or nervous about this, but just
to distinguish it from

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.240
the edges of the cell.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.760
So here is the operation
sigma.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.080
The pattern that is going to
be displayed by the plane

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.670
group is once again just the
pattern produced by a mirror

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.460
plane hung at every
lattice point.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.520
But now we need a theorem.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.320
What we have here is the
operation of reflection,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.600
followed by a translation that
is perpendicular to the locus

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.330
of the reflection line.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.700
And we will ask what is that?

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.580
Again, you get the answer by
just looking at once and for

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.050
all, and say, if here is
a first one and it is

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.020
right-handed, and I reflect it
to one number to a second one,

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.630
number two, which is
left-handed, and then move

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.390
that by translation here to get
number three, which stays

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.120
left-handed if I move
by translation.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.160
And ask now how was one
related to three.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.050
The chirality is changed.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.970
Reflection is the only thing
available to us, and lo and

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.250
behold, if I say there is a new
mirror plane here, that

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.800
tells me how this is related
to this, and this one is

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.890
related to this one.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:15.270
And this to this and this to
this, so the answer to this

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.780
question is that a reflection
combined with a perpendicular

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.850
translation is a new reflection
operation sigma

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:27.690
prime that is located at a
distance removed from the

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:33.230
first by 1/2 of that
perpendicular translation.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.530
And again, it's a plane old
mirror plane just like the

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.950
first one, but notice that the
disposition of objects

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.230
relative to the mirror plane in
the center of the cell is

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.530
quite distinct from the
disposition of objects

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.000
relative to the first mirror
plane, so this is a second

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.960
mirror plane.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.220
It is an independent mirror
plane from the first.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.710
So that is plane group PM.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.360
If there's symmetry in this
business, you might ask is

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.080
there a plane group AM?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.180
The answer is yes in
three dimensions.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.070
There is a space group, PM, and
there's a space group AM.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.960
So there's AM and PM, and there
is symmetry, and all is

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.210
well in the universe.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.380
OK, we're making great
progress here.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:30.540
And we'll be fairly well along
before we have to bring things

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.230
to a close.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.490
Let's do the second addition
that's possible

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.440
with a mirror plane.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.120
And that is to take a reflection
operation and add

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.360
it to the translations that
are present in a centered

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.610
rectangular net.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.560
We've already done all the work
for PM, so we can use

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.410
that as a starting point.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.880
The pattern of this plane group
is going to look like a

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.510
pair of objects related
by reflection.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.850
But now, we'll have an extra
pair hung at the centered

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.100
lattice point as well.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.230
And the first thing we can note
is that this mirror plane

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.980
is no longer independent
of the first one.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.990
What goes on at this mirror
plane is something that's

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.490
related to what happens at the
origin lattice point and

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.630
mirror plane, and therefore,
these two mirror planes are

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.670
going to do the same thing.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:48.660
The pattern of this plane group,
we've taken a mirror

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.800
plane and added it to a centered
rectangular net.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.540
This is called a C lattice,
standing for centered.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.850
And correspondingly,
the symbol for this

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.100
plane group is CM.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.710
We know how this one is
related to this one.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.440
This one related to this one.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.700
And now, we've got something
of a problem.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.670
All of these motifs
are equivalent.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.140
How is this one related
to this one?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.890
Or in more general terms, what
we're asking is suppose I have

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.900
a reflection operation sigma,
and I add the translation not

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:44.290
at right angles to it, as I
did here, but place the

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.050
translation at an angle
with respect to

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.150
the reflection plane.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.870
So what we're going to do is to
take a first motif that's

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.460
right-handed, reflect it to
a second one, which is

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.790
left-handed.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.150
And then slide it along so that
it sits up in the same

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.820
position relative to this
centered lattice point.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.580
So here's number three,
translation leaves it

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.830
left-handed.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:22.020
So I've taken the operation of
reflection combined it with a

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.540
translation that has a
perpendicular component plus a

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.950
parallel component,
perpendicular and parallel

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.220
meaning the orientation of these
two components of the

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:39.140
translation relative to the
reflection operation.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.630
Anybody want to hazard a guess
on how that first one is

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.420
related to the third one?

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.630
Number one is right-handed.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.710
Number two is left-handed,
so it's got to

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.960
be reflection, right?

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.430
If I put a reflection plane in
here, this one ought to be

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.140
tilted like this.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.960
That's not going
to do the job.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.910
Anybody got any idea?

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.356
Yeah.

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:10.589
AUDIENCE: What is that,
T, T1 [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:10.939
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:13.869
T parallel plus T perpendicular
means it's a

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.780
component of this translation.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.900
This is T. This has a part T
perpendicular, and it has a

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.562
part T parallel relative to
the initial mirror plane.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.930
My friends, we have just
stumbled headlong over a new

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.910
type of symmetry operation,
which we have discovered upon

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.520
making this combination
of mirror plane

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.320
with a centered lattice.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.900
And it's come up to smack us
rudely in the face even though

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.850
we may not have been
clever enough to

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.920
think of it in advance.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.930
This is a new type of operation,
and it is an

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.760
operation that cannot be reduced
to one of the simple

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.140
operations that we've
defined so far.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.050
You've got to take two steps
to get from number one to

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.600
number three.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.350
The way you can do it is to
reflect along a locus that is

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.000
one half of the way along the
perpendicular part of the

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.620
translation, exactly the same
location as we found the

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.660
symmetry plane positioned when
the translation was normal to

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.460
the first mirror plane.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.330
But yet we can't put the
object down yet in the

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.420
position that would be produced
by translation,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.150
because our translation is
inclined to the mirror plane.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.470
So I've got to take
a second step.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.340
Reflect.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.900
Don't yet put it down yet.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.990
Before you put it down, slide
it up parallel to the mirror

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.710
plane by an amount that's
equal to the part of the

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.940
translation that is parallel
to the mirror plane.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.690
So to summarize this before
all these words get too

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.300
confusing, I'm saying that a
reflection operation combined

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.900
with a general translation
that has a perpendicular

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.590
component in the parallel
component relative to the

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.550
locus of reflection is going to
be a new operation, which

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.150
I'll write as sigma tau,
a reflection part and a

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.630
translation tau that is parallel
to the mirror plane,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.690
and tau is equal to the part
of the translation that is

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.580
parallel to the mirror plane.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.340
Astounding.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.670
This is a two-step operation
that cannot be described in

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.040
terms simpler than saying
do two steps to do it.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.510
And we'll see as we go along,
particularly into a

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.310
three-dimensional space, that
there are other two-step

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.610
operations as well.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.520
Now you're all familiar with a
pattern like this, because in

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.810
very short order when New
England's winter descends upon

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.930
us, as you go slogging along
from your room into the

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.080
Institute, your footprints will
make a pattern like that

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.330
in the snow.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.280
Exactly what we've got here.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.110
Reflect across and slide.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.500
Reflect across and slide.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.250
Reflect across and slide,
and this is the

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.250
glide component tau.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.620
And this is an operation that
is called a glide plane.

00:20:36.742 --> 00:20:39.490
And it's a new type of
symmetry operation.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.790
It can only exist in a
pattern, which has

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.600
translational periodicity.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.200
And if we were not clever enough
to invent it, we would

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.370
see it as soon as we combined a
mirror plane with a lattice

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.340
that was non-primitive and had
a translation parallel to it.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.810
So it's a very, very
descriptive

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.900
name, the glide plane.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.990
Reflect and glide, reflect and
glide, reflect and glide.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.530
It sounds like something you'd
be doing in the Arthur Murray

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.500
dance studio, very melodious.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.430
Reflect and glide, reflect
and glide.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.680
It's a nice operation.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:24.470
All right, so what has happened
then when we add a

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:29.320
mirror plane to a centered
rectangular net is that we get

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.880
a new operation coming in,
something completely new.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.440
We've got a symbol to represent
an individual

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.350
operation, sigma the symbol
for reflection with a

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.670
subscript tau.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:50.550
And the pattern we've already
drawn, but let's do it again

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.670
in a tidy fashion.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.820
Exactly as advertised, the pair
of objects related by

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.020
reflection hung at every
lattice point of-- holy

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.610
mackerel, look at this.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.450
That would give you
the willies.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.340
That's the nature
of the motif.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.210
Get that out of there.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.175
Mirror planes going through
the lattice points.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.460
Glide planes halfway
in between.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:25.180
The mirror lines and the glide
planes tell us how things on

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.400
the right side, for example,
of the lattice point are

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.450
related to the motif of opposite
chirality on the

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.625
left-hand side of the centered
lattice point.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.290
And this is a plane group
that is called CM.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.540
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.440
PROFESSOR: Yes, sir.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.179
AUDIENCE: How can we just define
a new operation that's

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:01.926
a two-step.

00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:04.914
Seems like we could do this
forever, define two steps of

00:23:04.914 --> 00:23:07.260
any new operation, like you
said, with two steps.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.200
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.330
We found this, because we
tripped headlong over it.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.310
And we say OK, there it is.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.510
We've got to deal with it.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.200
But you're right.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.190
How do you know that rotating
once reflecting, and then

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.860
turning end over end three times
is not a new operation

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.310
that cannot be decomposed, is
the word that's used for it,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.240
into something simpler?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.630
The answer is you've
got to try it.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.810
If they're there, when we make
these combinations of a

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.240
symmetry operation, and now the
symmetry operation can be

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.090
a two-step symmetry operation,
now that we've discovered

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.190
that, combine that with lattice
and with rotation and

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.320
with reflection, and ask what
is the relation between the

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.760
motif at the beginning and
the motif at the end.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.230
If you can't describe it any
more simply other than a hop,

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.590
skip and jump, you've got to
introduce the hop, skip, and

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.420
jump as an element that
goes into the

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.150
derivation of these groups.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.830
Now before you get concerned and
fill out an add/drop card,

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.100
I have to reassure you that
there are a couple of two-step

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.800
operations that we have yet to
discover, but there are no

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.710
three-step operations
that are necessary.

00:24:23.686 --> 00:24:24.590
Whew.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.574
Feel better now, don't you?

00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:28.035
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
say it's kind of arbitrary,

00:24:28.035 --> 00:24:30.957
because you have a and b, you're
just applying the third

00:24:30.957 --> 00:24:31.444
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.444 --> 00:24:35.840
T sub a and b, [INAUDIBLE]
trivial multiplication tables.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.650
PROFESSOR: Well, actually,
this is

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.540
something that is distinct.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.710
I mean here is the group, and
you cannot describe the

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.200
relation between everything that
is in this pattern, which

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.350
was obtained simply by taking
the operation of reflection--

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.060
we know how to peacefully
coexist with that--

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:58.180
and placing that pair of objects
at lattice point of a

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.430
centered rectangular net.

00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:04.360
So that's nothing
really freaky.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.430
I mean it's a straightforward
addition, but if it's a group,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.650
you have to know when you
combine all the operations

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.490
pairwise that it'd be able to
show that these operations are

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.820
members of a group.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.560
And the answer in terms of the
language of group theory, if

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.770
you combine a reflection with
a translation that has a

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.420
component that is parallel to
the reflection plane, then

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.970
there is a new operation that
comes up that has to be in the

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.660
group multiplication table,
and the operation has a

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.910
reflection part and a
translation part.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.100
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.700
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.785
AUDIENCE: How do we go from the
lower left to the upper

00:25:42.785 --> 00:25:44.630
right in one operation?

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.350
PROFESSOR: The lower left
to the upper right.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.670
AUDIENCE: No, the upper
right diagonally.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:57.116
Across the diagonal, the upper
right corner of the square.

00:25:57.116 --> 00:25:58.532
PROFESSOR: Upper right here?

00:25:58.532 --> 00:25:59.948
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:01.943
And the left-handed
guide below that.

00:26:01.943 --> 00:26:03.470
PROFESSOR: The left-handed
guide below.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.220
AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.090
Down there.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.272
PROFESSOR: Where
is down there?

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:08.565
AUDIENCE: The lowest
edge of the--

00:26:08.565 --> 00:26:09.430
PROFESSOR: Down here?

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.210
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.655
From this one to this one?

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.905
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.350
What I can say is--

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.670
may sound like I'm slipping
off the hook too easily--

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.150
we said that we really only want
to consider operations

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.030
that terminate within the cell,
and the way I get from

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:42.430
here to here is to reflect and
then translate up by the

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.670
diagonal translation.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.950
So that's something that
lies outside the cell.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.470
So I can always knock off
an integral number of

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.470
translations or add on
an integral number of

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:58.026
translations to any mapping
transformation, modulo T. OK?

00:26:58.026 --> 00:26:59.994
AUDIENCE: But surely, if you've
done, one operation

00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:02.460
then it's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.383
PROFESSOR: From here to here?

00:27:03.383 --> 00:27:04.940
No, not necessarily.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.840
If I give you a very simple
pattern and plane group P1,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.310
and you ask how do I get from
this one here to this one that

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:20.175
sits up here?

00:27:20.175 --> 00:27:24.150
If it's outside the cell, I've
got to go translation that's

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:24.940
outside the cell.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.770
But it's not any new
translation or

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.000
any new sort of operation.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.300
This is sort of in the
same category.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.030
Yeah.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.950
AUDIENCE: You can make
a glide plane in the

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.970
center of the cell.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.510
Thank you.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:45.500
There is a glide operation that
goes from here to here

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.190
and then translates up by
one full translation.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.650
But a glide operation that
is an integral number of

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.990
translations says that
you're dealing with--

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.720
there's another object that is
removed by a translation that

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.870
is the same thing.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.620
So it is first and that simpler
one that would be

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.570
inside of the cell and would
be only the unique sort of

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.630
translation you need
to consider.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.980
Thank you.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.020
That's a good question.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.720
That was a good answer
to his question.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.260
In fact, anybody want
to take over?

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.127
I didn't do well on that one.

00:28:18.127 --> 00:28:19.192
Yeah.

00:28:19.192 --> 00:28:20.174
AUDIENCE: I was curious.

00:28:20.174 --> 00:28:22.629
Does the glide plane exist maybe
in this case because

00:28:22.629 --> 00:28:25.084
we're not using a
primitive cell?

00:28:25.084 --> 00:28:29.020
If you were to consider this
[INAUDIBLE] as hexagonal?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.950
PROFESSOR: OK, let me answer
that question by saying that

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.370
that's our first encounter
with it.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.230
But now, that it exists, that
is a symmetry element, which

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:46.960
we should consider adding to
lattices in addition to pure

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.600
reflection.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.540
So let me proceed now to do
another plane group since we

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.766
had discovered the operation
of glide.

00:28:56.766 --> 00:29:06.060
And I will take a primitive
rectangular lattice, and I

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:11.565
will now add to the lattice
point, not a mirror plane, but

00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:13.136
a glide plane.

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.950
OK.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.740
The pattern is going to look
like the pattern of glide,

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.950
have things left and right
on either side

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.120
of the glide plane.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.370
The same thing here.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.700
And there is the pattern.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.502
This is a pattern that's
called PG.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:43.880
And what I have to ask is what
is the guide operation sigma

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.790
tau combined with, let's say
this translation T1.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:30:00.760
And the answer is that if I
reproduce number one to number

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.690
two of opposite chirality by the
glide operation sigma tau

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:13.980
and then follow that by T1 the
first and the third will be

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:19.590
related by a new glide operation
sigma tau prime

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.510
that's located at half
perpendicular part of the

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.180
translation away
from the first.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.800
And that really is a
generalization of this

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.910
relation here.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:38.270
If we make the pure reflection
operation a glide operation,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.390
combine it with a translation
that is perpendicular to it,

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.370
it turns out that the net
result is a new glide

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.290
operation, sigma tau prime.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:54.580
The two taus are equal, and this
occurs at one half of the

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.200
translation T perpendicular
removed from the first.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.660
And the complete generalization
would be to say

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.500
if I have a translation that
has a parallel part and a

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.540
perpendicular part relative to
the glide plane, what I will

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:18.950
get is a new glide operation
sigma prime that's located at

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.870
1/2 of the perpendicular part
of the translation from the

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.190
first, and it will pick up a
glide component that's equal

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:28.490
to the original tau plus the
part of the translation that's

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.190
parallel to the glide plane.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.820
So this now is this theorem
involving translation and

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.760
reflection type operations
in its most general form.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.330
OK.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:50.060
So this is a new group called
CM, and it consists of pairs

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.310
of objects.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.810
Sorry, we did that earlier.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.180
This is PG, pairs of objects
related by a glide plane, hung

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.940
at every lattice point of the
primitive rectangular lattice.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.372
Is there a CG?

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.900
Actually, there is not, and let
me show you why, and then

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.380
I think we're just about
quitting time.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.070
If there is a centered lattice,
and I hang a glide

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:31.610
plane at the lattice points,
we'll have glide planes in the

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:39.140
locations of PG, the pattern
will look like objects

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.390
repeated by glide.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.670
At this lattice point, and now
we're going to have another

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.540
object hung at the centered
lattice point, and it's going

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.520
to be in positions like this.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:33:00.560
Now, you can see just by looking
at the pattern that

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.290
there is going to be--

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.220
whoops, what did I do here?

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.900
I want to move this one up to
here, and I want to move this

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.380
one up to here.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.170
This one should be
in this location.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.240
If I look at that pattern, what
I've done is to create

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.790
halfway along the--

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.530
quarter of the way along
the translation a

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.990
pure reflection operation.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:35.190
And I can find that using
my general theorem.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:42.160
I have a glide operation,
sigma tau.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.500
I combine with that the centered
translation, which is

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.520
1/2 of T1 plus 1/2 of T2.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.200
I've taken 1/2 of T1 plus 1/2
of T2, that's the centering

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.846
translation, combined
that with sigma tau.

00:34:03.846 --> 00:34:07.060
I'll deftly jump to the side, so
the people against the wall

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.110
can see it.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.650
I've taken a glide operation,
combined it with this

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.260
translation.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:20.679
This should be a new reflection
type of operation

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.810
that will be located at 1/2 of
the perpendicular part of the

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:32.219
translation, and that's
at 1/2 of 1/2 of T1.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:37.219
And it will have a glide
component tau prime, which is

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:43.719
the original tau, which
was 1/2 of T2.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.130
And to that we add the
parallel part of the

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.110
translation, and that
is 1/2 of T2.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:55.510
So this is rewritten in slightly
different form, is

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:01.300
simply a new glide plane sigma
prime, which has a glide

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.620
component equal to the entire
translation T2 at

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.110
1/4 quarter of T1.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.200
And this is the same as a
mirror plane at 1/4 T1.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.030
And this, if we compare
it with CM, is

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.600
exactly the same thing.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:36.400
Identical to CM with an origin
shift of 1/4 T1.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.880
So there is no CG in what
we picked up in terms of

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:50.290
rectangular nets and symmetry
planes is PM, PG, and CN.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.510
So there are three groups
involving orthogonal nets in a

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.760
single symmetry plane.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:03.870
That is a good place
to wrap things up.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.120
And we'll next turn very, very
quickly equipped with a set of

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.240
notes, which summarizes the
result, to what happens when

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.600
we take two MM and put it into
a rectangular net, and take

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.900
two MM and put it into a
centered rectangular net.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.130
And then things get interesting,
because we've got

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:23.720
two planes.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.330
We can make a both
mirror planes.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.150
We can make them both glides, or
make one a mirror plane and

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.320
one a glide plane.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.110
So there are three possibilities
with the

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.880
addition of two MM to the net.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.850
More than enough for one day.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.330
It's Thursday.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.580
Take the rest of the
week and weekend

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.130
off by doing no symmetry.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.840
There's no assignment,
and we'll have at

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.090
it again next Tuesday.

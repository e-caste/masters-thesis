00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.960
ANDREW LO: What I want to
talk about is option pricing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.860
But given that there's
the midterm coming up,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.420
what I'd like to do
is to actually skip

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.766
the more technical part today.

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.140
Today, what I was
going to do was

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.060
to describe a method
for pricing options,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.350
a particular
option-pricing formula.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.520
Now, we have a course, 15.437,
on options and futures.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.340
And that's really what I would
recommend for those of you who

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.200
are interested in derivatives.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.780
But we really can't
let you leave MIT

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.720
without understanding a little
bit about the basics of option

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.680
pricing.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.500
And it's such a beautiful
argument that it's important,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.310
I think, for all of you
to see it at least once.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.190
But since I'd like you to focus
on it and really absorb it,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.410
and I suspect that most
of you are thinking

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.430
about the mid-term, I'd rather
postpone that till Monday,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.060
and then talk today about the
very basics of option payoff

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.280
diagrams, which is
relatively straightforward.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.490
And then give you a little bit
of a history of option pricing,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.070
and tell you a bit
about how it came about.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.060
And ultimately,
where the literature

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.220
fits within the grand
scheme of things.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.710
So last time, if you recall,
we talked about options

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.570
as insurance.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.270
And we went through a very
simple set of examples,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.150
where I described the
put option as really

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.810
being parallel to insurance in
all of these different terms.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.920
But the differences are that
a put option, first of all,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.810
can be used early.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.480
So you don't have to wait
until you have an accident

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.950
or wait until it expires.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.050
You can decide at
any point in time

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.130
that you want to exercise it.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.539
Also, unlike
insurance contracts,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.470
options can be bought and
sold in organized exchanges.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.690
So you can buy a put option.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.460
You can sell a put option.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.590
And then finally, dividends
have an impact on options.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.470
And so most options have
dividend protection,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.450
in the sense that if
there's a dividend paid,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.450
then the strike price will
be adjusted accordingly.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.170
Now, it's important
to understand

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.220
the differences between an
option and an underlying.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.180
Because they really have
some very, very important

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.560
distinctions, in terms
of their payoffs.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.190
So the way that we
try to emphasize that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.020
is by looking at a diagram
that graphs the option

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.310
value as a function of the
underlying parameters that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.270
influence the option.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.130
And the most important
parameter is, of course,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.540
the underlying price
of the stock or asset

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.640
on which the option is written.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.510
So this is an example
of a payoff diagram

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.280
that plots the value of
the option at maturity

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.060
for a call option on
an underlying stock.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.180
And the x-axis is the
price of the stock.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.300
And the y-axis is
the value or price

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.850
of the option on the date
of maturity or exercise.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.760
So let's suppose that the option
has a strike price of $20.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680
That gives the
holder of the option

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.030
the right to purchase the stock
for $20 at the maturity date.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.820
So it's a call option,
meaning it gives you the right

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.670
to call away or buy the stock.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.820
And the strike
price is set at $20.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.720
Now, if the actual price
of the stock is below $20,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.637
you're never going to
want to call the option.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:03.844
Rather, you're never going
to want to call the stock.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.470
You're never going to want
to exercise the call option.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.200
Because if you did,
you'd be buying something

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.000
for $20 that would be
worth less than $20.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.980
So if the true stock price
is anything less than $20,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.350
this option, at expiration,
is worth nothing to you.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.560
You would never use it.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
Now, it's critical to understand
that this payoff diagram is

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.630
the value at maturity.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.010
Prior to maturity, if the
value of the underlying stock

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.730
is less than $20, the option
could still have value.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.020
Typically it will have value.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.320
Because there's always a chance
that the stock price goes

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.750
above $20 at the maturity date.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.810
So let's be clear that this
is the value of the call

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.150
option at maturity date.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.830
And if it turns
out that the stock

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.020
price is greater than $20,
then the option has value.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.460
And the value increases,
dollar for dollar,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.760
with the stock price above $20.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.020
So the slope of this
line is 45 degrees.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.070
It literally goes up in lockstep
with the underlying stock

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.210
price.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.900
To be clear, if the
stock price is $25

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.200
and you get to buy it
for $20, the option,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.510
that right to buy
for $20 is worth $5.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.730
Because the stock
is really worth $25.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.760
So the way you can see that is
you can buy the stock for $20,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.620
with this piece of
paper that you own.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.620
And then you can turn
around and sell that stock

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.730
on the open market for $25.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.200
So you've made that $5 profit.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.610
The important thing about
this diagram, the blue line,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.370
is that the upside is unlimited.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.120
But the downside is
very much limited, at 0.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.860
OK?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.530
So this is an example
of a security that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.760
has an asymmetric
payoff, asymmetric.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.860
The upside is not the
same as the downside.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.420
Remember the payoff of a stock,
or of a futures contract.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.170
It's symmetric.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.834
It's that straight line.

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.250
Here, this is not
a straight line.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.920
It's kinked at the
strike price, K. That's

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.570
a very important feature.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.570
Now, it looks like,
from this diagram,

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.650
this call option is one
of these propositions

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.190
that you hear on late-night TV,
make a $1 million with no money

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.850
down.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.860
Like, there's no way to lose.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.020
How could that possibly be?

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.685
How could we have come up with
a security that has no downside?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.170
Wouldn't everybody want one?

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.670
Yeah?

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.239
AUDIENCE: Well, it
has value [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:02.030
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.520
Yeah, there's no free lunch.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.090
So of course, everybody
wants it if it's free.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.977
But of course, it's not free.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.060
So you have to pay for it.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.170
You have to pay something
today in order to get access

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.420
to this asymmetric payoff.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.180
So the net payoff, that is, if
you were buying the call option

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.240
and paying a certain
amount of money,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.210
then the net payoff
to you would be

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.530
given by the dotted line,
which is the blue line.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:38.680
But you subtract from it
the value of the premium

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.520
that you pay.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.510
It's called an option premium.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.560
But it's just the price of the
option whenever you bought it.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.780
And then if you want to
take into account the time

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.030
value of money, you should take
the future value of that price

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.440
that you paid when
you bought the option.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.580
So if you bought the option
in the beginning of the month

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.034
and it expires at
the end of the month,

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:03.200
you've paid something at
the beginning of the month.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.480
If you want to find
your net payoff,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.830
you could either, at
the maturity date,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.920
subtract from the
blue line the value

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.940
of what you paid multiplied
by the one-month interest rate

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.680
factor, so that you subtract
time t dollars from time t

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.320
dollars.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.870
Or you can do a present value,
where you take the payoff

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.786
and you move it back to
the beginning of time.

00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:30.260
Typically what we
do is we actually

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.890
ignore the time value of
money, just because it's

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.059
a month's worth of interest.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.669
And people don't really
worry about that too much.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.784
Yeah?

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.676
AUDIENCE: Can you
make some inferences

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:43.604
about the future
price of the stock

00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:45.532
by looking at the
price of the option?

00:08:45.532 --> 00:08:47.542
ANDREW LO: Yes,
absolutely, you can.

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:49.500
And we're going to show
you how to do that when

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.333
I give you the asset
pricing formula for it.

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:52.770
But you're absolutely right.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.984
By looking at the
option, that gives you

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:56.400
information about
what's going on.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.780
Just like when I tell you
for crisis management,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.820
if you look at
T-bills today, you

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.420
get a sense of how much demand
there is for cash, putting

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.650
money in your mattress.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.750
By looking at
options, you actually

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.690
get a sense of where markets
are going to be going.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.420
So after I give you
a pricing formula,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.940
next time, I'm going to show
you the prices of options.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.356
In particular,
we're going to look

00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:24.600
at the price of a put option on
the S&P 500 for the next month

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.070
and for the next two months.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.370
And you're going to find a
very, very big difference

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.450
in those two.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.060
That's telling you something
about where the market thinks

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.759
volatility is going
in the S&P 500

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.050
over the next couple of months.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.091
So yes, there'll be all
sorts of wonderful things

00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:42.910
you'll be able to tell
by looking at the prices.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.460
But in order to do
that, we do have

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.250
to understand how
these payoffs work.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.330
So getting back
to this diagram--

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.690
I want to make sure
everybody is with me now--

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.080
this dotted line shows
you your net payoff

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.310
and a net of the price you
paid for this particular call

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.360
option.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.120
And the neat thing
about this net payoff

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.650
is that it then describes to
you the fact that this is not

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.690
a surefire way to make
money and not lose any.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.600
You might lose money, because
you paid something upfront

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600
for the call option.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.380
And so the only way you're
going to come out ahead

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.600
is if the stock price
actually exceeds--

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.460
not this point, but actually
something like this point.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.560
So the stock price has to go up
by a little bit more than $20

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.540
in order for you to
make money, net of what

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.140
it cost you to buy that option.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.880
Now, I want you to
go back and think

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.790
about the difference between an
option and a futures contract.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.230
Remember a futures contract
we said was no money down,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.530
0 NPV when you get
into the futures.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.090
That's not true
with a call option.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.800
A call option is actually worth
a positive amount of money

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.330
on day one.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.910
So if you want a
call option, you've

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.440
actually got to pay for it.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.290
And then there's an issue about
whether you'll make money.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.720
Because it depends on
whether the stock price

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.310
exceeds this point.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.190
It's got to exceed not only the
strike price, but the amount

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.810
that you paid for that option.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.980
Any questions about that?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.200
Or is that pretty clear?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.100
So this is important.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.279
So ask now if you
don't quite get it.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.820
Because if you don't
get this, you're

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.194
going to get
confused by what I'm

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:28.860
going to say in a few minutes.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.530
Let me give you another example,
just to really fix ideas.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.890
Let's do the put option case.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.720
Now, the put option allows me to
sell the stock for, let's say,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.740
$20, or before
the exercise date.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:50.130
So with a put option, am I
going to hope if I buy a put--

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:55.680
so I buy the right to
sell the stock at $20.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.620
That's a little bit
hard to keep track of.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.440
I'm buying a piece of paper
that gives me the right

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.510
to sell the stock for $20.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.210
If I own that piece of
paper, this put option,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.555
am I going to wish that the
stock price goes up or down?

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:09.180
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.805
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:11.050
ANDREW LO: Down.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.480
I'm only going to get
paid on the put option

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.990
if the stock price
goes below $20.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.630
Because then I have
something valuable, right?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.720
If it goes below $20, I get
to sell the stock for $20.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.460
So I make the difference
between what it's worth and $20.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.200
If the stock price
is at $20 or above,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.530
then my put option
expires, worthless.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.730
I'm not going to use it.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.896
Because it would be foolish
for me to sell something

00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:39.070
for $20, when I can sell
on the open market for $25.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.630
So the payoff diagram is
exactly the opposite of this.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.610
In fact, it looks like this.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.120
So now the blue line is
the payoff of the option

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.390
itself, the gross payoff.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.330
$20 and above, it's worthless.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.860
But $20 and below, this
is the 45-degree line.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:09.650
But unlike the call option,
my upside for the put option

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.030
is limited.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.464
Is limited to what?

00:13:12.464 --> 00:13:14.120
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.880
ANDREW LO: Right, 0 or whatever
that is, $10, in this case.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.530
If the stock price goes
to $0, then my put option

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.290
is worth a maximum of $10.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.700
So the upside is bounded
by that $10 limit.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.860
And that's the gross upside.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.699
If I look at the net, I
subtract how much I pay.

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:35.990
And then I get the dotted line.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:41.530
Any questions about
the put options payoff?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.240
Now, just to fix ideas, let
me go back to the call option

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.720
and show the difference
between the stock return

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.490
versus the call option return.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.470
If you take a look at
the call option, again,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.420
it's going to look
like this when

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.490
you subtract from it the price.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.390
But the stock is going to
look like that line there.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.060
Meaning that the stock
return is linear.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.750
But the option
return is non-linear.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.470
And this is one of the most
important and subtle ideas

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.430
with this instrument.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.500
Up until now, all
of the instruments

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.150
that we've looked at stocks,
bonds, futures, and forwards,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.790
their payoffs have
been relatively simple,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.490
in the sense that they're
straight lines if you

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.960
plot the underlying
price and their payoffs.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.370
This is the first time we have
analyzed the security that has

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.980
a bizarre structure like this.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.840
And you might think
it's straightforward

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.910
because well, you understand the
contractual terms of an option.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.980
But from a risk-and-return
perspective,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.110
it's actually quite a
bit more complicated

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.540
than most people
would appreciate.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.140
One of the reasons that we are
in a current financial crisis

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.860
today is because of the
complexity of the securities

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.180
that have been created.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.610
And the complexities are
really along the lines

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.380
of these non-linearities.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.130
As I mentioned to you,
insurance is a put option.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.210
So you can actually use the
theory of option pricing

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.437
to value insurance contracts,
like credit default swaps.

00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:19.270
In fact, the payoff of
a credit default swap

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.740
is not that different from
something that looks like this.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.390
And what that means is that
a portfolio of credit default

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.440
swaps does not behave
like a portfolio of stocks

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.940
or a portfolio of bonds.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.970
They have very
important differences,

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.660
both in terms of their risk,
and in terms of their return.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.590
In this case, you can see
the risk of a put option

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.420
is bounded above.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.130
The upside is bounded above.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.170
The downside is bounded.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.340
But the call option is unbounded
above, in terms of its upside.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.760
Bounded below, in
terms of its risk.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.340
What if, now, you
decided you were going

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.640
to sell somebody a call option?

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.210
Or you were going to
short a call option?

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.201
Can anybody guess what the
payoff would look like?

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.175
Yeah?

00:16:10.175 --> 00:16:12.610
AUDIENCE: If you're going
to sell a call [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.071
agreement that's your payoff.

00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:14.937
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:16:14.937 --> 00:16:16.520
AUDIENCE: As long
as the stock doesn't

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.460
go above the [INAUDIBLE] so
someone can call you out.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.940
Then it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.960
ANDREW LO: So what is
it going to look like,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.010
in terms of the diagram?

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.360
How would I have to change this?

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.220
AUDIENCE: It would
be flat, say, $2.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.615
And then it would go down.

00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:28.890
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.430
It would be a mirror image
of the blue line, where

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.540
you reflect it along the
x-axis, it would go this way.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.560
And what that means is that
your downside is unlimited.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.915
But your upside is very limited.

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:46.540
Now, why would anybody
want to do that?

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.550
That seems like a terrible deal.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.260
Well, the difference
is that you are now

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.700
getting paid to do that.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.930
In other words, if
you flip this image--

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.520
let me draw it here.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:06.270
If you now have a call
option that you've shorted,

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.900
you go down here.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.599
This is $20.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.440
You will get paid
for doing this.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.252
Meaning if you look
at your net return,

00:17:15.252 --> 00:17:16.460
it's going to look like this.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.200
So that means that as long
as the stock price stays

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.230
below a little bit
extra than $20,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.810
you will actually get
to keep that premium.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.682
But if the stock price goes
up, your losses are unbounded.

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:39.390
That's different.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.700
That's a different
payoff structure

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.190
than what we're used to with
traditional instruments.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.550
You can do all sorts
of calculations.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.410
Long Call looks like that.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.880
Long Put looks like that.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.740
Shorter Call looks like this.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.370
And Shorting a Put
looks like that.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:06.050
And once you take all of these
things and put them together,

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.850
you can mix and match and get
some really interesting payoff

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.860
types of structures.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.630
So let me give you an example.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.320
This is just payoff
tables that will show you

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.430
when you get paid what.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.500
So this is a very
helpful exercise for you

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.160
to go through, just to
verify that these graphs are,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.560
in fact, what they should be.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.080
So I would ask you to go
through this on your own.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.440
And there are all
sorts of trade-offs

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.740
that you can
implement by looking

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.110
at these various
different payoffs

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.290
and putting them together.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.640
For example, you can
buy a stock and a put,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.160
or buying a call with one
strike and selling a call

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.730
with another, or buying a call
and a put with the same strike.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.360
Each of these
portfolios of options

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.510
gives you a different
kind of a payoff diagram.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.970
And as a result, it allows you
to make bets on market events

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.730
that you otherwise wouldn't
be able to make a bet on.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.230
So let me give you
an example of this.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.270
Let's see.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.680
Let's do something
like, oh, I don't know.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.320
How about a call and a put?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.840
Suppose you decide
to buy a call,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.150
and you buy a put with the
exact same strike price.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.000
So buying a call at
a strike price of $50

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.280
will give you that left diagram.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.070
And then buying a put with
the strike price of $50

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.980
will give you the right diagram.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.000
And your payoff for
those two, at maturity,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.710
is going to look like a V.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.290
Now, in fact, you have
to subtract how much you

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.690
paid in order to do this.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:50.690
So your net payoff will
be this V, shifted down.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.210
Sorry, I didn't do the
interactive graphics here.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.900
But it's going to look like
this, where what I've done

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.230
is I've subtracted the
amount of money it cost you

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.760
to buy the put and the call.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.430
Yeah, question.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.275
AUDIENCE: In this particular
example, really all

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.690
you're saying is, except for a
short range in the stock price

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.441
around the strike price,
you will always make money.

00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:17.440
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.144
AUDIENCE: So is
there a reason why

00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:20.884
you wouldn't do a
lot of this, if you

00:20:20.884 --> 00:20:22.509
know that there is
some movement that's

00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:23.845
going to happen in the stock?

00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:26.440
ANDREW LO: So the question
is, how much does it

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.460
cost you to do that?

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.240
When you say small,
it's all relative.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.700
You've got to find out
exactly what that is.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.570
The smaller the range
is, the more expensive

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.120
it'll be for you
to actually buy it.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.310
So there's a trade-off.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.450
It's all a matter of
how much you pay for it.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.210
But before I go
there, let me just

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.950
make sure everybody
understands what

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.110
this payoff is accomplishing.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.690
What are you doing
when you are buying

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.920
a portfolio with a payoff
diagram that looks like this?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.440
What you're doing is
saying that you're

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.800
going to make lots
of money if the stock

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.160
price goes way up or way down.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.280
The only way you're not
going to make money,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.830
if the stock is not
doing a whole lot,

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.540
if it's staying around here.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.650
OK.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.430
So this is an example
where you are making a bet.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.260
Not that markets
are going to go up,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.040
not that markets are
going to go down,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.790
but that markets are
going to be wild.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.940
That is, you're making
a bet on volatility.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.530
Which may seem like a
pretty good bet nowadays.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.470
But the problem is that
there's a difference

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.526
between this diagram
and this diagram.

00:21:40.526 --> 00:21:41.650
And what is the difference?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.340
What determines how big or
small this little tiny area is,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.140
where you don't make any money?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.470
What determines that is how
much you have to subtract

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.590
and how far this V
gets shifted down.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.340
And you know what?

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.440
Right now, it's
shifted down a lot.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.030
In other words, it costs a
lot to buy a put and a call.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.080
Why does it cost a lot?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.180
Because volatility is very high.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.120
And when you're buying a
put, you're buying insurance.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.390
It's very, very expensive
now to buy insurance.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.471
Because we're in the
middle of a hurricane.

00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:15.220
And that's probably
the worst time for you

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.345
to buy hurricane insurance,
is when you're actually

00:22:17.345 --> 00:22:19.420
in the middle of a hurricane.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.460
So what that means is, that this
thing has shifted down a lot.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.020
So that means that you have to
have really, really volatile

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.720
markets in order to make money.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.940
So it's shifted down enough
so that supply equals demand,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.057
as you would expect.

00:22:35.057 --> 00:22:36.890
So there's no free lunch
going on out there.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.230
It's priced fairly.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.730
Now, even though
it's priced fairly,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.146
if it turns out that you're
the kind of person that really

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:44.260
doesn't like a lot of
risk and you believe

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.210
there's going to be
tons more volatility

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.060
coming, then for you,
it's worth it to do it.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.600
For somebody else who
doesn't believe that there's

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.470
going to be a lot more
volatility coming,

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.200
it's worth it to be on the
other side of that trade.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.090
By the way, if I'm on the
other side of the trade,

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.020
what does my payoff
diagram look like then?

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.450
If I'm selling a put and a
call, what will it look like?

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.450
AUDIENCE: The opposite.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.180
ANDREW LO: Yeah,
exactly, the opposite.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.880
We're going to flip it, flip
this thing against the x-axis.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:19.030
So it'll be an upside-down
V. But because we're

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.600
shorting puts and calls,
we get money upfront.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.910
So the upside-down V is going
to be pushed up over the x-axis.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:33.600
So it's going to look like
the mirror image of this.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.960
And as long as
stock prices are not

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.950
more volatile than this
range, we will make money.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:48.370
But our downside is
unlimited in both directions.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.370
So you got to be
really confident

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.890
that you know that markets
aren't going to be any more

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.870
volatile than they are now.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.230
Now, if you were Warren Buffett,
and you bought Goldman Sachs

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.210
three, four weeks
ago, and you thought

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.842
it was a great deal
then, well, you

00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:04.050
would have lost money by now.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.910
Warren Buffett has lost money.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.560
On the other hand,
as you all know,

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.200
Warren Buffett doesn't it make
investments for the short term.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.658
He's thinking about
this investment

00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:14.230
as a 10, 20-year investment.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.230
And over 10 or 20
years, I suspect

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.044
it will be a very good deal.

00:24:18.044 --> 00:24:19.710
But if you're looking
at what's going on

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.595
over the next few
weeks, the question

00:24:21.595 --> 00:24:23.220
is, do you believe
that markets will be

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.962
less volatile or more volatile?

00:24:24.962 --> 00:24:26.670
If you do, you're
going to be on one side

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.170
or the other of that trade.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.880
The point is that
this now allows

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.080
us to make bets on volatility.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.540
Whereas before, with
a futures or a forward

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.640
or a stock or a
bond, you only could

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.580
bet on it going
up or going down,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.710
or mispricings
because certain kinds

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.960
of arbitrage relationships
have been violated.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.820
This is the first
time that we've

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.010
been able to make a
bet on wild swings.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.750
And that's a really
amazing thing.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.380
It's an extraordinary innovation
to be able to do that.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.254
It allows individuals to
engage in kinds of side bets

00:25:02.254 --> 00:25:03.920
that they otherwise
wouldn't be able to.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.170
And more importantly, it
allows other individuals

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.027
to insure against certain
kinds of eventualities

00:25:10.027 --> 00:25:11.360
that they'd never be able to do.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.880
Now you can buy insurance
against volatility,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.620
which is a pretty remarkable
thing to be able to do.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.555
OK, so that's just one
example of an option strategy,

00:25:20.555 --> 00:25:21.950
a very simple one.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.670
There are other examples
that I've given you here.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.740
For example, this is
kind of a fun one.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.262
This is two calls.

00:25:31.262 --> 00:25:32.720
That should be a
minus sign, sorry.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.180
Call1 minus Call2.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.820
So you basically
buy a call option,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.210
and you short another one
at different strike prices.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.600
And so what this allows you to
do, this is really interesting.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.850
This gives you upside
from 50 up until 60.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.980
So you buy a call at 50.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.880
You're short a call at 60.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.150
So that means you're going to
get upside between 50 and 60.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.340
And then nothing after that
and nothing before that.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.770
Now, this seems like a
really ridiculous strategy

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.520
to engage in.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.840
Why would you want to
cut off your upside?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.350
Because with a call, if
you just bought a call,

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.240
you'd basically get
all of the upside.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.470
Right?

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.030
Why would you ever
want to do this?

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.680
Anybody tell me what
the logic for that is?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:19.890
Yeah.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:20.355
AUDIENCE: Because it's cheaper.

00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:21.330
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.090
It's cheaper.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.110
It's cheaper because when
you short the call at 60,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.640
you're getting money today.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.580
So that helps you
finance the call at 50.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.030
It's cheaper, but
it's not a free lunch.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.130
What you're getting in
exchange for that extra premium

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.180
is you're giving up any profits
above and beyond the stock

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.010
price going above 60.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.070
So you're giving up
the unbounded upside.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.590
And you're bounding it at 60.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.420
But the benefit of
giving up that upside

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.680
is that you now have some money
to reduce the cost of getting

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.510
that call at 50.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.680
OK?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.380
And so you might use
this if you think,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.700
well, I suspect that the stock
has got some room to grow.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.420
I think it will bounce
around between 50 and 60.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.120
But I can't possibly
see the stock

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.960
ever being worth more than 60.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.130
So I'm happy to give up that
upside to other people who

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.370
are more optimistic than me,
and get some money for it

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.530
and help me to finance my
purchase of the stock at 50.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.720
So it's cheaper.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.830
That's the bottom line.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.750
Another way of
looking at it is, you

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.770
have to move this whole diagram
down by how much it costs.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.200
It turns out you move it down
by less than if it were just

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.600
the pure call option by itself.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.040
So the way you can think of
it is you buy the call option.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.090
You move it down by that much.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.290
And then you sell the other
call and you move it up

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.780
by the amount of that 60 call.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.000
So you can do this.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.200
You can do this in reverse.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.324
You can bet on the
downside, in that way.

00:27:56.324 --> 00:27:57.740
You can do something
that's called

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:04.040
a butterfly spread, where
basically it looks like this.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:13.400
So the payoff if it stays
within a range, you get paid.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.450
But if it's really volatile,
then you don't get paid.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.584
So you're willing to give
up the upside on both ends

00:28:20.584 --> 00:28:23.000
because you think the stock
is going to be self-contained.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.360
You're betting against
volatility increasing,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.760
and you're using
the ability to get

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:35.010
rid of those unbounded gains
to finance the positions.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.680
And it turns out that with
these kinds of payoffs,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.030
you can prove mathematically
that it's possible to generate

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.910
any other payoff in the world.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.680
There is a mathematical
result that's

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.600
actually related to this Taylor
approximation and Fourier

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.350
expansion that says that any
possible security that you can

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.730
come up with can be approximated
by a sequence of calls

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:02.900
and puts.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.450
That's a really powerful idea.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.092
But in fact, from a
practical purpose,

00:29:07.092 --> 00:29:09.050
you don't even need to
use anything that fancy.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.620
If you have just a very small
number of calls and puts,

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.470
you can put together
extraordinarily complex payoff

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:20.240
diagrams that will get you
whatever kind of a risk profile

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.310
you're looking for.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.670
That's the power
of option pricing.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.700
OK, any questions about
these payoff diagrams?

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.190
I would urge you to work
through a few examples just

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.980
to make sure you
really understand them.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.316
Because it's a easy thing to
think that you understand.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:38.440
But unless you're forced
to go through the exercise

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.210
and draw these
diagrams, you won't

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.090
have an appreciation
for how to do them

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.630
and how important they are.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:46.774
Yeah, question.

00:29:46.774 --> 00:29:48.662
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious for a while,

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:54.616
is there any
implicit volatility,

00:29:54.616 --> 00:30:00.028
I mean implicit in the price of
an option and a call and a put,

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:01.996
is respective volatility
of the market.

00:30:01.996 --> 00:30:05.440
But how much inside that
price is it actually

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.916
generating volatility itself?

00:30:06.916 --> 00:30:08.392
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:11.162
The price, the call
could also be a motor

00:30:11.162 --> 00:30:12.328
of volatility in the market.

00:30:12.328 --> 00:30:13.780
ANDREW LO: Yes. .

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.790
That's a great question.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.730
Let me repeat it.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.360
In fact, that question
was asked shortly

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.485
after Black and Scholes
came up with their formula.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.560
It created the whole
literature, which

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.610
was started by our very own
former Dean, Dick Schmalensee.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.050
He wrote a paper
with a fellow named--

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.100
I think it's Robert Trippi,
small Schmalensee and Trippi.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.450
They wrote a paper on implied
volatilities of options.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.960
So the ideal is that
options are actually

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.700
dependent on volatility.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.924
And I'll show you that not
this time, but next time.

00:30:48.924 --> 00:30:50.590
I'm going to go through
a pricing model.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.548
And you're going to see
how volatility actually

00:30:52.548 --> 00:30:54.250
plays a very concrete role.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.630
So they came up with
a brilliant idea.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.661
Let's take a look
at an option price.

00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:00.160
And we know what
the stock price is.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.300
We know what the
strike price is.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.883
We know what the
other parameters are.

00:31:02.883 --> 00:31:06.160
Let's ask the question,
given the price of an option,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.580
what is the volatility that
is consistent with that market

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.960
price?

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.650
Because allowing you
to invert the market

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.350
price for the
volatility gives you

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.850
information about
what's going on.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.350
It's exactly the
question you asked,

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.620
about information implicit
in the market price.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.759
It turns out that that's
done all the time.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.300
And not only is it
done all the time,

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.630
but there is now an index that's
been created by the Chicago

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.620
Board Options Exchange
called the VIX, which

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.120
stands for the
Volatility Implied Index.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.680
What they do is they look
at options on the S&P 500.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.440
And they ask the question,
what is the volatility that

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.410
is consistent with the
option price on the S&P

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.060
for at-the-money option.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.800
At-the-money means
the strike price

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.890
is equal to the current price
of the stock, or the index,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.280
of this case.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.027
And that's an incredibly
important concept.

00:32:01.027 --> 00:32:02.860
Because that tells you
something about where

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.580
the market sees volatility
going forward, not just looking

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.420
backwards.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.750
But today, right now, what does
the market think volatility

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.140
should be?

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.420
And if you look at the VIX
over the last few weeks,

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.170
you're going to be shocked.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.600
We're going to take a look
at it next time, next Monday.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.090
I'm going to do this in class,
where I'll show you what

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.770
that volatility looks like.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.690
Historically, the S&P 500 has
had a volatility level of what?

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.564
Does anybody know?

00:32:28.564 --> 00:32:30.355
What's the typical
stock market volatility?

00:32:30.355 --> 00:32:31.530
AUDIENCE: About 15%?

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.770
ANDREW LO: 15% to 20%.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.520
Yeah, it's bounced around
there, on an annualized basis.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.500
Last week on an
intradaily basis,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.440
the VIX index, which is
the Implied Volatility,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.305
reached an interdaily high of
89% volatility, for the stock.

00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:48.930
And right now, I
don't know what it is.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:49.930
I haven't checked today.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.544
But my guess is it's
probably 60 to 70.

00:32:52.544 --> 00:32:53.340
AUDIENCE: 71%.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:53.820
ANDREW LO: Is it, what?

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.570
AUDIENCE: 71%.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.440
ANDREW LO: 71%.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.680
OK, 71% annual volatility.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.830
Now, that's the forward-looking
implied volatility

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.180
for S&P options.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.160
And what that tells
you is that we're

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.290
in for some turbulent
times ahead.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.580
If you look at the implied
volatility for the one year

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.370
contract, it's going
to be much lower.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.840
Because people are
going to expect

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.320
that the volatility of the
S&P, going forward in time,

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.960
is going to decline between
now and a year from now.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.890
At least, we hope so.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.570
Otherwise a lot of
people are going

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.350
to be needing zan--
zan-- what is it?

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:32.500
Zantac and other kinds
of pharmaceuticals.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.780
OK.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.970
So those are option diagrams.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.340
And I want to mention
one last thing

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.260
before we go to the history
of option pricing theory.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.860
I want to mention that one
of the reasons option pricing

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.180
theory has been so
important in finance

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:55.260
is because soon after the papers
by Black and Scholes and Merton

00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:02.140
were published, it became clear
that everywhere you looked,

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.890
there were options to be found.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.370
That is, all other kinds of
financial securities, when

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:14.630
you looked more closely, they
were actually options as well.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.880
So let me give you an example
I said before that stock

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.120
prices were not like options.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.780
Well, as an approximation,
that's true.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.310
But in reality, if you look
carefully at what a stock is,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.760
in fact, a stock is an option.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.400
So let me see how that is.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.870
Well, equity, the
equity of a corporation

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:45.010
is a claim on the
corporation's assets.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:50.050
But if that corporation has any
kind of debt financing, then

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.409
actually the equity
holders are second in line.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.380
The bondholders
are first in line.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.950
So the equity only gets
paid after the bondholders

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.570
get paid off.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:05.110
So in particular, if you
think about the maturity

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.920
date of the bonds,
then on maturity date,

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.780
the value of the equity is
the maximum of either 0,

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.540
or the value of
the firm's assets

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.780
minus the face
value of the bond,

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.110
or what the bond has
to be paid off at.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.090
Because if the bondholders
don't get paid,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.570
then the equity
holders get nothing.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.900
Then the bondholders
get the firm.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.590
All of the assets of the firm
transfer to the bondholders

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.090
through bankruptcy proceedings.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.920
At least, that's the theory.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:43.110
So the value of the equity on
the maturity date for the bonds

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:48.750
is actually the maximum
of 0, V minus B.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.700
Now, that should look
very familiar to you.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.550
That should look like the
payoff of a call option.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:36:00.050
Where the strike price
is B, and the value

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:06.310
of the underlying security is V,
the value of the firm's assets.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.920
So what that means is
that equity holders can

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.000
be viewed as owning an
option on the firm's assets

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.010
with a strike price of B.
And the bondholders look

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.210
like they have a put option.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.560
They've shorted a
put on the firm.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.970
But that's leveraged with
a certain amount of debt.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.980
It's a protected levered put,
is the way that people usually

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.760
put it.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.860
So the debt is the
minimum of V or B.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.840
You either get the
assets, or you get what

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.450
you owed, which is smaller.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:45.560
And you can show that that's
equivalent to B minus max of 0B

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.730
minus V. That looks like
a short put position mixed

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.250
in with some borrowing.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.750
And when you add the two, you
see that the value of the firm

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.125
is equal to the
value of the debt

00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:56.480
and the value of the equity.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.350
The point of this example
is that option pricing

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:05.120
can be used to value the capital
structure of a corporation

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.650
as well.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.230
And within the last few
years, a very active part

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.990
of the hedge fund
industry has been

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.810
devoted to engaging in something
called capital structure

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:18.980
arbitrage.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.740
Capital structure arbitrage says
that this equation has to hold.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.920
But in practice,
there is a discrepancy

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.660
with what the market value for D
is, and the market value for E.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.380
And using option pricing theory
and models for credit risk,

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.070
hedge funds have been able to
make a play by either buying

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.740
a company's equity and shorting
their debt, or buying the debt

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.948
and shorting the equity,
whichever is cheaper or more

00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:48.220
expensive, and engaging in
what seems like an arbitrage

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.210
transaction.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.700
Now, that presupposes
that you've got the credit

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.990
calculations done correctly.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.170
So in order to engage
in those kind of trades,

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.720
you have to have
superior credit modeling

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.060
capabilities, certainly
better than what

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.290
rating agencies were doing.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.230
And actually, there were cases
where hedge funds were actively

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.630
betting against
rating agency models.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.990
Because they felt that
rating agencies had mispriced

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.490
some of their ratings based upon
the models that they'd created,

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.800
versus the ones the rating
agencies were using.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.330
Now, turns out that when
you look more carefully

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:31.010
at other securities, and even
other kinds of opportunities,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.990
options are there as well.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:40.350
For example, when I started
here at MIT, 20 years ago,

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:44.510
I remember, distinctly,
some of my senior colleagues

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:49.610
referring to Assistant
Professors as options.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.910
Now, let me explain.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.700
You know that in academia,
when you start out

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.920
as a Assistant
Professor, there's

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.560
no guarantee for employment.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.500
You have, typically,
a three-year contract.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.720
And at the end of three
years you either get renewed

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.520
or you get fired.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.260
And at the end of
the next three years,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.590
you come up for what's
called a tenure review.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.450
Tenure review means
that they send letters

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.560
to 15 of the top people in
your field across the country.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.280
Across the world, actually.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.750
And they base their decision
on whether to give you

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:28.040
lifetime guaranteed employment,
as to whether or not

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.240
these 15 people say
that you're the greatest

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.370
thing since whatever.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.960
And if you don't get
that kind of review,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.397
then you're asked to leave.

00:39:40.397 --> 00:39:41.480
I mean, you have to leave.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.910
There's no choice for
continued employment.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:48.500
So the idea behind hiring
Assistant Professors

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.430
were that each one of them
was viewed as an option.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.220
Meaning that you could
benefit from them for a while.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.180
But if they didn't work out, you
could always get rid of them.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.470
But once you got
tenure, that was it.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.110
There was no longer an option.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.370
So what that suggested,
from a hiring perspective,

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.080
is what kind of
Assistant Professor

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.680
should you hire if you
believe in option pricing,

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.730
as applied to the labor market?

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.267
Can you can you
characterize the type of--

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:20.100
Yeah, what was that?

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:20.540
AUDIENCE: Take risks.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.670
ANDREW LO: Take risks.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:27.260
You want to hire faculty
that are extremely volatile.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.640
Not emotionally, hopefully,
but intellectually.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.330
In other words, because
you get all the upside,

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.961
but you don't get any downside.

00:40:35.961 --> 00:40:37.960
So what you want to do
is you want to take risk.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.430
You want to take chances on
faculty that may or may not

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.150
work out.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.580
And that, in fact,
has been the approach

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.400
that we and others have
used in hiring, based

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.500
upon this kind of
option pricing analysis.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.420
And it applies to
all sorts of things.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.310
When you think about
getting an education,

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.030
you can argue that getting
an education is an option.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.720
You don't have to
use your degree.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.910
You don't have to
use your education.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:01.576
But you have it.

00:41:01.576 --> 00:41:02.800
It's an option.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.880
And so thinking about value in
education, you could actually

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.550
use this framework, try
to compute the flexibility

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.700
it gives you, in order
to take advantage

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.150
of career opportunities.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.010
So there are lots of things
that look like options.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.502
Yeah, Megan?

00:41:20.502 --> 00:41:28.438
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] distressed
debt manager, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:38.854 --> 00:41:41.470
ANDREW LO: A
distressed debt manager

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:43.810
if they're holding
distressed debt of a company,

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.870
they would actually be
holding a short put position.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.130
They're holding the debt.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.642
So they have a
short put position.

00:41:49.642 --> 00:41:51.100
So if they wanted
to hedge it, they

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.100
can either buy a
put on the assets,

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.023
which would then help them
to hedge it out, Yeah, right.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.610
And as I was saying,
there are all sorts

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:10.400
of other examples of options
and derivative securities.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.020
The field has exploded.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.380
There are literally
many, many trillions

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.690
of dollars of notional amounts.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.440
Now, again, notional amounts
can be a little bit misleading.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.200
Because you know that
for every option seller,

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.250
there's an option buyer.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.650
Options are zero net
investment side bets,

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.910
unlike equities,
where companies that

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.860
have real assets behind
them issue pieces of paper

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.880
called equity.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.180
Options are issued by
the Options Clearing

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.510
Corporation for the Chicago
Board Options Exchange.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.310
The Mercantile Exchange
also has options.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.060
There's options
traded everywhere.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.852
In fact, one of the
largest exchanges

00:42:46.852 --> 00:42:48.560
is the International
Securities Exchange.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.360
It was started up
by Bill Porter,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.130
the fellow who started e-trade.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.550
And it is the most active
options exchange in the world.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.290
It's all done electronically.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.410
And these options
are pure side bets.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.265
But they're not just for
purposes of gambling.

00:43:04.265 --> 00:43:07.760
They're for purposes of hedging
and engaging in insurance,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.260
of the kind that we
talked about before.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.250
So this has really exploded.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.310
And that's why we have an
entire course, 15.437, devoted

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:20.780
to just the pricing of
options and futures.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.730
So we can't, obviously, cover
all of it in this course.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.770
But I want to just give
you a flavor of it.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.590
Let me skip, now,
this next section

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.079
on valuation of options.

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:34.370
Because as I said, this is
a little bit more technical.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.036
I want to spend some
time on it and make

00:43:36.036 --> 00:43:37.790
sure you all understand it.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.070
And then I will come
back to this on Monday.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.320
When I want to do now is
just to give you a little bit

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.760
of a history of option pricing.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.710
Because it's kind of fun.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.910
First of all, in order to
figure out how to price options,

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.240
we have to begin
with figuring out

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.020
what a particular model would
be for the underlying stock.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.150
In order to price an
option, you actually

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.060
have to say something
about how the underlying

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.310
security behaves.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.840
So we have to start with that.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.910
And we're going to start in
the very early 16th century,

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.710
with probably the first-known
model for asset prices

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.800
that ever existed in the world.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.130
And that was developed by
a Italian mathematician

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.650
by the name of your
Gerolamo Cardano.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.960
Now, those of you who were
on high school math team,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.440
I suspect you've
heard of Cardano.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.550
Anybody tell me who Cardano was?

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.210
No math team geeks here?

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.280
All right, Cardano
was, it turns out,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.680
the second person
to have come up

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.266
with a solution for
the cubic equation.

00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:48.390
You all know what the
quadratic equation is, right?

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.430
You know, ax squared
plus bx plus c equals 0.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.600
That's a quadratic equation.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.140
Anybody know what the
solution of that is?

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.269
Yeah, what is that?

00:44:58.269 --> 00:45:02.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.020
Great Great.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.936
All right, You get the
pocket protector award.

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:07.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.750
Very good.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.790
It turns out that
there is exactly

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.285
the same kind of solution
for the cubic equation.

00:45:13.285 --> 00:45:14.660
Of course, nobody
remembers that.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.243
I won't ask you
whether you know that.

00:45:16.243 --> 00:45:17.010
You might.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.270
But there is a formula
for the cubic equation.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:22.915
It turns out that there are no
more formulas beyond the cubic.

00:45:22.915 --> 00:45:24.290
So there's something
very special

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.670
about the cubic equation.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.670
And this Italian
mathematician, Cardano,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.840
was the first to publish it.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.340
The reason I say that
he's the second person

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.006
to come up with it,
is that it turns out

00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:36.200
he stole the formula from a
colleague, and a colleague who

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.940
had actually come up
with the solution.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.190
And Cardano heard about
it and said, well,

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.374
please tell me what it is.

00:45:41.374 --> 00:45:42.790
And the other
person said, I'm not

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:43.540
going to tell you what it is.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.080
Because you're going to just
write it up and claim credit.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.210
And Cardano says no,
no, I promise I won't.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.710
And then the guy says,
all right, here it is.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:50.290
He told him.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.390
And then Cardano did,
in fact, rip him off.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.010
So it's known as
Cardano's formula,

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.790
but it really shouldn't.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.980
And I'm embarrassed to say,
I don't remember the guy

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.350
who actually invented it.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.770
But Cardano, in addition
to having come up

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.200
with this solution, or
stolen this solution,

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.070
Cardano also wrote
a book on gambling.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.920
And this book, which
is titled Liber De Ludo

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.980
Aleae, The Laws of
Gambling, he developed

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:21.470
what was the precursor to the
modern mathematical description

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:22.910
of stock prices.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.787
And it was described
in this way.

00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:26.870
"The most fundamental
principle of all in gambling

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:28.910
is simply equal conditions, e.g.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.060
of opponents, of bystanders,
of money, of situation,

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.180
of the dice box,
and the die itself.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.600
To the extent to which you
depart from that equality,

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.540
if it is in your opponent's
favor, you are a fool,

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.630
and if in your own,
you are unjust."

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.310
It turns out that
what he was describing

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.860
was, essentially, a 50/50 bet.

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.740
Or what we call a
fair game, or what

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.980
is now known as a martingale.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:00.980
A martingale simply says that
expected winnings and losses

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.850
is equal to 0.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:05.750
Or rather, your expected
wealth next period

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.570
is equal to whatever
your wealth is today

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:14.270
if you have a fair game
that you're betting on.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.100
It turns out that
that simple model

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.250
developed into what we now
think of as the Random Walk

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.060
Hypothesis.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.180
And the Random Walk was
really the fundamental driver

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.150
behind the option pricing
model that Black and Scholes

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.010
and Merton developed.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:30.620
Now, the reason the Random
Walk holds a very special place

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.290
in the hearts of
financial economist

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:35.630
is because most
economists suffer

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:40.610
from a psychological disorder
that we call physics envy.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.220
We all wish that we had
these three laws that

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.110
explains 99% of all behavior.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.170
In fact, economists have
99 laws that explain

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.910
maybe 3% of economic behavior.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:56.870
But there's one example, only
one, in the history of finance,

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:01.520
where an economist actually
came up with an idea

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.930
before a physicist.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.230
And that was later
adopted by a physicist.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.630
And the idea I'm talking about
is the Random Walk hypothesis,

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:13.040
or in the continuous time
realm, Brownian motion.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.600
In 1900, a student by the
name of Louis Bachelier

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.310
was writing a
dissertation in Paris.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:23.840
He was a mathematics
PhD student.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.060
But he was writing about
pricing warrants that were

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.220
trading on the Paris Bourse.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.200
So it was a finance thesis.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.959
And in order to
solve the problem,

00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:35.000
he had to come up with a
mathematical description

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.620
for the underlying price.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.530
And he came up with this
notion of what we now

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:42.350
call Brownian motion,
of Random Walk.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:46.610
And he did it a full three years
before a well-known physicist

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:47.750
published a paper on that.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.130
Anybody know who
that physicist was?

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.088
AUDIENCE: Was it Brown?

00:48:50.088 --> 00:48:50.710
ANDREW LO: No.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.927
No, Brown was many years before.

00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:53.885
And he was a biologist.

00:48:53.885 --> 00:48:54.230
Yeah?

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:55.021
AUDIENCE: Einstein.

00:48:55.021 --> 00:48:58.610
ANDREW LO: That's right,
Albert Einstein, in 1903,

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.250
actually published a paper
on the photoelectric effect

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:02.970
and Brownian motion.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.820
And if you take a look
at what Baschelier did,

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.040
he was working with the
French mathematician

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.200
by the name of Henri Poincare.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.410
Poincare was a very
well-known mathematician

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.380
who was the advisor
to Baschelier,

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.310
and who is renowned
now for a variety

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.310
of different contributions,
including the theory

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.220
of dynamical systems.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.470
Baschelier wrote this thesis
and developed the mathematics

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.570
of Brownian motion.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.370
And when he was
looking for a job,

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:33.590
Poincare wrote a letter
of recommendation.

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:37.220
And this is what Poincare
wrote about Baschelier.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.880
He said that "The manner in
which the candidate obtains

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.014
the law of Gauss is most
original, and all the more

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:45.680
interesting as the
same reasoning might,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.830
with a few changes, be extended
to the theory of errors.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.420
He develops this
in a chapter which

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.010
might at first seem strange.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:57.760
For he titles it
'Radiation of Probability.'

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.270
In effect, the author
resorts to a comparison

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.110
with the analytical theory
of the propagation of heat."

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.040
Now, remember this is
a thesis on pricing

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.620
warrants on the Paris Bourse.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.400
Fourier's reasoning
is applicable almost

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.260
without change to this problem.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.836
Which is so different from that
for which it had been created."

00:50:21.836 --> 00:50:23.460
And of course, his
adviser, at the end,

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.740
always has to complain a
little bit about his student,

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.760
as we all do.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.812
So he said, "It is regrettable
that the author did not

00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:32.520
develop this part of
his thesis further."

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:38.490
What Poincare was mentioning,
with regard to Fourier,

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.740
was the theory of
heat conduction.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.800
In physics, there is
a very standard model

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:48.810
that everybody that goes into
advanced physics will cover.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.570
And that is, how does
heat get conducted

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.280
through a solid medium?

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.370
And in deriving the
equation that ultimately

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.430
is known as the heat
equation, you actually

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.840
use the same theory that
Baschelier applied to pricing

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.100
warrants on the Paris Bourse.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:09.547
He gets what's known as a
partial differential equation.

00:51:09.547 --> 00:51:10.630
And that's it right there.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.090
That's the equation that
he used in his thesis.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.048
If you look at his thesis,
you'll see it there.

00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:15.190
That's the heat equation.

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:17.648
It's the same equation that
explains the conduction of heat

00:51:17.648 --> 00:51:19.380
in a solid medium.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.750
But he derives it
for the purpose

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.270
of pricing this
financial security.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.930
Now, it turns out that
there was one slight mistake

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.805
that Baschelier
made in his thesis.

00:51:29.805 --> 00:51:33.720
It was a mathematical error
that, ultimately, didn't really

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.490
affect the results.

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.980
But it became known.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.080
And when he came
up for tenure, they

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.600
wrote to all the various
different big names.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.060
And he was ultimately
turned down for tenure,

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.040
because they found this mistake.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.750
And he was blackballed.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.110
So he couldn't get a job
except for a small teaching

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:55.204
college, a women's teaching
college in the south of France.

00:51:55.204 --> 00:51:56.870
Which frankly, sounds
pretty good to me.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:06.090
But you know, for
him, it was not

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.160
the way he would not
want to end his career.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.080
But at the end of
his career, it was

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.260
discovered that this
mistake was not as serious.

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.010
And people wrote him
a letter saying, gee,

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.250
you're a great guy anyway.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.400
Paul Samuelson,
actually, was the person

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.680
who discovered
Baschelier's thesis when

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.040
he was in Paris at
the Sorbonne, reading

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.750
through various
different archives.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:31.100
So Paul Samuelson's
responsible for resurrecting

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.050
the reputation and the
work of Louis Baschelier.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.720
You can see his thesis now.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.630
It's been republished
and reprinted.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.080
But the point of the
thesis is that by assuming

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.810
that the underlying stock
price was a Random Walk,

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.420
and by developing the
mathematics of the Random Walk,

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.940
he was able to figure out
what the price of an option

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.310
was on that stock.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:55.140
And it turns out
that the pricing

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.570
of the option on
the stock reduces

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.850
to solving this heat equation.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:01.890
And that explains why
there are, nowadays,

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.665
so many physicists and
mathematicians that

00:53:03.665 --> 00:53:04.290
are in finance.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:08.280
It's because the whole body
of knowledge that comes along

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.040
with the physical interpretation
for the heat equation

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.880
can be applied, virtually
identically and verbatim,

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.820
to the pricing of options and
other derivative securities.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.540
And so very quickly, we can
see that the information that's

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.030
contained in these
market prices can

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.370
be understood within a
mathematical framework

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.900
that we know.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.030
So now going back
to the history,

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.790
it turns out that this was
not known in the 1970s.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:38.840
It wasn't rediscovered by
Paul Samuelson until later on.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.190
The folks that actually
worked on option pricing, that

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.520
tried to figure out the
mathematical prices of options

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.960
were quite a few.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.410
Kruizenga, who is an MIT PhD
student in the 1950s-- oh,

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.680
question?

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.180
No?

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:51.860
OK.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.170
In the 1950s, there
was an MIT PhD student

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.960
of Paul Samuelson's who tried
to work on this problem.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.170
And he actually has a thesis
titled "Put and Call Options--

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.910
A Theoretical and
Market Analysis."

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.560
It's actually in
the MIT archives,

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.120
if you want to go
take a look at it.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.386
But he didn't quite get it.

00:54:06.386 --> 00:54:07.760
He didn't get the
right solution,

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.310
because he didn't have
the mathematical machinery

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.760
to be able to work out
the final elements of it.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.690
K. Sprenkle, a student
at Yale in 1961,

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:21.800
wrote a thesis under Jim
Tobin and Arthur Okun, titled

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.370
"Warrant Prices As Indicators of
Expectations and Preferences,"

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:27.320
and tried to price it as well.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.490
But he wasn't able to come up
with a pricing formula either.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:34.970
And there were a number
of other attempts

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.550
to try to come up with the
appropriate pricing formula,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.850
including attempts
by Samuelson in '65,

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.450
where he had to make assumptions
on individual preferences

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.310
in order to get a price.

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:47.290
That didn't work out.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.520
And then Samuelson and
Merton in '69, they

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.070
tried to come up with
a pricing formula that

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:54.230
was preference free.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.910
And they still couldn't do it.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:58.970
Along came Black and Scholes.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.340
Fischer Black who, at that
time, was a consultant working

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.480
at Arthur D. Little.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.400
He wasn't even an academic.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.480
The Arthur D. Little
building, that's

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.510
the building that
is right over there,

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.220
the one that they
won't let us tear down.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.355
Because it's supposed to be
an architectural gem of sorts.

00:55:18.355 --> 00:55:19.980
That was the Arthur
D. Little Building.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.240
Fischer had his office there.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.230
Myron had his office in the next
building over, Myron Sholes.

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.560
And they started talking
about option pricing.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.610
And Fischer came
up with an analysis

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.400
that was very much along
the lines of Baschelier.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.200
He basically got this formula,

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.620
but he couldn't solve
it because he had never

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.710
heard of the heat equation
because his Fischer Black's

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:46.020
background was in computer
science, not in mathematics.

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.930
It was ironic, because Fischer
Black actually had a PhD.

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:52.170
Not in economics or finance,
but in applied math.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.340
But he had never taken physics.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.670
So he was doing discrete math.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:59.040
So he started talking
to Myron Scholes

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.000
and as legend would
have it, Myron

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.760
took that heat equation, went
over to the math department

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.517
here, and asked one of the
mathematics professors,

00:56:08.517 --> 00:56:09.600
have ever seen this thing?

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.785
And a math person
looked at him and said,

00:56:10.785 --> 00:56:11.910
oh yeah, that's
just heat equation.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.118
Here, you solve it like this.

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:21.150
And so Myron apparently took
it back to Fischer Black.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.620
And Fischer said, hmm,
this is interesting.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.290
We can now write a paper.

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:27.930
And they wrote a paper on this.

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.420
At the same time, Bob
Merton was working

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.670
on another direction
that was trying

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:33.870
to come up with a solution.

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:35.937
Ultimately, he came up
with the same solution.

00:56:35.937 --> 00:56:38.520
They didn't know it because they
had actually not communicated

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.170
to each other.

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:43.194
But ultimately,
Myron and Fischer,

00:56:43.194 --> 00:56:44.610
they sent their
paper to something

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.419
like five economics journals.

00:56:46.419 --> 00:56:48.210
Every single one of
them rejected the paper

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:50.550
saying this is too specialized.

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:51.822
It's not really economics.

00:56:51.822 --> 00:56:52.530
It's not finance.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:55.230
We don't know what
it is, but go away.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:58.050
And it was only until
they were able to change

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:01.020
the title of the paper
from option pricing

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:05.910
to the pricing of options
and corporate liabilities

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.590
that they finally--

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.530
so it was exactly this--
well, I'll show you next time.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.320
They changed it to
start focusing more

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.580
on corporate finance.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.920
They ultimately got
their paper published.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.410
It turns out that Merton used
a very different approach

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.240
but got to the same point.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.320
And so Black and
Scholes got their paper,

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.902
ultimately, accepted
into The JPE.

00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:28.860
Merton got his paper
accepted The Bell Journal,

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.240
both in the same year.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.550
In fact, Merton got his
paper published first.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.770
But he argued that
the paper should

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:38.190
be delayed because he wanted
Fischer Black and Myron

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:40.590
Scholes have their paper
come out in the same year.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.020
He felt that he derived
so much intuition

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.820
for what Black and
Scholes were doing,

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.800
that he didn't want to get
there first, because it was not

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.520
fair to them.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.040
That was one of the
most extraordinary acts

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.837
of professional ethics
in the profession.

00:57:52.837 --> 00:57:55.420
Because it was pretty clear to
both of them what was at stake.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.140
This was a huge problem that
took an enormous amount of time

00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.220
to solve.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.860
And of course, the
rest is history.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.320
They were awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1997, Myron and Bob.

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.350
Unfortunately, Fischer Black had
died of cancer the year before.

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.080
But it was very clear in
the Nobel address, both

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.560
on the participants' part, as
well as the Nobel Committee,

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.840
that Black should have
received it as well.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.180
So that's the history and the
heritage of option pricing.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.250
You can see why MIT is
rightly proud of it.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.941
And given that we're out
of time, let me stop here.

00:58:28.941 --> 00:58:30.690
And then next time,
what we're going to do

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:34.650
is to take up where we left off,
and focus on the actual pricing

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:35.249
formula.

00:58:35.249 --> 00:58:36.540
I'm going to derive it for you.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.910
Not the Black-Scholes formula,
but a simpler version.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:41.340
And you'll see it, and you'll
be able to take a look at it

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.150
and play with it.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:43.180
We'll go on from there.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.970
OK, I'll see you on Wednesday
for the mid-term exam.

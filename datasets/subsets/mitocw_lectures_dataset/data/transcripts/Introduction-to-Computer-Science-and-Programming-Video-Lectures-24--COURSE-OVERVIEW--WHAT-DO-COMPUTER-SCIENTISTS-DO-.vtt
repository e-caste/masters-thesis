00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.390
Today's lecture, mostly I want
to talk about what computer

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.160
scientists do.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.200
We've sort of been teaching you
computer science in the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.060
small, I want to pull back and
think in the large about, what

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.960
do people do once they learn
about computer science?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
And then I'll wrap up with a
quick overview of what I think

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920
we've accomplished this term.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.350
So what does a computer
scientist do?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.700
What they really do is,
almost everything.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.500
Graduates of our department,
other departments, have done

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.310
things like animation for movies
you've all seen, they

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.050
keep airplanes from falling
out of the sky, they help

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.620
surgeons do a better job of
brain surgery, that's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.410
something Professor Grimson
has worked on.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.270
All sorts of exciting things.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.720
Mostly what they have in common,
and it's incredibly

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.220
varied, what you can do with
computer science, but it all

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.260
involves thinking
computationally.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.070
And if I had to use a single
phrase to describe 6.00,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.080
that's the phrase I would use.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.610
The semester is really about
computational thinking.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.390
I think this will be a
fundamental skill used by

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
everyone in the world by the
middle of the current century.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.790
And it'll be like the, it will
become one of the three r's,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.020
reading writing arithmetic.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.810
And I haven't quite figured I
how to put an r in the front

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.780
of it, but sooner or later.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.480
So what is it?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.550
Well, the process is the process
that we've sort of

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.010
been advocating throughout
the semester.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.880
You identify or invent
useful abstractions.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.820
Sometimes they're out there,
and we can just pluck them.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.580
Sometimes you have to invent
them ourselves.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.790
We then formulate a solution to
a problem as some sort of a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.280
computational experiment.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.700
Typically using those
abstractions.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.980
Then comes the part that many
you get bogged down in, but

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.440
it'll get easier for
you as you go on.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.310
Is to design and construct
a sufficiently efficient

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.100
implementation of
the experiment.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.590
And I want to emphasize the
word sufficiently here, in

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.330
that it only has to be
fast enough to run

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.980
it and get an answer.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.130
And it doesn't have to be
the fastest possible.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.070
We then need to validate the
experimental setup, convince

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.390
ourselves that the code is
right, and then run the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.680
experiment, and then evaluate
the results, and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.960
then repeat as needed.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.120
And that's, of course,
the key.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.200
By now you've all learned that
these experiments rarely are

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.040
done the first time
you run them.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.950
But of course, this is true of
experiments in biology and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.040
physics and chemistry
and everything else.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.430
But this is the basic process.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.940
And I think, it's a view that's
not universally held,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.800
but I think is the correct view
of what computational

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.280
thinking is all about.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.520
It's an experimental
discipline.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.830
So the two a's are abstraction,
choosing the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.020
right abstraction, and operating
in terms of multiple

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.390
layers of abstraction
simultaneously.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360
And that's a little
bit tricky.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.070
Something that you've
worked on this term.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.010
You invent some beautiful, high
level of abstraction.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.600
But then you have to think about
it, and implement it

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.620
using the rather low level
abstractions provided by the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.810
programming language.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.130
So we'll do a simulation of,
well, the stock market, we've

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.310
looked at it just recently.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.730
And you've got this abstraction
of a stock, and at

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.230
one level, when we're thinking
about the market, we think of

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.550
a stock abstractly, as something
that has a price

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.580
that moves up and down.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.370
But then at the same time, we
say, well, is the movement

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.830
Gaussian, or uniform, and we're
operating at a somewhat

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.090
different level.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.410
And then at a lower level, we're
asking questions like,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.100
well, how should we
represent it? is?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.940
It a dictionary, is it a list,
that sort of thing.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.000
And we always bounce back and
forth and spend a lot of time

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.590
thinking about how the
layers relate.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.070
Now the other thing that's
important, and it really

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.940
distinguishes, I think,
computing from a lot of other

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.360
disciplines.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.300
Is, we don't just write elegant
descriptions of

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.130
abstractions on paper, the
way you say, would do in

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.980
mathematics.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.210
But we have to then automate
those attractions.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.100
And we always think in terms of,
how can we mechanize the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.490
abstractions?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.510
And that's the computational
part, in many ways.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.120
How can we do that?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.280
Well, we can do it because we
have precise and exacting

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.050
notations in which to express
these models.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.870
So I'll say a few words about
the model of stocks, or a few

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.680
words about the model of a
drunk wandering around a

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.040
field, but I can't get away
with just the words.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.190
Eventually I have to convert
the words to code.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.220
And that's sort of the
acid test of truth.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.620
Have I really understood
what the words mean?

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.580
Because if I don't, I can't
actually convert it to code.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.870
And that's both the cursing
and the bless of being a

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.750
computer scientist. It's
the curse because, you

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.210
can't fake it, right?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.600
And that's one of the reasons
that many students end up

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.620
spending a lot of time in
a course like 6.00.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.260
Because they know whether or
not their program works.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.280
When you write a proof in math,
you can delude we into

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.240
thinking it's a solid proof,
when it isn't.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.120
When you write an essay, you
can delude yourself into

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.520
thinking it's brilliant,
when it isn't.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.250
But here, you look at what it
does, and it either did what

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.500
you thought it would
do or didn't.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.140
And so that means you sometimes
have to work extra

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.550
hard, but the blessing is, when
it's done, you really

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.030
know you've done it.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.790
And you've got something
useful.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.580
And that's because there's a
machine that will execute your

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.450
descriptions.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.030
And that's what makes it fun.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.710
So some examples of
computational thinking.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.720
How difficult is this problem?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
That's what we talked about
when we talked about

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.280
complexity.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.110
And we talked about, for many
problems, for all problems,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.110
there's an intrinsic difficulty
of solving the

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.330
problem with the computation.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.060
Independent of how efficient
your particular solution is.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.800
And then the question is,
how can I best solve it?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.810
Theoretical computer science has
given us precise meaning

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.020
to these and related
questions.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.500
Thinking recursively, another
good example.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.250
Where we take a seemingly
difficult problem, and

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.740
reformulate it into one which
we know how to solve.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.470
Very often, it's a smaller
instance of

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.360
the original problem.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.140
And we say, gosh, this
is hard to solve.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.240
But then we think, well suppose
the list only had two

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.780
elements in it, would I
know how to sort it?

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.430
Yeah.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.480
Well, then we can build up and
say, therefore I can use that

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.620
idea to sort a list
of any size.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.300
As part of this thinking
recursively we learn about

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.990
reduction, we learned how to,
say, reduce the problem of

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.120
deciding what courses to take to
an optimization problem in

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.170
terms of the knapsack problem.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.350
Once we did that, we could say,
oh, we know how to solve

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.840
all knapsack problems, dynamic
programming has been around a

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.550
long time, we'll just do that.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.110
So we do a lot of these
reductions, in betting,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.520
transformations, transforming
one problem into another, and

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.680
simulations.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.430
So some other examples, choosing
an appropriate

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.780
representation, modeling the
relevant abstracts of a

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.100
problem to make it practical.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.700
And this is the essence of
abstraction that computer

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.020
scientists learn, is how to
figure out what's relevant and

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.200
ignore what is irrelevant,
or less relevant.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.760
Focus on the important things.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.250
That's an enormous
skill in not only

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.140
computing, but in life.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.160
We worry about worst-case
scenarios, damage containment,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.560
error correction, all of this
we talked about, we talked

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.210
about debugging, defensive
programming, making sure the

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.770
types were right, but again
these are very general things

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.740
that we think about.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.520
And we think about the fact,
sometimes, it's kind of a nice

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.690
idea, the fact that there exists
really hard problems is

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.120
actually a good thing.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.720
Because that's what let's us do
things like use encryption

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.300
to get privacy of our data,
or privacy for our

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.710
communications, privacy
of our phone calls.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.970
Because we have learned
that some problems are

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.480
intrinsically difficult to
solve, and that's what coding

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.070
is all about.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.470
Or encryption is all about.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.920
That's a nice thing.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.370
I now want to talk more
specifically about what one

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.200
group of computer
scientists does.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.820
And that's my research group.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.610
Which consists of mostly
graduate students, but every

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.170
year I try and incorporate a
few undergraduates in it.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.970
We work in the area of medicine,
it's also the area

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.080
in which Professor Grimson
does most of his work.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.610
The goal is pretty simple: we
want to help people live

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.680
longer and better lives.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.240
Right?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.250
I don't think any of you will
think that's a worthless goal.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.810
But, a second goal is,
we want to have fun

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.520
while we're doing it.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.500
Because life is way too short to
do anything that's not fun

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.310
for very long.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.450
So we push the frontiers of
computer science, electrical

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.530
engineering, and medicine.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.020
Working in close collaboration
with physicians, and here

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.860
you've got logos of some
of the hospitals

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.870
with which we work.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.750
It is, of course, fairly
technical work.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.890
We use machine learning,
clustering, data mining,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.980
algorithm design, signal
processing.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.080
And everything we do ends up,
eventually, getting translated

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.040
to code which we then run.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.990
And so we worry a lot
about software

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.050
systems and the quality.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.440
We do write systems that, for
example, inject electrical

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.040
signals into people's brains.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.910
And it's kind of important,
when you do that, that the

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.750
software does what it's
intended to do.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.680
At least if you like
the people.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.710
So some specific activities, and
this is only a sampling.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.460
We work on extracting clinically
useful information

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.970
from electrical signals
in the human body.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.470
Mostly the heart, the brain,
and connected anatomy.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.310
For those of you who've never
studied anatomy, I've labeled

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.440
the heart and the brain in
the diagram for you.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.570
The two major projects in this
area we've been working on, is

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.920
predicting adverse cardiac
events and detecting and

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.020
responding to epileptic
seizures.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.750
And I want to say a few words
about each of those.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.820
We'll skip this.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.390
So example one, treating
epilepsy.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.635
I suspect most of you are
surprised by the fact that one

00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:27.390
percent of the world's
population has epilepsy.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.170
This is true in almost every
part of the world.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.650
It's true in the United
States, it's true in

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.460
underdeveloped countries
in Central Africa.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.720
It seems to be one of the few
diseases that's invariant to

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.320
economic situations.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.020
One of the reasons that people
are surprised by this number

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.400
is, most folks who
have epilepsy try

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.420
to keep it a secret.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.550
There's a long history, getting
back to witches,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.780
people with epilepsy were deemed
to be witches, were

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.590
burned at the stake, things
of that nature.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.770
People who have epilepsy are not
allowed by the FAA to work

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.670
on maintenance of aircraft.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.990
It's a ridiculous restriction,
but it's in the law, so I know

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.820
someone with epilepsy who's kept
it a secret because he

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.710
doesn't want to lose his job.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.910
That's a different sermon.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.280
It's characterized by recurrent
seizures, generated

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.050
by abnormal electrical activity
in the brain.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.530
It's really less a disease
than a description of

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.100
symptoms, because there are lots
of independent, different

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.000
causes of it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.430
It can be inherited, that's
a significant fraction.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.340
Or it can be acquired, typically
by some sort of

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.560
insult to the brain.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.380
People who have strokes or
serious infections will

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.970
develop epilepsy.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:06.660
Hemorrhages, and increasingly
head injuries.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.290
Turns out to be an illness
that is of now great

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.090
interested the Defense
Department because people are

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.970
coming back from Iraq
with epilepsy.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.670
So those of you who don't have
a strong stomach, you might

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.040
want to avert your eyes.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.310
Here's one manifestation
of it.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.720
On the left is an EEG, and
that's, in this case, a

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.030
recording of the electrical
activity in the surface of

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.780
this girl's brain.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.070
You can see she's wearing what
looks like a very funny

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.630
looking shower cap.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.690
That's where the
electrodes are.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.170
And it's recording the
electrical activity in the

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.090
brain, on the right is
obviously a video.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.560
Well, pretty frightening.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.770
Not all seizures are quite
that frightening.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.570
In fact, most of them are not.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.720
Sometimes people have what are
called absence seizures, where

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.600
they just sort of black out
for a period of time.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.870
Still not a good thing if
you're, say, driving a car

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.700
when that happens.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.150
The key issue here, is that the
onset of the seizure seems

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.380
unpredictable.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.030
And in particular, it seems
unpredictable to the person

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.810
who has the seizure.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.960
And that's the real risk.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.680
Seizures are typically
self-limiting.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.870
They will correct themselves
over time.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:31.180
Eventually this girl will return
to, quote, normal.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.520
The seizure itself will probably
be over in a minute

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.440
or two, and for about an hour
she'll be confused, and then

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.520
she'll be OK again.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.760
But, because they're
unpredictable, even people who

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:50.380
have as few as, say, two a year,
it dominates their life.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.140
So, if you're that girl, and
even if you're going to have

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.350
one of those a year, you're
never going to be

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.090
allowed on a bicycle.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.640
Because if that happens when
you're on a bicycle, it's

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.090
really bad.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.710
If you're an adult, and you
have one or two year, you

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.960
should never drive a car.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.210
Imagine if you've been driving
a car when that happened.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.310
Almost everybody with
epilepsy eventually

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.360
suffers a serious injury.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.730
They have a seizure while
they're on a flight of stairs,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.400
and they fall down and
fracture their skull.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.590
They get intra-cranial
hematomas, they get burns if

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.910
they're cooking at the stove,
they drown in the bathtub.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.030
And it's the unpredictability
that's bad.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.470
Death is high, two to three
times out of the general

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.790
population.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.790
Typically by accident related
to the seizure.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.520
And then there's something
called sudden unexplained

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:50.590
death in epilepsy patients,
SUDEP, which is estimated to

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.270
be one per 100 patients
per year.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.530
Just will die, and
no one knows why.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.030
Frequently it will be at night,
while they're in bed,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.590
and the conjecture is, they
have a seizure, and end up

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.540
face down in the pillow,
smother, that kind of thing.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.780
So you can imagine, if you're
a parent, you have a child

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.820
with this, you don't
sleep much.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.930
Really very sad.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.750
So we want to do something
about that.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.780
And our idea is to detect
the seizure early.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.060
There are two onset times,
electrographic and clinical.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.310
Electrographic is when the brain
first starts looking

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.280
suspicious, and clinical is when
there's a overt physical

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.060
symptom, that stiffness you
saw in that young girl.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.090
Probably it went by too fast for
any of you to notice, but

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.180
if you'd looked carefully at
the EEG on the left of that

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:53.210
picture, you would have seen it
going abnormal before she

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.290
had any clinical symptoms.
Because the symptoms are

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.410
caused by the electrical
activity in the brain, by

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.670
definition, it proceeds the
symptoms, or at least doesn't

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.660
follow them.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.080
So our idea was to try
and detect the

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.140
electrographic onset.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.320
If you could do this, you
could provide warning.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.600
So you could tell somebody, sit
down before you fall down.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.800
Get out of the bathtub.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.460
Back away from the stove.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.150
Just an oral warning would
be tremendously useful.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.370
You could summon help.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.300
You could tell a parent, come
quick, your child is having a

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.640
seizure right now in
bed or elsewhere.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.200
There are fast-acting drugs,
Ativan, which if you inhale at

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.250
the start of a seizure, can
stop it, reduce it.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.930
And our particular interest
is neural stimulation.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.660
There is reason to believe, it's
yet to be proved, that if

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.840
you apply the correct electrical
stimulation at the

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.890
very beginning of a seizure,
you can block it.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.670
Or at least ameliorate
it greatly.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.960
So, here's a picture
of an EEG.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.710
And I'll just point
out, seizures can

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.720
be tricky to find.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.050
You might think this is a
seizure, but it isn't.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.570
That's blinking your eyes.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.980
Oh well.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.900
Here is the seizure, but in
fact, it's begun about here.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.070
Where things don't look
particularly ominous.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:30.080
So it's pretty subtle
to detect.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.060
One of the problems is, EEG
varies across patients.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.610
And epileptics have abnormal
baselines.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:38.900
Yeah?

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:48.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.020
PROFESSOR: Highly variable
in patients, but

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.800
that's kind of typical.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.280
But that would be plenty of
time to back away from the

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.980
stove, or get off a bicycle.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.140
Not so much time to get off the
Mass Turnpike, if you're

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.920
driving a car.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.700
But it would be great,
if you can give 10

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.920
or 15 seconds warning.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.670
In fact, if you could give five
seconds warning, it would

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.280
be tremendously useful.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.290
And for the treatments, it's
even different, right?

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.770
Yes, you're exactly right,
in that particular case.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.590
The problem is, one of the
things I've discovered in

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.360
medicine, my work, is that
almost all healthy people look

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.360
alike, and all sick people
look different.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:40.430
So, EEG, if you have epilepsy,
your quote, normal EEG, when

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.030
you're not having a seizure,
looks weird compared to people

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.810
who don't have epilepsy.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.150
People have been building
seizure detectors for about 40

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.740
years now, and they don't
work very well.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.790
Every EEG that gets shipped
comes with a seizure detector,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.880
and the first thing most
hospitals do is, turn it off.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.400
Because it just doesn't work.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.480
The good news is, that even
though each epileptics brain

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.080
signals look different, once
you've learned what an

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.710
individual's signal looks like,
it's pretty consistent.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.650
Both the interictal, between
seizure, and the

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.500
start of the seizure.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.380
Well, that tells a computer
scientist, let's use machine

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.270
learning to figure out what that
patient's EEG looks like.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.720
And build a highly specific
detector that will work great

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.470
for one person, and not at
all for anybody else.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.770
And then we'll just install
it, and you know, everyone

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.470
gets their own.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:55.400
So instead of one size fits all,
it's design a detector to

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.380
fit the patient.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.810
We have been working on this
now for about six years.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:09.790
We've done, we've looked at
about 80 patients now, more.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.730
And, highly successful.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.180
And I'm not going to weigh you
down with all the statistical

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.210
tests and everything, but we've
done the kind of things

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.950
I talked about in class.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.780
Looking at the data, doing the
statistics, and suffice it to

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.880
say, it works great.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.600
For nine out of 10 patients,
roughly.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.250
And for the tenth, we
just have to say,

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.600
sorry, we can't do it.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.550
But, you know, you can't help
everybody all the time.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.210
We're currently, what you see
here, is a picture of a neural

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.640
stimulator.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.350
The stimulator itself gets
implanted under the clavicle,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.340
and then a wire runs up and
wraps around the left vagus

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.280
nerve, which is the longest
nerve in the human body.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.960
It runs all away from
the head, down

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.780
into the lower intestine.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.770
Latin for wanderer.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.760
Does amazing things, like
control whether

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.410
you're hungry or not.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.680
Its main, one of its main
functions, is it controls the

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.640
parasympathetic nervous
system for the heart.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.180
And it's the nerve that
the brain uses to tell

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.700
the heart, slow down.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.830
But, in addition to transmitting
down from the

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.890
brain, you can transmit
up the nerve.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.300
And in fact, the left one, for
reasons I don't understand,

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.520
translates much better up
than the right one does.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.570
Which transmits much
better down.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.300
So use the left one.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.240
And the notion is, if at the
start of a seizure, we put a

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.870
current on that wire, we
stimulate the brain and we

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.550
stop the seizure.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.340
That's the theory.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.450
It's been shown to stop
seizures in rats.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.780
But I don't much care
about helping rats.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.180
People purport to have shown it
stops seizures in adults,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.420
or in people.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.990
The level of evidence is,
honestly, ambiguous.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.050
Because what they've done is,
they've implanted it, and they

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.160
give the patient a magnet.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.860
And say, when you're having a
seizure, swipe the magnet

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.860
across, sorry about that, swipe
the magnet across the

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.310
stimulator, it will turn it
on and stop your seizure.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.830
Well, could you imagine that
little girl trying to swipe a

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.300
magnet across her chest?

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.870
Not likely.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:33.810
So most people don't
do it successfully.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.110
Some people report, I thought I
was about to have a seizure,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.020
I swiped the magnet and
I didn't have it.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.440
Well, how do we know?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.670
Did they really stop it, or
did they just imagine they

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.100
were going to have one?

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.940
So it's pretty ambiguous, but
we're now in the process of

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.540
doing some real tests
at Beth Israel

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.500
Deaconness Medical Center.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.270
And we've been admitting
patients, and controlling the

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.850
stimulator, and so far
I'm optimistic.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.000
All right, one more example.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.870
Predicting death.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.300
Well, that's kind of
ominous sounding.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.280
About one and a quarter million
Americans have an

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.160
acute coronary syndrome
each year.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.630
That's to say, some sort
of a cardiac event.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:26.010
A heart attack, or an arrhythmia
of some sort,

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.790
various kinds of things,
unstable angina.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.380
And of that one and a quarter
million people, 15 percent to

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.200
20 percent of them will die of a
cardiac-related event within

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.970
the next 4 years.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.530
Pretty high.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:47.980
In fact, about 5% within the
next 90 days, there about.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.150
So what do you do?

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.180
The key thing, we
have treatments.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.850
We actually know how to treat
most of these things.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.960
But we don't know who to
give the treatments to?

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.900
So, for example, who gets an
implanted defibrillator?

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.370
Who should be treated
aggressively with statins?

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.040
We think we've found a new way
to decide who should get which

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.910
of these kinds of treatments.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.130
Something called morphological
variability, which I'll talk

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.410
about only briefly.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.510
We've tested it on a fairly
large database.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.530
We have a database with
about 8,000 patients.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.760
We've looked at 2 days for each
patient, each day has 24

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.460
hours, each hour has 60 minutes,
each minute has, on

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.640
average, 70 heartbeats.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.970
That's a lot of heartbeats.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.080
Over a billion.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.720
So a lot of the techniques we've
talked about this term,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.530
about how do you deal with big
things, I live with every day.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.550
Actually, more accurately, my
students live with every day,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.010
and I commiserate.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:56.350
But the tests are pretty
convincing.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:01.240
As an example, they're implanted
defibrillators,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.300
they, too, go under
the clavicle.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.270
Fortunately we have
two clavicles.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.870
And then they connect to the
heart, and they notice, they

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.440
have a sensor, they notice the
heart is beating very badly,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.060
and they shock the heart.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.950
So you've all seen medical
shows, where people put

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.700
paddles on, say, clear, the
patient goes boom boom, and

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.410
then they say, sinus
rhythm restored.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.310
Well, this does the same
thing, but you

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.020
walk around with it.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.700
Now, you don't want to turn on
all the time, because as you

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.930
can see, it delivers
quite a jolt.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.490
Interestingly, this is an
article from this fall, from

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.970
the New York Times, 90 percent
of the people who get one

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.260
implanted, and the device itself
costs about $50,000,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.100
let alone the cost
of implanting it.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.100
90 percent receive negative
medical benefit.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.890
How do I know that they received
medical benefit?

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:04.190
Well, I know that 90% of them
are never turned on.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.100
Remember, there's a sensor
that decides whether

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.790
to apply the shock.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:12.270
90 percent of them, the sensor
never says, turn on.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.260
So 90 percent of them can
deliver no benefit because

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.120
they're never used.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.410
On the other hand, clearly
having the surgery to implant

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.130
this, is some risk.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.290
So that's why the benefit
is not only

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.400
neutral, but negative.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.970
You've had fairly serious
surgery, you've risked

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.960
infection, and, in fact, this
year several people died.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.900
I think three or four died
when leads broke

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.190
off on these things.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:44.120
So, clearly we're putting in too
many of them, if only 10

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.730
percent are used.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.700
On the other hand, roughly
every one minute and 50

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.860
seconds, somebody in
this country dies a

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.790
sudden cardiac death.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.330
More often once every
two minutes.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:05.680
100 of them during the course
of this lecture.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.080
If these people all had
defibrillators implanted, many

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.120
of them would not die.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.820
So, we have a therapy, we just
don't know who to give it to.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.470
So, what does this look like?

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:25.480
Again, this is pretty
strong stuff.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.660
That's what sudden cardiac
death looks like.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:34.460
An apparently healthy guy,
suddenly he's dead.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.260
It's things like this that
remind us why we can do real

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.310
useful things with our
talents or skills.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.930
So how do you identify
high risk cases?

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.500
Lots of different ways, I won't
go through them, but

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.670
we're focusing again
on the electrical

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.480
signals in the heart.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.670
We're trying to evaluate the
shape of the heartbeat and

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.020
what's going on.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.670
I won't go through details,
the only thing I wanted to

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.010
point out is, we use
dynamic programming

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.630
to actually do this.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.150
So the key idea in our method
depends upon dynamic

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.760
programming.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.350
We've evaluated it
several times.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.540
Here's one evaluation.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.780
We took the 25 percent of the
population that we thought was

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.680
at the highest risk.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.210
And you'll notice that within,
actually the first 30 days,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:34.140
4.19 percent of those
people were dead.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.880
This is a retrospective
study, by the way.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.300
The ECG had been recorded, and
we knew, we had follow-ups on

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.260
them, and of the people we said
were not, the other 3/4

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.680
of the population, a very
small fraction died.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.350
So this is called a Kaplan
Meier curve, and it

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.260
shows a huge gap.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.320
And in fact, roughly speaking,
if we think you were at high

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.930
risk, you were 8 1/2 times more
likely to die within a

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.550
month, within 90 days.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.580
And the good news is, we don't
do this just so we can say,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.350
make your will.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.000
Get your affairs in order.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.350
We actually do this so that we
can say, all right, this is a

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.700
person who should maybe get a
defibrillator, maybe should

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.190
have their arteries
cleaned out.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.900
Maybe should take
a blood thinner.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.860
Once we know who's at risk, we
can do something about it.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.640
All right, all I want to do is
just give you a flavor of the

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.790
kinds of things you've been
learning, are really useful,

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:42.410
and can be used to really do
things that are worth doing.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.220
So wrapping up the term,
what have you learned?

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.350
Well, you know, I think
we'll start with this.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:54.140
If you think what you could do
in September, and what you can

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.880
do now, you've really come
a long way, right?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.080
So try and go back and do
problem set number one, and

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.390
see how long it takes you now,
and how long it took you then.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.590
You'll discover that you really
are at a place you were

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.400
not in September.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.150
We covered five major topics.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.600
Learning a language for
expressing computations,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.390
that's Python.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.000
I already talked about the

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.130
importance of having a notation.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.460
Learning about the process
of writing and debugging

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.470
programs. But more generally,
learning about the process of

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.770
moving from some relatively
ambiguous problem statement.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.990
As you've all noticed in the
current problem set, we left a

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.360
lot of things unspecified.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.680
You know, and the email was
flying back and forth, and

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.680
often the answer was,
you figure it out.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.260
Because that's one of the things
we want you to learn.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.190
To go from some problem
statement to a computational

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.480
formulation.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.410
As a tool to that, you learned
a basic set of recipes, bunch

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.310
of different algorithms. And
you learned how to use

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:09.160
simulations to deal with
problems that did not have

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.780
nice closed form solutions.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.920
Why Python?

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.540
Well, believe it or not, it's
an easy language to learn,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.700
compared to other languages.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.610
Simple syntax, it's
interpretive, which helps with

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.230
the debugging, you don't have to
worry about managing memory

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.760
as you would in a language
like C. It's modern.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.640
It supports, in a fairly elegant
way, object-oriented

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.920
programming and classes, and
it's increasingly popular.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.980
It's used increasing in other
subjects at MIT and other

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.300
universities, increasing in
industry, and a large and

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.920
ever-growing set of libraries.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.440
We talked about writing,
testing, and debugging

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.980
programs. And if I had one
message I want you to remember

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.130
about all of this,
it's be slow.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:10.310
Slow down, take it one step at
a time, take your time and be

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.140
methodical, systematic,
and careful.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.710
Understand the problem first.
Then think about the overall

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:23.300
structure of the solution, and
the algorithms independently

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.710
of how you're going
to code it up.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.890
So you might say, well, I'm
going to use dynamic

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.320
programming.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.720
And that's an independent
decision from Python or Java

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.760
or C++ , or anything else
to implement it.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.830
And in fact, it's pretty easy to
translate a well-organized

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.070
program from one language
to another.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.050
Break it into small parts, and
we talked about unit testing

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.940
and the importance of that.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.140
Nobody can build anything
big in one fell swoop.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:58.590
So, break it into small parts,
identify useful abstractions,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:04.230
both functional and data, code
and unit test each part, and

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.190
first worry about
functionality.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.110
Are you getting the
correct answer?

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.870
And then efficiency.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.550
And a piece of that is, learn
to use pseudo code to help

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.890
yourself out.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.710
As I said earlier, be systematic
when debugging.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.090
Think about the scientific
method.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.300
It's not just something that
we use to torture middle

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.800
school students.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.780
And when you write a program
and it doesn't work, ask

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.730
yourself, why it did
what it did?

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.010
Focus on understanding why the
program is doing what it's

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.550
doing, rather than why
it's not doing what

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.150
you wanted it to?

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.330
Because as soon as you know
why it's doing what it's

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.420
doing, you'll know
how to fix it.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.570
But if you skip that step,
you'll waste an

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:55.020
awful lot of time.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.320
Going from problem statement
to computation.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.360
We said a lot of this, you
break the problem into a

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.630
series of smaller problems.
Ideally, reducing it to a

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.720
problem you already have code
to solve, or somebody else's

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.360
code to solve.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.290
My first instinct when I have to
solve a problem is, I type,

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.450
I go to Google, and I type, I
think about, oh this is really

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.880
an x problem, a shortest
path problem.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.190
I type Python shortest path,
and I see what code

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.990
pops up on my screen.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.920
But I can't do that until I've
realized, oh, it's really a

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.910
shortest path, or it's
really a knapsack.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.160
If I type Python select
courses, I won't

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.910
get anything useful.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.590
Think about what kind of output
you'd like to see.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.850
I often start thinking about
a program by first asking

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.610
myself, what's the output
going to look like?

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.660
And I'll actually write
the output down.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.870
And then I'll see if I can't
write a program to generate

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.210
that kind of output.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.500
Often you can take a problem
formulated as an optimization

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.080
problem, a lot of thing reduce
to finding the minimum or

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.440
maximum values, satisfying
some set of constraints.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.570
So when you're given something
like, how do I find the

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:20.530
directions from here to
Providence, think about it as

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.610
an optimization problem.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.700
And also, think about whether
you really have to solve it.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.040
It's very often the case that an
approximate solution is all

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.700
you really need.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.080
And they're a lot faster.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.980
So, we think about approximation
formally, in the

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.010
sense of, say, Newton Raphson,
we looked at, successive

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.550
approximation.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.980
But more informally, an
approximation can be, solve a

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.850
simpler problem.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.330
That you don't really need to
solve the problem you thought

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.520
needed to solve, if you solve
something simpler, it

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.960
will do just fine.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.180
So you don't find the best
solution, you just find a

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.930
pretty good solution.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.560
Or you simplify the assumptions
and say, well, I'm

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.050
going to find directions, and
to make my problem a little

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:16.480
simpler, I'm not going to allow
myself to take any roads

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.790
except highways to get from
city a to city b.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.740
It may not be the shortest, but
it's an easier problem to

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.120
solve because are so
many fewer roads.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.140
We talked about algorithms, we
talked about big o notation,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.990
orders of growth, that's
very important.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.100
We talked a little bit about
amortized analysis, that you

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.336
might want to, say, sort
something first if you were

00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:43.100
going to do a lot
of searching.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.440
We looked at a bunch of
kinds of algorithms.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.380
I've listed them here.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.900
I'm, by the way, going to send
you a list with all this stuff

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.750
on it, among other things,
so don't feel you need to

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.700
transcribe it.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.890
But a lot of, surprisingly large
number of algorithms, to

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.680
cover in one semester, when
you think about it.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.520
Exhaustive enumeration,
successive approximation,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.880
greedy, divide and conquer,
decision trees, dynamic

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.910
programming.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.860
Quite a lot.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.580
Specific algorithms and
specific optimization

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:18.890
problems. We spent a lot
of time on simulation.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.810
It's important, but maybe not as
important as all that time,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.350
relative to the semester, but
it gave me an excuse to talk

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.120
about some things that
I wanted to cover.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.760
So it gave me a framework to
talk a little bit about

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.380
probability and statistics.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.950
And it's my view, personally,
that every MIT student should

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.880
be made to take such a course.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.190
Since they're not, I tried
to sneak it in here.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:49.460
But it's all, it's important
stuff to know.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.060
It gave me an excuse to build
some interesting programs. So,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.130
what I hope you noticed, is as I
went through these things, I

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.810
actually tried to develop the
programs incrementally, to

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.590
talk about the abstractions,
to talk about how

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.260
I would test them.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.980
And so, just as important as the
simulation itself, was the

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.330
process of building
the simulation.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.380
And so I just shows that as a
mechanism to go through some

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:25.080
case studies of building some
interesting programs. It let

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.870
us talk about random choice.

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.750
Much of the world is, or
at least appears to be,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.430
stochastic.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.810
And therefore, we have to model
randomness in programs.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:40.470
And even we don't have to, it
can be used to solve problems

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.930
that are not inherently
random, like finding

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.400
the value of pi.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.550
It let us look at the issue
of assessing the

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.340
quality of an answer.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.840
We look at things, said, do we
believe that that answer is

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.860
right or not?

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.800
And building models of, at least
parts of, the world.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.440
Some pervasive themes that
we talked about.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.430
The power of abstraction,
systematic problem solving,

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.790
these will be useful even if
you never again write a

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.820
program in your whole life.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.430
What next?

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.280
Well, many of you, almost all of
you, have worked very hard

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.860
this semester.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.020
I hope you feel that you've
got a return on your

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:20.620
investment.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.320
Only you know that.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.990
As I said earlier, take a look
at the problem sets, and see

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.300
whether you think you've
learned anything.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.400
I'd like you to remember after
you leave this course, that

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.610
you've got a skill you can use
to solve problems. And when

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.310
you sit down, and there's some
issue that you don't know,

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:44.190
just knock out a program
to get your answer.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:48.400
I do it all the time, and
it's very useful.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.250
If you want to take more
courses, there are

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.190
others you can take.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.370
6.01, the first course
for Course 6 majors,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.780
you will find easy.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.000
Experience says, people who
take 6.00 first don't

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.470
understand what all the
fuss is about 6.01.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.840
You'll also find it fun
and interesting.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.810
6.034, the introduction to
AI, is now using Python.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.530
You know everything you need
to know to take that.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.580
6.005, which is software
engineering, you know

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.490
everything you need
to take that.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:25.280
And, for many of you, you can
take 6.006, which is a really

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.310
interesting kind of
algorithms course.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:31.570
More advanced algorithms,
particularly those you who

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.930
like math would find
6.006 really fun.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.590
So if you want to take
more courses, there

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.300
are courses to take.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.630
Thank you all, good luck with
the rest of the semester.
